Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend has some \"silly ideas\" about sex, thinking it's the most important thing in his life and a \"get out of jail free card.\" She uses sex to persuade him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author admits they let this go on for too long because the sex is great. \n\nThen, the girlfriend asked him to work at her mom's house on his only day off, promising good sex afterward. He turned her down because he's tired and just wants to relax. This made her angry, and the author had to explain that while sex is good, it's not everything. He also said she thinks too highly of herself, which might have been over the line, especially since she often uses sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, mutual respect, and healthy boundaries. The author is asserting his right to say no to her request, which is his prerogative. He's also challenging the idea that sex should be used as a bargaining tool. However, he might have crossed a line by saying she thinks too highly of herself, which could come off as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he was wrong for setting a boundary. Healthy relationships require communication and respecting each other's limits. The author is correcting her misperception that sex is the most important thing, which is a valid point. However, the way he communicated this might have been harsh, especially the part where he says she thinks too highly of herself. That could have been more respectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's approach of using sex as a bargaining chip is problematic. It's not healthy for either partner. The author is recognizing that and trying to address it, which is a positive step. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for standing up for himself in this situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author admits he's at fault for letting the situation continue, so he's self-aware. The conflict arises from her overstepping and him finally setting a boundary. It's important to note that while it's okay to set boundaries, how it's done matters. The author might need to approach these conversations with more empathy next time, but in terms of the immediate situation, he's not necessarily in the wrong for asserting his needs.\n"
