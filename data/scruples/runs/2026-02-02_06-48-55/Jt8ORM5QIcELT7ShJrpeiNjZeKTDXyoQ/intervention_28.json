She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about correcting the record regarding sex with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend has some \"silly ideas\" about men and sex, thinking it's the most important thing and uses it as a bargaining chip. The author admits he let this go on for too long, which shows he might have enabled her behavior. Now, when he turned down her request to work at her mom's house, she got angry. He had to explain that sex isn't the end-all-be-all and that he needed to relax instead. He even went as far as saying she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits was over the line.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points are: the author allowed the girlfriend's manipulative behavior to continue, then finally set a boundary. He did correct her, but maybe in a harsh way. The girlfriend's use of sex as a bargaining chip is a red flag, but the author's response might have been too harsh. However, the author is also taking responsibility by saying he's at fault for letting it go on too long. \n\nIn relationships, communication and boundaries are important. The author setting a boundary is valid, especially if the girlfriend was using manipulation. But the way he corrected her might have been hurtful. However, the initial problem was her using sex as a tool, which is manipulative. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for himself after enabling her behavior. On the other hand, his words (\"she thinks way too highly of herself\") could be hurtful. But the main issue is her using sex as a bargaining chip, which is problematic. The author correcting the record by stating that sex isn't everything is necessary for a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did correct her, which is right, but the approach might have been harsh. However, given the context of her manipulative behavior, maybe it's justified. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but considering his actions were to set a boundary after enabling her, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to consider if there's a better way to handle it. The key is that he took responsibility and tried to communicate his needs, even if it came off as harsh. So overall, I think B is the answer here.\n"
