She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author correcting their girlfriend about the importance of sex in their relationship. The girlfriend had been using sex as a bargaining chip to get the author to do things he didn't want to do. The author finally set a boundary by refusing to spend their day off working for her mom, leading to an argument where the author made some harsh comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they allowed the situation to continue for too long, which shows some self-awareness. They admit that sex is great but isn't everything, which is a valid point. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship, so refusing to comply with the girlfriend's demands when he's not up for it seems reasonable. However, the way he communicated his refusal might be problematic. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself if needed could come off as dismissive or hurtful, especially if he usually complies with her requests. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative, but the author's response might have been too harsh. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the context. He was setting a boundary, which is good, but the manner in which he did so could have been more constructive. The author also admits that his comments were possibly over the line, which indicates some regret. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had previously used sex as a way to get his needs met, then he might have contributed to the dynamic. But given that he's now trying to correct the record and set healthier boundaries, he's making a positive change. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling rejected or devalued, but the author's right to prioritize his own well-being is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He's taking steps to address an unhealthy dynamic. However, his approach could have been more empathetic. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's setting necessary boundaries, even if the delivery was rough. The main issue was the girlfriend's manipulative behavior, and the author is trying to correct it, which is a positive action.\n"
