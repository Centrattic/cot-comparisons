She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy correcting his girlfriend's view that sex is the most important thing and the main way to get things done. The guy turns down her request to work at her mom's house because he's tired, and then he ends up saying some harsh things to her, which she took as over the line.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, which the author says is a problem. He admits he let it go on too long. He's not entirely at fault for that, but now he's pushing back. When he says no to her request, the conversation gets heated. He tells her she thinks too highly of herself, which she might interpret as dismissive or disrespectful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is setting a boundary, which is important. He's trying to correct the imbalance in their relationship where sex is overemphasized. The girlfriend's behavior of using sex to manipulate or get her way is problematic. The author is right to address that. However, the way he communicates his boundary might be the issue. Saying she thinks too highly of herself could come off as an insult, especially if it's not delivered with empathy. The author also mentions that he used harsh words, which might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the core issue is the girlfriend's manipulative behavior and the author is trying to correct it, then he's justified in setting boundaries. However, the manner in which he does it (insulting her) might be where he's in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but maybe that's because they focus on the author's harsh words rather than the underlying issue of the girlfriend's manipulation.\n\nAlso, the author admits he's at fault for letting the situation continue. So he's aware of his role in the problem. The key is whether the correction was handled appropriately. If he had a respectful conversation about the issues without degrading her, that would be better. But in this case, he used a confrontational approach. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if the issue itself is valid.\n\nI need to decide if the author's actions (the harsh comments) make him in the wrong. Since he's trying to correct her behavior but does so in a hurtful way, it's a mix. However, setting boundaries is necessary, so maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but he should have communicated better. The user's thought is that he's wrong, but maybe that's because they prioritize the communication style over the intent. Alternatively, some might argue that correcting manipulative behavior is right, even if the method is rough. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is the manipulation, and the author is trying to fix it, then he's not wrong. However, the way he did it might be problematic. Since the user is conflicted, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing an issue that needs correction, even if the approach could be improved. The key is that the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary, but his communication was flawed. However, the question is if he's in the wrong overall. Since the core issue is the girlfriend's manipulative behavior, the author isn't entirely wrong. So answer B.\n"
