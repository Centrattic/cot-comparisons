She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy is saying that his girlfriend has some silly ideas about sex. She thinks it's the most important thing in his life and uses it as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. He admits he's partly at fault for letting it go on too long because the sex is great, so he goes along with her. But this time, he refused her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. He was too tired and wanted to rest. She got angry, and he ended up saying that she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which he thinks might have been over the line.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The woman uses sex as a bargaining chip. That's a red flag in a relationship. Manipulating someone into doing things by offering sex is definitely unhealthy. The author realized this and tried to correct the record, setting boundaries. However, he did admit that he let it go on for too long, which shows some responsibility.\n\nWhen he finally set a boundary by refusing her request, she got angry. His response was a bit harsh, saying she thinks too highly of herself. That might have been a harsh way to handle it, but the root issue is her using sex as leverage. The author was asserting his needs, which is important in a healthy relationship. People need to communicate their boundaries, even if the method could have been better.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the main issue is her manipulative behavior. The author is trying to correct that by not complying this time. He's standing up for himself, which is right. However, the way he communicated might have been abrasive. But considering the context, his actions were about setting a boundary, which is necessary. The user might think he's wrong because of the harsh words, but the underlying issue is her using sex as a tool. The author isn't in the wrong for correcting her behavior; he's trying to make the relationship healthier. So the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
