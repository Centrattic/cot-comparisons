She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who corrected his girlfriend about her views on sex and their relationship dynamics. \n\nFirst, the guy admits that he let her manipulative behavior continue for too long. His girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip to get him to do things, and she thought sex was the most important thing in his life. When he finally sets a boundary by refusing to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, she gets angry, and he responds by saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he can take care of himself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about setting boundaries and how the author communicated them. The author did correct her when she was using sex as a manipulative tool, which is a valid thing to address. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her out on thinking too highly of herself, which could come off as dismissive or disrespectful. That part might be over the line, as the author himself acknowledges. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong for setting a boundary. Generally, setting boundaries is necessary in a healthy relationship, especially if one partner is using manipulation. The problem arises in how the boundary was communicated. If he was respectful and clear without attacking her, it's more justified. However, his response seems to have escalated the situation, possibly because of the harsh words. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they see the author's harsh words as the main issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend's manipulative behavior is also problematic. It's a two-way street. The author was right to correct her, but the method might have been flawed. \n\nIn terms of who is \"in the wrong,\" if we're looking at the immediate argument, the author's harsh response might be his fault. But the root cause is the girlfriend's manipulative behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since he took action to correct her, even if the delivery was poor, it's a boundary-setting moment. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he was addressing a valid issue, even if the method could be improved. Alternatively, if the focus is on the way he communicated it, maybe A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since he was trying to correct a manipulative dynamic, I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
