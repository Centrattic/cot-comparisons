She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her view on sex and setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, which the author mentions she does a lot. He says she uses it to get him to do things he doesn't want. So, he's correcting her by saying sex isn't the most important thing and he can turn down her requests. \n\nHe did say he's partly at fault for letting it go on too long. But now he's setting a boundary, which is important. The argument happened when he refused her request to work at her mom's house. He explained his reasoning, but then maybe went too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself. That part might be harsh, but he's defending himself against her manipulation.\n\nSo, the main points are about setting boundaries and correcting her manipulation. The author is trying to communicate that he's not okay with being pressured. While the harsh comment might be an issue, the overall act of setting a boundary is valid. So, the answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
