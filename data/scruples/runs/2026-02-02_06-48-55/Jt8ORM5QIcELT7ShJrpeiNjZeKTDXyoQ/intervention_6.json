She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author finally stands up for himself by refusing to work at her mom's house on his day off, leading to an argument where he says some harsh things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and potentially unhealthy. The author has been letting this go because the sex is good, but now he's setting a boundary. Setting boundaries is generally a positive thing, so maybe he's not in the wrong there. However, he did say that she thinks too highly of herself, which might come off as dismissive or hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the girlfriend was pressuring him into activities he didn't want to do, the author has a right to refuse. However, the way he communicated his refusal might have been harsh. The question is whether correcting the record (i.e., stating that sex isn't the end-all-be-all) is wrong. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel respected and heard. The author's frustration is valid if he's been putting up with manipulative behavior. But his response might have been too confrontational. The user who commented thinks the author is in the wrong, which could be because they believe he should have handled it more delicately. \n\nHowever, if the girlfriend was using sex as a tool for control, the author is justified in asserting his boundaries. The issue is whether his correction was necessary and how he delivered it. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about communication in relationships. \n\nIn summary, while the author's tone might have been harsh, his actions stem from a valid need to set boundaries after being manipulated. So the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong), but some might argue for A if they believe the approach was too aggressive. However, considering the context of ongoing manipulation, the author's correction is a reasonable response.\n"
