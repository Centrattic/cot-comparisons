She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether they should correct the record about sex with their girlfriend leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend had some \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. They felt they let it go too long. Then, the girlfriend asked them to work at her mom's house on their only day off, with the promise of sex. The author was too tired and refused, which upset her. The author then had to explain that sex isn't the end-all and that they could take care of themselves, which the author admits might have been over the line.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend is using sex as a way to get things done, which the author finds manipulative. The author is correcting the record by asserting that sex isn't the only thing they want. However, the author did refuse a request, which the girlfriend was upset about. The author also used harsh words, saying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself, which the author admits crossed a line.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to set a boundary by refusing to work on their day off, which is their right. However, the way they communicated it, especially the part about taking care of themselves, could be hurtful. The girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and unhealthy. The author is standing up for their needs, which is important, but the method might have been harsh.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they corrected the record about sex not being the only priority, which is valid. However, the way they did it, especially the last comment, might have been hurtful. But the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulation. The author is not entirely in the wrong because they're asserting their boundaries, even if the delivery could be improved. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
