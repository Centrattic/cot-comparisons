She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the guy is correcting his girlfriend's views on sex. The girlfriend thinks sex is the most important thing and uses it as a way to get him to do things. The guy finally says no to her request because he's too tired, and during the argument, he told her she thinks too highly of herself. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the power dynamics here. The girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which can be a form of manipulation. That's a red flag in a relationship. The guy has been going along with it because he enjoys the sex, which could be enabling her behavior. He took the day off, which is his personal time, and he's entitled to rest. Refusing to spend that time on her mother's house is his right. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh, especially saying she thinks too highly of herself. That could come off as dismissive or rude. But the core issue is that she's manipulating him with sex, which is problematic. The guy is asserting his boundaries, which is a healthy thing, but the manner in which he did it might have been hurtful. So, is he wrong? Well, setting boundaries is not wrong, but the tone and the specific comment might be. But overall, the main issue is her manipulative behavior. The guy's correction is justified, even if the delivery was a bit harsh. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
