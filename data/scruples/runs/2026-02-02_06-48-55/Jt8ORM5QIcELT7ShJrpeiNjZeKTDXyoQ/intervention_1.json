Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex and setting a boundary. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend has \"silly ideas about men and sex,\" thinking it's the most important thing and using it as a \"get out of jail free card.\" She also uses sex to convince him to do things he doesn't want to do. The guy admits he's at fault for letting this continue, as he usually goes along because the sex is great. \n\nThen, in the recent incident, she asked him to work at her mom's house on his only day off, promising good sex in return. He says he's too tired and wants to relax, turning her down. She gets angry, and he has to explain that sex isn't the end-all. The conversation gets heated, and he tells her she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits might be over the line.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The guy is asserting his right to set boundaries and correct her manipulative behavior. He's tired and wants rest, which is valid. However, his response might have been harsh, especially calling her self-centered. But he did admit that he went along before, which contributed to her using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nThe key here is whether correcting her and setting a boundary is wrong. In healthy relationships, communication and boundaries are important. The guy is trying to address an imbalance. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh, but the act of setting a boundary itself is reasonable. \n\nHe acknowledges his part in letting it go on, which shows self-awareness. The user thinks he's wrong, but maybe the question is about whether his actions were wrong. Since he's trying to correct a manipulative pattern and set a boundary, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The harsh comment could be a separate issue, but the main act of asserting himself is justified. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
