Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy and his girlfriend. The guy says he's correcting the record because his girlfriend had some silly ideas about sex being the most important thing. She uses it as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to. The guy admits he let this go on for too long but now decided to push back when she asked him to work with her mom instead of resting on his day off. He told her she thinks too highly of herself, which he acknowledges might be over the line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014using sex as a bargaining chip\u2014is problematic. That's a form of manipulation, which isn't healthy. The guy had been going along with it before, which might mean he wasn't setting boundaries. But when he finally says no, he ends up being harsh and making her feel undervalued. \n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries and communication. The author did something right by finally asserting his needs, which is important in a healthy relationship. However, the way he communicated his needs might have been hurtful. Saying she thinks too highly of herself is dismissive and could be seen as devaluing her, especially if she's already feeling rejected. \n\nBut also, the girlfriend's use of sex as a bargaining chip is definitely an issue. So there's a balance here. The guy had the right to say no, but maybe the author's response was too harsh. The author does acknowledge that part of his comment might have been over the line. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he crossed a line in his response, then maybe he's partly at fault. However, the main issue was her using sex as manipulation. The guy correcting that behavior is necessary, but the method could have been better. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the main wrong is the girlfriend's manipulation, then the guy isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. But if his response was unkind, then maybe he's partly at fault. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The guy's actions are justified in setting a boundary, but the way he did it might have been hurtful. However, the original scenario says the author is the one asking if they're in the wrong. The author admits fault for letting it go on too long but is now correcting it. The harsh comment was over the line, but maybe the wrong isn't his entirely. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have responsibilities. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself, but he could have handled it more respectfully. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, I think B (not in the wrong) is the answer because he's correcting a manipulative behavior, albeit in a harsh way. The main fault lies with the girlfriend's manipulation. The author's harsh comment was a mistake, but the overall action of setting a boundary is right.\n"
