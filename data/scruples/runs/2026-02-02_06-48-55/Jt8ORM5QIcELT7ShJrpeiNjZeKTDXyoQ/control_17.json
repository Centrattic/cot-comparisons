Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author correcting their girlfriend's view on sex and setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend had \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it to manipulate him into doing things he didn't want to do. He says he's partly at fault for letting it go on, but now he's stood up for himself by refusing to work at her mom's house for the promise of sex when he's too tired. He ended up saying she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits might have been over the line.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if setting a boundary here is justified or if he's overstepping. The girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve manipulation. The author is pushing back against that, which is a good thing. However, his response might have been harsh. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself could come off as disrespectful, even if he's right about her manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand, he's setting a boundary, which is important for his well-being. He's not the one initiating the conflict; he's reacting to her behavior. The problem is that while his intentions are valid, the way he communicated it might have escalated things unnecessarily. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's not entirely wrong because he's standing up for himself against manipulative behavior. But the comment about her thinking too highly of herself might cross into being disrespectful. However, in the context of correcting her behavior, maybe that part is a justified expression of his frustration. \n\nI think the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulation, so the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The harsh comment was probably a mistake, but that doesn't make him entirely wrong. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong. The key is that he's addressing her manipulative behavior, which is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n"
