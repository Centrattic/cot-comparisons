She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author correcting their girlfriend about her views on sex. The girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, and the author finally pushes back after being taken advantage of.\n\nFirst, the author admits they let things go on too long. They allowed their GF to manipulate them with sex because it was great, but now they're setting a boundary. The GF expected a trade where work for her mom in exchange for sex, but the author was too tired. The argument escalated, and the author said something hurtful to make a point.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to analyze. The GF's behavior is manipulative, using sex as a bargaining chip. That's not healthy. The author tried to correct her, which is a good step, but maybe the way they did it was harsh. Saying they could take care of themselves and that she thinks too highly of herself might have been crossing a line.\n\nBut wait, the author was setting a boundary. If someone is being manipulated, standing up for oneself is important. However, the method of communication matters. The author could have been more respectful. But the GF's behavior is the root issue here. The author's frustration is valid because they were being used. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They had a right to set a boundary, but the harsh words were inappropriate. However, given the context of ongoing manipulation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the GF's behavior is manipulative. On the other, the author's response could have been better. But overall, the author was trying to correct an unfair dynamic. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They had valid reasons to push back against being manipulated.\n"
