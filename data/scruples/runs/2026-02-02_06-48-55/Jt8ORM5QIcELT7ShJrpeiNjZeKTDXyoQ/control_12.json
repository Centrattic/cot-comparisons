She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author's girlfriend (gf) uses sex as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author finally sets a boundary by turning her down and explains that while sex is great, it's not the most important thing. But he went a bit far by saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The gf is using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative and unhealthy. The author had been letting this go for a while because he enjoys the sex. Now he's pushing back, which is a positive step in setting boundaries. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He admitted that his comment was probably over the line, but he felt it was necessary because of her frequent use of this tactic.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is trying to correct the record about his priorities, which is important for mutual respect. However, using a confrontational approach during an argument might not be the best way. It could escalate things. But considering that the gf had been using manipulation, the author's pushback is justified. He's not wrong for setting boundaries, even if the delivery was a bit harsh. The main issue is the manipulation, and the author is right to address it, even if the method isn't perfect. So the answer would be that he's not in the wrong (B). The key points are about unhealthy dynamics and the necessity of setting boundaries, even if the execution could be better.\n"
