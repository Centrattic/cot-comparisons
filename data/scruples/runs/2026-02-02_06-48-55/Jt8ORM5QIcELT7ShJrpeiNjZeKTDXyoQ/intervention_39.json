She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip and the author correcting her record.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend had \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it to get him to do things. He admits he let it go on too long because the sex is great and he went along with it. Then, when he declined her request to work at her mom's house because he's tired, he had to explain that sex isn't the end-all-be-all. He ended up saying she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits might be over the line.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip is a red flag. Manipulation through sex is not healthy, and the author is right to point that out. However, the way he responded might have been harsh. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself could be hurtful, even if his point is valid. But the user also says he corrected the record, which is about setting boundaries. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was wrong to set boundaries. If the girlfriend is using sex to manipulate, it's important for the author to assert his needs. However, the method of communication matters. While the message might be justified, the delivery could be problematic. But the scenario mentions that the author admitted to letting it go on too long, so correcting her now is necessary. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong for standing up for himself, especially if the girlfriend's behavior was manipulative. However, the harshness of his response could have been an issue. But overall, the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulation, so the author might not be entirely at fault. So the answer could be B, not in the wrong.\n"
