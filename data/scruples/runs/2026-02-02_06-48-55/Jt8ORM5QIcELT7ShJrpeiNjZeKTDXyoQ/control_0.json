Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who corrected his girlfriend about her views on sex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy says his girlfriend had \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. He admits he let it go on too long because he enjoyed the sex. Then, he refused her request to work at her mom's house, which led to an argument. He told her that sex isn't everything and that she thinks too highly of herself.\n\nSo, the main points are: she's using sex to get him to do things, he finally sets a boundary, and the argument escalates. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, she might feel disrespected if he's correcting her views and implying she's overvalued. Using sex as a bargaining chip isn't healthy, but he's now pushing back. On the other hand, she might have felt that he was being selfish when he turned her down. But he's setting a boundary, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n\nHe also said he's at fault for letting it go on, which shows he acknowledges his part. The argument got heated, and he made a harsh comment about her thinking too highly of herself, which might be the part where he went too far. But the core issue is about mutual respect and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and respect each other's needs. If she was using sex as a manipulative tool, he's right to correct that. However, the way he communicated it (calling her self-centered) might have been hurtful. So, maybe part of the blame is on him for the harsh words, but the overall act of setting a boundary isn't wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: He's not entirely in the wrong for standing up for his needs, but he could have handled the confrontation better. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries, but there's a nuance here. However, the key is that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is about the boundary setting. So the answer is B.\n"
