Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who corrected his girlfriend about her views on sex. He mentions she thought sex was the most important thing in his life and used it to manipulate him into doing things. He normally gave in because the sex is great, but this time he said no because he was tired and wanted to rest. Things got heated, and he told her she thought too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which he admits might have been over the line.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author acknowledges that he let things go on too long. That shows some self-awareness. He's trying to correct her behavior, which he sees as manipulative. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. \n\nWhen the author turned down her request for the day off, was that justified? He was tired and wanted to relax, which is valid. People have the right to set boundaries and prioritize their own needs. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He says things like \"she thinks too highly of herself\" and mentions that she uses sex as a bargaining chip. That could come off as dismissive or disrespectful, even if he felt she was manipulative.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is anger, which might stem from feeling rejected or devalued. The author's response, while trying to set a boundary, might have been harsh. Even if he's right about her using sex as leverage, the way he confronts her could escalate the conflict. It's possible he overstepped by being condescending, which could hurt her feelings or make her feel unappreciated.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to correct a pattern where he felt used. Setting boundaries is important in a healthy relationship. If she's manipulative, it's reasonable to push back. But the tone and choice of words matter. The line he crossed might be in the delivery rather than the act of setting a boundary itself.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If the author is trying to correct her behavior and he's being honest about his needs, that's good. But if the way he communicated his needs was disrespectful or hurtful, then he's at least partially at fault. The fact that he acknowledges that his comment might have been over the line suggests he recognizes some fault. However, the core issue is about mutual respect in their dynamic. If she's using sex as a bargaining chip, that's her issue, but his response should be measured.\n\nIn conclusion, he's not entirely wrong for setting a boundary, but the way he handled the situation could have been more respectful. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the understanding that his communication could improve.\n"
