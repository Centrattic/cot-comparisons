She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy correcting his girlfriend's views on sex. He says she treats sex as a way to get him to do things and thought it was the most important thing. He finally said no because he was tired and wanted to relax. He told her that sex isn't the end-all and that he could take care of himself if needed. She got angry, and he admitted that part might have been over the line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is taking a stand, setting boundaries. He's saying no to something he doesn't want to do, which is a healthy thing. But he also made a comment that he could take care of himself, which the girlfriend took as her thinking too highly of herself. That might come off as dismissive or belittling.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip is a red flag. That's not a healthy dynamic. The guy has the right to set boundaries, especially if he's been letting it go too long. But how he communicated that might be an issue. The part where he said she thinks too highly of herself could be hurtful and might imply that he's not interested in her in a way that's important. \n\nIs it wrong for him to set boundaries? Probably not. People should be able to say no. But the way he phrased it might have been harsh. The key here is whether the correction was respectful. If he's been going along with her demands because he didn't want to upset her, that's not healthy either. So he's trying to correct the dynamic, which is necessary.\n\nBut the comment about her thinking too highly of herself could be seen as blaming her and not taking responsibility for his own actions. Instead of saying she uses sex as a bargaining chip, maybe he could have expressed his feelings without attacking her. However, the situation is complex. He's in a relationship where he's been complying, and now he's trying to correct that. The main issue is whether setting boundaries is wrong. I think it's not. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's taking a necessary step, even if the delivery could be better. The question is about being in the wrong, not about the communication style. So the answer is B.\n"
