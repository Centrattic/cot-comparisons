She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who corrected his girlfriend about her views on sex and refused her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, the guy admits that he let her manipulative behavior continue for too long. He acknowledges that she uses sex as a bargaining chip, which is a red flag. Now, he stood up for himself by saying no when he was too exhausted. But he went a bit too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which might have been harsh.\n\nOn one hand, setting boundaries is important in a healthy relationship. It's okay to say no, especially when you're not in the mood or need rest. He's taking responsibility for not addressing the issue earlier, which is good. On the other hand, the way he communicated his refusal might have been hurtful. Insulting her self-esteem could be seen as crossing a line, even if she's been using sex as a manipulative tool.\n\nBut the core issue is about mutual respect. If she's been using sex as a bargaining chip, that's her fault. He's correcting the record to assert his own needs, which is necessary for a balanced relationship. However, the way he delivered it might have been unkind. The key is whether his actions were in self-defense against her manipulation. Since he's trying to establish healthier boundaries, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the harsh comments could have been avoided. So, maybe he's partly right and partly wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might balance both aspects, but since he's taking responsibility for letting it go on and is trying to correct her behavior, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But the harsh comment does make him part of the problem. Hmm.\n"
