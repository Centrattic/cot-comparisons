She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy and his girlfriend. The guy says she has silly ideas about sex, thinking it's the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip to get him to do things he doesn't want. He admits he let this go on too long because the sex is great. Then, when she asks him to work at her mom's house on his only day off in exchange for sex, he says no because he's tired and wants to relax. She gets angry, and he explains that sex isn't the end all be all. Then he goes a bit too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which she takes as over the line.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is using sex as a tool to manipulate him. That's not healthy. The author says he let it go on too long, so maybe he's partly responsible for not addressing it earlier. But when he finally stands up for himself, he ends up being harsh. \n\nIs correcting the record about sex a valid reason? If she's using it as a bargaining chip, that's a form of manipulation. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is important in a relationship. But his response was a bit aggressive. Saying she thinks too highly of herself and implying he could just take care of himself might come off as dismissive or belittling. \n\nHealthy communication is key. Instead of lashing out, he could have said no without attacking her. But the main issue is her using sex as a way to control him. The author is trying to correct that dynamic. However, the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the problem is the manipulation, he's right to address it. But the method could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is correcting a harmful behavior, even if his delivery is harsh, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the line about taking care of himself and her ego might be the wrong approach. \n\nI think it's a mix. He's right to set boundaries, but the way he did it was problematic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user says they think he is, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for himself against manipulation. But the harsh words could tip it. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is the manipulation, he's right to correct it. So overall, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, in the context of the question, the author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to correct an unhealthy dynamic, even if his approach was flawed.\n"
