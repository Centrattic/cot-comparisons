She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex and setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that his girlfriend had some \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. He admits he let it go on too long. The key event is when he turned down her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, which he's been doing before. He explains that he's tired and wants to relax instead. The argument escalated, and he said some things that might have gone too far, like implying she thinks too highly of herself.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if his actions were wrong. Let's break it down. Setting boundaries is generally healthy in a relationship. If she was using sex to manipulate him into doing things he didn't want to do, that's a red flag. He's trying to correct her behavior, which could be necessary for a balanced relationship. However, the way he handled the rejection might be an issue. He admitted saying something over the line, which could have been hurtful. \n\nBut was he in the wrong for asserting his needs? If she was pressuring him, he has a right to say no. The fact that he's willing to admit he let it go on too long shows self-awareness. The main question is whether correcting her and setting a boundary is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he's been passive before and now decided to speak up, that's a positive step. However, the confrontation might have been too harsh. But the core issue is her using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative. He's trying to address that, which is the right thing to do. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they focus on the argument part. But overall, standing up for oneself in an unhealthy dynamic isn't wrong.\n"
