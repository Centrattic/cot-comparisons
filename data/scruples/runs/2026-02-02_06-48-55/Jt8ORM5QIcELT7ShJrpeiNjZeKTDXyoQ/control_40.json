She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex.\n\nFirst, the girl thinks sex is the most important thing and uses it to get him to do stuff. The guy admits he let it go on too long because the sex is great. But now he's tired and refuses her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. He tells her it's not the end all, which leads to an argument. He even says she thinks too highly of herself, which might be harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong. Let's break it down. The guy is finally setting a boundary after letting things go. He's honest about his needs, which is good. The girl was using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative. The guy's right to correct that. But did he go too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself? That might have been harsh, but maybe necessary if she's been manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy should have communicated better earlier instead of letting it build up. But he's taking responsibility for that. Now, when he's exhausted, he's standing up for himself. He's also acknowledging that his comment might have been over the line, but justifying it because of her manipulative behavior.\n\nI think the main point is about setting boundaries. The guy is not in the wrong for correcting her manipulative behavior. The anger from the girl might be because her tactics were exposed. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
