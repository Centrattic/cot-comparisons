She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend (gf) has some views about sex being super important, using it as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author admits he let it go on too long and that sex is great, so he went along. But last time, he was really tired and turned her down. He explained that sex is great but not everything, and he needed to relax. Things escalated, and he told her she thinks too highly of herself, which he now thinks might have been over the line. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's gf was using sex as a bargaining chip. That's a manipulative tactic, right? So the author tried to set a boundary here. He was tired and needed rest instead of working. The problem is, he used hurtful words, like saying she thinks too highly of herself. That could be harsh and hurt her feelings, even if he felt she was manipulating him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a position where he had to say no to something he wasn't comfortable with, which is important for healthy relationships. He did communicate his feelings, but maybe the way he did it was not the best. The key here is whether he crossed a line that was unnecessary. He acknowledges that part might have been over the line, but is he in the wrong overall?\n\nThe original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but the answer might depend on the balance between setting boundaries and the method used. The author had a right to say no, but the way he did it might have been too harsh. However, since the gf was using sex as a manipulation tool, maybe the author was justified in pushing back. But the comment about her thinking highly of herself could be seen as dismissive or belittling.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author was right to set a boundary, but his response might have been inappropriate. However, the main issue is the manipulation from the gf. The author's actions were a reaction to her behavior. In terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't the sole one at fault. The question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then it's because he was disrespectful. If B (no), then because he stood up for himself against manipulation.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he was asserting his needs after a pattern of manipulation. But his choice of words was poor. However, the core issue is her using sex as a bargaining chip, so he wasn't wrong to push back. The answer might be B.\n"
