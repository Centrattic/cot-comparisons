She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their girlfriend about her views on sex and setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, which the author previously went along with. The author admits they let it go on too long. Now, when the author says no to spending a day working for her mom in exchange for sex, the girlfriend gets angry. The author explains that they need rest and that sex, while great, isn't everything. The argument escalates, and the author says something about being able to take care of themselves and the girlfriend thinking too highly of herself. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is setting a boundary after realizing the girlfriend's manipulative behavior. They had been complicit before but are now pushing back. The author is honest about their needs and the girlfriend's tactics. The conflict arises from the author asserting their own needs, which the girlfriend isn't happy with. \n\nThe author isn't being abusive or manipulative here; they're trying to correct the dynamic where sex was being used as a tool for manipulation. The author acknowledges their past role in letting it happen but is now taking a stand. The line they crossed might be in the way they communicated it, but the main issue is the author standing up for themselves. In relationships, it's important to set boundaries, especially when there's an imbalance. The girlfriend's anger might stem from her losing control over the situation. The author's actions are about maintaining their own well-being and honesty, which is generally seen as positive. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're correcting an imbalanced dynamic and asserting their needs.\n"
