She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex. From the description, the girlfriend seems to treat sex as a way to manipulate him into doing things, and the guy finally pushes back when she asks him to work on his day off in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy says that he's at fault for letting it go on too long because he gave in before. But now he's setting a boundary by refusing, which is understandable. He's tired and wants to relax. The issue is whether his response was appropriate. He said that sex is great but not everything, which is a reasonable point. However, he also said that he could take care of himself and that she thinks too highly of herself, which might have been harsh. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is a problem. It's not healthy if she's using it to get him to do things he doesn't want. The guy has the right to set boundaries, but the way he communicated it might have been rude. However, the core issue is her manipulation. If he's correcting the record to stop her from using sex as a tool, that's valid. But he might have handled it more respectfully.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's just setting a boundary, maybe not. But his harsh words could be seen as hurtful. However, his main point is about correcting her misperception, which is justified. The answer might hinge on whether his actions were necessary to address her manipulative behavior. Since he's trying to establish that sex isn't a bargaining chip, and he's tired of it, he's not entirely at fault. The key is that both need to work on communication, but in this situation, the guy is defending against her manipulation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he could have been more respectful in his delivery. The main issue is her behavior, and he's trying to correct it, which is understandable.\n"
