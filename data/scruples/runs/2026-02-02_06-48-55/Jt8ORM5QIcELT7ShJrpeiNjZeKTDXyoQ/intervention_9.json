She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has some ideas that sex is the most important thing and uses it to persuade him to do things he doesn't want. The author admits he let this go on for too long because he enjoys the sex. Now, when she asks him to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, he turns her down because he's tired and wants rest. He explains that sex isn't everything and that he'd rather not work and relax. The argument gets heated, and he says some harsh things about her thinking too highly of herself.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let's break it down. The girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative. The author tried to correct her, which he admits might have gone too far. He's right that she's been using it as a tool, but his response might have been harsh. He mentions that he's at fault for letting it continue, which is a good self-awareness point.\n\nIs it wrong to set boundaries? Probably not. The author is finally standing up for his needs, which he should do in a healthy relationship. However, the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. Saying she thinks too highly of herself could be dismissive. But considering her manipulative behavior, maybe he had valid reasons to push back. \n\nSo, the key points: using sex as a bargaining chip is problematic, the author had a right to set a boundary, but the way he did it might have been harsh. But setting a boundary isn't wrong in itself. The question is if he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because he's asserting his needs, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
