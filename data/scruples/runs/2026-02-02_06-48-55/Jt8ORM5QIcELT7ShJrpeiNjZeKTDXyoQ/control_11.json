Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend's view that sex is the most important thing and using it to manipulate him. He finally says no when she wants him to work on her mom's house in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, the guy admits he's partly at fault for letting things go on too long. He acknowledges that he went along with her demands before because he enjoyed the sex. So he's aware of his own role in the dynamic. Now, he turned her down because he was too tired, and this led to a conflict. He ended up saying some harsh things, like she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself, which he admits might have been over the line.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual respect in a relationship. Using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and not healthy. The guy is correcting her behavior, which is a positive step. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. He says things that could come off as dismissive or hurtful, even if his intention was to set a boundary. \n\nBut considering that she was using sex as a way to get him to do things he didn't want to do, his correction is about establishing that sex isn't a tool for manipulation. The fact that he's now setting boundaries is important. The main issue is whether his response was appropriate. He admits he went too far in his response, but the core issue lies in her using sex manipulatively. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual respect and not use personal boundaries or physical intimacy as leverage. The author is taking a stand against that, which is right. However, the method he used to correct her might not have been the best. But the core issue is her behavior, not his correction. So, the answer depends on whether the correction itself is in the wrong. Since he's standing up for himself and addressing her manipulative behavior, he's not in the wrong for that. The problem is more about how he communicated it, but the main wrongdoing was hers in using sex that way.\n"
