She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who uses sex as a bargaining chip to get her way, and the author finally corrected her, leading to a heated argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author admits that they let the situation continue for too long because they enjoyed the sex and went along with her demands. This suggests that the author might have enabled the behavior by not setting boundaries earlier. When they finally said no, it led to conflict. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and respect. The author's approach was to correct her in the moment during an argument, which might have been harsh. They admitted that their response (saying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself) was over the line. That's a clear indication that the author's communication was inappropriate, even if they felt justified.\n\nHowever, the author also points out that the girlfriend was using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative and unhealthy. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship, so refusing to comply isn't inherently wrong. But the way they communicated their refusal was confrontational and possibly hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. They did take responsibility for letting things go on too long, which shows some self-awareness. On the other hand, their response during the argument was crossing a line by belittling the girlfriend. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to address manipulative behaviors without being confrontational. The author might have been right to set a boundary, but the method could have been more constructive. So, while the intention to correct the behavior isn't entirely wrong, the approach was flawed. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is partially at fault for how they handled the situation, but not entirely wrong for setting a boundary. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the boundary-setting or the communication method. Since the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that their harsh words were over the line despite their valid concerns, the answer leans towards A (Yes).\n"
