She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. The situation involves the author setting a boundary by refusing to work at his girlfriend's mom's house in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had previously used sex as a way to persuade him to do things he didn't want to do. The author admits he let this continue for too long but now, after being tired, he says no. He explains that sex is great but not the end-all. He also told her she thinks too highly of herself, which he acknowledges might be over the line.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider communication and mutual respect. The author was setting a boundary, which is healthy. However, the way he communicated it by saying she thinks too highly of herself could be hurtful. Using sarcasm or belittling language, even if it's a reaction to her previous behavior, can escalate conflicts. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative, but the author's response, while trying to correct her, might have been harsh. Setting boundaries is right, but the method matters. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. He did explain his reasoning, but the comment about her self-image could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should respect each other's needs. The author was right to say no, but the way he did it might have been inconsiderate. So, balancing both sides: he's not wrong for saying no, but his choice of words might be. But the main question is if he's in the wrong overall. Since he's asserting his needs and correcting her manipulative behavior, even if his phrasing was harsh, the core action of setting a boundary isn't wrong. So, the answer might be B.\n"
