She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person correcting their girlfriend about the importance of sex in their relationship. The user is asking whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that their girlfriend has some \"silly ideas about men and sex,\" thinking it's the most important thing and a \"get out of jail free card.\" The author admits they've let this go for too long. The key incident here is when the girlfriend asked the author to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. The author, exhausted, refused and ended up explaining that sex isn't everything. The conversation got heated, and the author said some things that might have been harsh, like implying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is taking responsibility for allowing the situation to persist by not setting boundaries earlier. They also acknowledge that the sex is great but that the girlfriend uses it as a bargaining chip. The author's actions were to set a boundary this time, which is understandable because they were tired and didn't want to comply. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author was asserting their own needs, which is a valid thing to do. However, the way they communicated it might have been hurtful. Saying that the girlfriend \"thinks too highly of herself\" could be perceived as dismissive or disrespectful, especially if it's a pattern. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong for correcting the record. They were standing up for themselves after letting things go for too long. While the method might have been harsh, the act of setting a boundary is not inherently wrong. The girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is also problematic, which the author is now addressing.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for correcting the situation, but their approach could have been more considerate. However, the core of the question is whether they're in the wrong for correcting the record. Since setting boundaries is important, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, given the options, the author's action, despite some harshness, is about asserting self-respect, which is a valid stance. So the answer is B.\n"
