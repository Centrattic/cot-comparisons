She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy correcting the record about sex with his girlfriend. The main issue seems to be that the girlfriend uses sex as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to do, like working at her mom's house. The guy finally says no because he's tired and wants to rest. He tells her that sex is great but not everything, and he even says that she thinks too highly of herself. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are being dismissed when he refuses her offer. But the guy is also setting a boundary, which is important in a healthy relationship. Using sex as a bargaining chip isn't healthy, right? That's called transactional sex, which can create power imbalances. The guy has a right to say no and prioritize his own needs.\n\nHowever, the way he communicated his refusal might have been harsh. He mentions that he said she thinks too highly of herself, which could be hurtful. Even if she's been manipulative, the way he responds matters. Healthy communication involves expressing needs without belittling the other person. So maybe the guy was right to set boundaries but handled it poorly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're looking at the fact that he corrected her in a harsh way. But also, the girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is problematic. The guy is trying to correct that dynamic. So is he wrong for defending his own needs? Probably not. But the way he phrased it might have been an issue. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The guy has the right to refuse without being disrespectful. Since he acknowledged that he let it go on too long, maybe he's trying to change the dynamic. The key here is whether using sex as a bargaining chip is his fault or hers. If she's manipulating, he's not wrong to stop. However, communication style is a factor. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but he could improve how he handles it.\n"
