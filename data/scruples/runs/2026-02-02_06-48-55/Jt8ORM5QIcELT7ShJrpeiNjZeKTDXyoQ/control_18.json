Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. The background is that the girlfriend has some beliefs that sex is the most important thing and uses it as a bargaining chip. The user says they're partly at fault for letting it go on, but now they turned down her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. They got into an argument, and the user said some things that the girlfriend found over the line, like saying she thinks too highly of herself.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend uses sex as a \"get out of jail free card\" and a way to persuade the user into doing things they don't want to do. The user is now pushing back, which led to a conflict. The user is self-aware, admitting they let it go on too long because they enjoyed the sex. Now they're setting boundaries, which is understandable. But the user also said something harsh that crossed a line, according to the girlfriend.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the user in the wrong for standing up for themselves and setting boundaries, even if it meant being confrontational? Or is the girlfriend the one in the wrong for using sex as a tool for manipulation?\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If one partner is consistently using sex to manipulate the other, that's a problem. The user is finally asserting their needs, which is healthy. However, the way they communicated it\u2014calling the girlfriend over the top\u2014might have been hurtful. But the underlying issue is the girlfriend's manipulative behavior. The user is addressing that, even if their delivery was harsh. \n\nThe user isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They should have expressed their needs without belittling the girlfriend, but the core issue is the girlfriend's behavior. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the user is correcting a manipulative dynamic, even if their phrasing was harsh. The girlfriend's actions were the root problem.\n"
