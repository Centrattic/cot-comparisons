She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend has some \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing in his life and using it as a bargaining chip. He admits he let this go on for too long because the sex is great. Now, he refused to spend his day off working at her mom's house, which she had promised would lead to good sex. He explained that sex is awesome but not the end-all, and he'd rather relax. The argument escalated, and he told her she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits might be over the line.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girlfriend is using sex as a manipulative tool to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author, after allowing this for a while, finally sets a boundary by refusing. However, his response was confrontational and possibly hurtful.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, setting boundaries is generally healthy. If she's using sex to manipulate, he's right to correct that. But his method might be problematic. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself could be dismissive or invalidating. Maybe he should have handled it with more empathy. However, the main issue is her manipulative behavior, so his correction is justified. The user initially thought the author was wrong but maybe the key is in how he communicated it. But the problem is her use of sex as a bargaining chip, which is the core issue. The author's action in this case was standing up for himself, even if the delivery could be improved. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication style. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong at all. Since he's correcting manipulative behavior, even if the approach was harsh, it's a valid boundary. So likely answer B.\n"
