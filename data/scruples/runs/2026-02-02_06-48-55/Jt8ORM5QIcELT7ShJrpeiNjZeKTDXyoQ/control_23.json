Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip and the writer correcting her by turning down an offer to work for her mom in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, the writer mentions that their girlfriend has what they consider \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and a \"get out of jail free card.\" They admit they let this go on for too long because the sex is great. Now, the girlfriend asked them to work on their day off, promising good sex, but the writer was too tired and said no. This led to an argument where the writer had to explain that sex isn't everything and that they needed to rest. The writer also said some harsh things, like the girl thinks too highly of herself, which might have been over the line.\n\nSo, the key points here are: using sex as a bargaining chip, the writer setting a boundary by refusing the request, and the argument that followed. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for correcting the record.\n\nOn one hand, using sex as a bargaining chip can be manipulative and unhealthy. The writer is right to set a boundary here by refusing to work when they're exhausted. They are also pointing out the imbalance in their partner's approach. But on the other hand, the way they responded might have come off as harsh, especially the comment about their partner thinking too highly of themselves. However, the main issue is whether the refusal itself is wrong. Since the writer was honest about their needs and corrected the misconception that sex is a motivator for them, they might not be in the wrong. The problem seems to stem from the partner's manipulative behavior rather than the writer's refusal. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no other angle I'm missing. The writer did admit to letting it go on too long, which means they took responsibility for that part. The refusal was justified because they were beat. So overall, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
