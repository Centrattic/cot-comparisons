She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend uses sex as a way to manipulate him into doing things he doesn't want to do, like working at her mom's house. He's been going along with this because the sex is good, but he finally says no when he's too tired. He explains that sex isn't the end-all and turns down her request. The argument escalates, and he says something about her thinking too highly of herself, which she takes as over the line.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which is a form of manipulation. The author is correcting her by setting a boundary. He acknowledges that he let it go on too long, taking some responsibility. However, when he says he could take care of himself and that she thinks too highly of herself, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is generally healthy in a relationship. If someone is using sex to manipulate, it's valid for the other person to push back. However, the way he communicated his boundary might have been harsh. The statement about her thinking too highly of herself could come off as dismissive or insulting, which might escalate the conflict. But the main issue is the manipulation, which the author is addressing. \n\nSo, while the author's approach might have been a bit harsh in delivery, the act of correcting her manipulation is justified. The key point is whether using sex as a bargaining chip is wrong. The author is trying to correct an unhealthy dynamic. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for setting a boundary, even if the way he did it could be improved. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
