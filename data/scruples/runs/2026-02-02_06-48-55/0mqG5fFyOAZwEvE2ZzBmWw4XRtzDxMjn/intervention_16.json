A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The story goes that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author, suspecting something, checked his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating, left a note, and then he yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that they had a valid reason to check because they sensed something was wrong. They mention that they're against snooping for no reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They justify their action by saying they saved themselves future heartbreak. On the other hand, the boyfriend claims that the snoop violated his privacy and that the cheating was a separate issue. \n\nNow, considering general ethical viewpoints. Privacy is a significant aspect in relationships. Trust is also crucial. By snooping, the author breached the trust by not communicating their concerns first. Even if there were suspicions, the method of checking the phone without consent might be seen as a violation. However, the outcome was that the cheating was confirmed, which might make people empathize with the author for uncovering the betrayal early.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the action was right or wrong in the context of a relationship. Many would argue that privacy should be respected, even in partnerships. The fact that the author didn't confront the issue directly first and instead chose to snoop might be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships require communication, and if there were concerns, discussing them openly would be the healthier approach. Also, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her a piece of shit\u2014shows that he felt deeply betrayed by her actions, not just his cheating. \n\nOn the flip side, the author could argue that they were self-protecting. Cheating is a major betrayal, and finding out early prevented ongoing emotional damage. However, the method of discovering it through snooping might still be considered a wrong action, even if the outcome was positive. \n\nDifferent cultures and individuals have varying views on privacy and trust. Some might see snooping as justified in cases of suspected infidelity, while others would see it as an overreach regardless of the outcome. \n\nI should also consider if there are any legal implications, but since this is a personal relationship question, it's more about moral judgment. Legally, privacy laws vary, but morally, the focus is on the relationship dynamics. \n\nOverall, while the author's intention was to uncover the truth, the method of doing so without consent and through surveillance is ethically questionable. The action itself, regardless of the result, might be considered a violation of trust and privacy. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong, but I need to make sure that the conclusion is well-reasoned.\n"
