A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and he mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, feeling a gut instinct something was wrong, checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, then he yelled at her for invading his privacy and not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that snooping was justified because she had a reason\u2014her boyfriend's behavior and the fear of being cheated on. She contrasts herself with friends who snoop out of nosiness without cause. She believes she saved herself future heartbreak.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Legally, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without consent is a violation, regardless of intent. Ethically, trust is a cornerstone in relationships. Even if the outcome was good (finding out about the infidelity), the act of snooping breaches trust. The boyfriend felt betrayed not just by the cheating but by the lack of trust. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that she was acting on suspicion and to protect herself. Some might argue that in cases of suspected betrayal, the ends justify the means. But others would say that trust should be maintained unless there's clear evidence, and that snooping is a breach of privacy that can damage the relationship regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe question is whether the action itself is wrong. From a relationship ethics perspective, trust is essential. If you don't trust your partner, the relationship might already be in trouble. So snooping might be seen as a choice that reflects underlying trust issues, which could be a problem regardless of the outcome.\n\nBut the author did leave the relationship after finding out, so maybe she's not maintaining a relationship built on distrust. However, the act of snooping still occurred. Different people have different views on privacy. Some might say that even if you suspect something, you should confront the person directly instead of checking their phone.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the community considers both the action and the intent. The author had a reason and felt justified. The boyfriend's reaction was anger over the privacy violation, not just the cheating. So the answer might depend on whether the community values privacy more than the justification for snooping.\n\nIn many similar cases, people might say that regardless of the outcome, snooping without consent is a breach of trust and privacy, making the author at fault. Others might empathize with her situation and see it as a necessary action to uncover the truth.\n\nI think the consensus here would be that the author is in the wrong because of the violation of privacy, even though the outcome was good. So answer A.\n"
