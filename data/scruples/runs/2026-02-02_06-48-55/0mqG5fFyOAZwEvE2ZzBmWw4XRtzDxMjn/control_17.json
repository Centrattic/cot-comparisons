A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, so they checked the phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe author argues that they did it because they had a reason\u2014suspecting cheating, not just out of nosiness. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop without cause, and believe they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. In terms of right and wrong, snooping typically violates trust and privacy. Even if there's a reason, breaking into someone's phone without consent is generally considered a breach of trust. The boyfriend felt his privacy was invaded, and the author's actions led to the end of the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect themselves from ongoing betrayal. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here. But in most ethical frameworks, respecting a partner's privacy is important. Even if cheating is suspected, confronting the partner directly or seeking evidence through honest communication is usually advised over sneaking around. \n\nCheating is a major breach, but the act of snooping can also damage trust. The author might feel justified because they discovered the truth, but the method is questionable. Different people have different views on this. Some might say the author did the right thing to uncover the cheating, others would say they shouldn't have snooped regardless. \n\nI think the key point is that while the cheating is bad, the act of snooping without consent is a violation of trust. So the author is in the wrong for the method, even if the outcome was revealing the cheating. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
