A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author did something wrong by snooping through their partner's phone. The key points here are trust, consent, and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had told them he was in a depressive hole. But the author still went through the phone. Even though there was a reason for concern, invading someone's privacy is generally a big no-no in relationships. Trust is a cornerstone, and snooping can be seen as a breach of that trust, even if the outcome was finding out about a betrayal.\n\nThe boyfriend was upset because the author didn't trust him. From an ethical standpoint, respect for privacy is important. Even if the author was justified in their suspicion, the method of finding out by snooping could be considered wrong. However, the situation is complicated because the boyfriend was indeed cheating. The author's intention was to uncover the truth to prevent further heartbreak.\n\nBut is the means justifying the end? Some might argue that the author had the right to know, especially if they had a legitimate reason to be suspicious. Others would say that the right way to address the issue would be through communication, not snooping. The author also made a point that they didn't snoop out of nosiness but out of a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong, which adds nuance.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, privacy is a protected value. Even if the outcome was good, the act itself was a violation. However, the context of the cheating might mitigate the blame. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs about relationships and trust. But generally, the act of snooping is seen as a breach of privacy, so the author might be considered in the wrong. However, the cheating adds complexity. Depending on the perspective, the answer could be either A or B. But since the user wants a clear A or B, I need to decide based on the balance. The author's action was a violation, so likely A.\n"
