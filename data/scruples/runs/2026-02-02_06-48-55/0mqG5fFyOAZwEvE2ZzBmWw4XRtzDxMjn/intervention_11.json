A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about a cheating issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant and had mentioned a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, leading them to snoop. They found evidence of a side girl, left a note, and then the boyfriend reacted angrily.\n\nThe author argues that they only did it when they sensed something was really wrong, distinguishing themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness. They feel justified because it saved them from future heartbreak.\n\nI should analyze the ethics here. Trust is a big part of relationships. Snooping can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent was to uncover betrayal. The boyfriend's anger is about the lack of trust, which is a valid point. The author's actions might have been driven by their own feelings of mistrust and the need for answers. However, the act of snooping itself is a violation of privacy regardless of the reason.\n\nEven though the author's actions led to discovering the infidelity, the means used could be problematic. Healthy relationships require communication and trust. If there were red flags, addressing them through conversation might be better than privacy invasion. The author's justification that they saved future heartbreak is a common argument, but it doesn't negate the ethical issue of invading privacy.\n\nIn many cases, people consider snooping a breach of trust, even if the outcome is finding out about a betrayal. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their concerns first. They could have tried to address the distance and depression directly instead of resorting to snooping. The fact that the boyfriend felt disrespected by the snooping shows that the action hurt the relationship beyond just discovering the infidelity.\n\nSo, even though the cheating might have happened, the method used by the author is questionable. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping is a privacy violation, and trust should be built on mutual respect rather than surveillance.\n"
