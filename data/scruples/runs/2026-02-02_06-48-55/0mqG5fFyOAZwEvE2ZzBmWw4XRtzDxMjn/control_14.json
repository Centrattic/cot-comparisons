A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for snooping on their partner's phone. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, feeling a gut feeling something's wrong, snooped his phone while he was asleep and found he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled, saying they invaded his privacy and didn't trust him.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they did it because they sensed something was really wrong, unlike friends who snoop out of nosiness. They argue that they prevented future heartbreak by finding out early.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Snooping is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if there's suspicion of cheating, the act of checking someone's phone without consent is problematic. Relationships are built on trust, and breaking that trust by invading privacy can cause harm even if the outcome is justified. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also valid\u2014he felt betrayed by the lack of trust. The author might have had a reason, but the method was invasive. There's a difference between being proactive about trust issues and respecting boundaries. The author might argue they saved themselves pain, but the action itself is still an ethical breach.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that in cases of potential betrayal, the ends justify the means. But generally, in ethical discussions, respecting privacy is a cornerstone. Even if the outcome is positive, the act of snooping is typically viewed as wrong because it undermines mutual trust and consent in a relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping violates the partner's privacy, regardless of the outcome. Even with good intentions, the method used was a breach of trust and boundaries.\n"
