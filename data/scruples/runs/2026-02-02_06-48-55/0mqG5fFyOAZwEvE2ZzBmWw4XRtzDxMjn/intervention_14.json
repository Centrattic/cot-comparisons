A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author got a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, but he called and accused them of not trusting him and being a piece of shit. The author defends their actions by saying they did it out of concern and to avoid future heartbreak, and they're against snooping just for being nosy.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is privacy. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if there are suspicions, doing so without talking it out first can be problematic. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the author didn't trust him, and trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. \n\nBut then again, the author did have a valid reason\u2014they found out about the cheating. The question is whether the means justified the end. Some people might argue that if you have a feeling something's wrong, you should confront the person directly instead of invading their privacy. Others might say that when there's a strong suspicion of betrayal, seeking evidence is understandable.\n\nThe author mentions they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a real reason, which adds a nuance. They differentiate between being proactive due to genuine concerns and just being nosy. However, even with \"good\" intentions, the act itself is still a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the hurt from the violation of trust, not just the discovery of the cheating.\n\nIn relationships, communication is usually the first step. The author didn't talk to their partner first, which could have resolved the issue without the invasive measure. By snooping, they took a step that might have been avoidable if they had discussed their concerns openly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions did lead to them leaving a harmful situation. They avoided prolonged heartbreak, which is a valid outcome. But does that make the means right? It's a tricky balance between protecting oneself and respecting boundaries.\n\nI think the consensus here leans towards the author being in the wrong because the act of snooping is a privacy violation, regardless of the outcome. Trust and communication are crucial, and bypassing that process, even with good intentions, can cause harm. However, some might argue that their actions were justified given the cheating. But in terms of right or wrong, the act itself is still ethically questionable.\n"
