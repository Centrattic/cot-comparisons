A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong and decided to snoop his phone while he was asleep. They found that he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy and said it showed a lack of trust.\n\nThe author defends their actions by saying they weren't just being nosy like their friends, but they had a reason. They feel they saved themselves future heartbreak by discovering the infidelity early.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, snooping through someone's phone without their consent is a privacy violation. Trust is a big part of relationships, and invading privacy can be seen as a breach of that trust, regardless of the outcome. Cheating is obviously problematic, but does that justify the means of discovering it through snooping?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was based on a legitimate concern that something was wrong. They weren't just being nosy but acted on a feeling that their partner was dishonest. The result was uncovering a betrayal, which the author argues was necessary to avoid prolonged pain.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if the outcome was good, the method involved breaking trust. Relationships require mutual trust, and snooping undermines that. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping could be seen as the author not trusting their partner initially. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling betrayed by the snooping is valid because trust is a two-way street. The author might say they had a reason, but the partner's feelings of privacy being violated are also valid.\n\nAlso, maybe there were other ways to address the issue. Communication could have been the first step. If the boyfriend was being distant and not opening up, the author could have tried to understand better or seek couples' counseling. Snooping might have been a hasty decision that caused additional hurt to the relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is a fundamental right. Even in a relationship, individuals have the right to privacy. Unauthorized access to someone's phone is generally considered a violation, regardless of intentions. The ends don't always justify the means, especially when it comes to personal trust and respect.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might have been to protect themselves from future harm, the method of snooping without consent is problematic. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust, which is a core element of any healthy relationship. Even if the cheating was happening, the act of snooping could be seen as the author's mistake in handling the situation.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, which is a significant breach of trust, regardless of the outcome.\n"
