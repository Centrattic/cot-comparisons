A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The scenario is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author found out he was cheating by checking his phone. Now, they left a note and left, but he yelled at them for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping into someone's phone without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if there's a suspicion of cheating, it's generally considered wrong because it violates trust. But there's also the argument that the author discovered the truth and avoided further heartbreak.\n\nThe user mentions that the author isn't in favor of snooping out of nosiness but did it because they had a strong feeling something was wrong. However, consent is a big issue here. Trust in a relationship is built on mutual respect, and checking the phone without consent can be seen as undermining that trust, regardless of the outcome.\n\nAnother angle is the partner's reaction. He accused the author of not trusting him, which is valid because snooping implies distrust. The author might argue self-preservation, but the method used could be problematic. Maybe confronting him directly first would have been better, even if it led to conflict.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author left a note and didn't confront him in person might have escalated the situation. The partner's anger is a response to the invasion of privacy, not just the cheating itself. \n\nIn terms of societal views, opinions vary. Some might empathize with wanting to know the truth, while others stress the importance of trust and communication. Legally, snooping isn't illegal, but ethically, it's debatable.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though the outcome was the truth, the method (snooping) without discussion is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
