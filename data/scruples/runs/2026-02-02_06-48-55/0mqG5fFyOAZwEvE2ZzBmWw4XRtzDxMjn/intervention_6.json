A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone and finding out they're cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and after snooping, they found evidence of him cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend got angry about the privacy invasion. The author defends their action by saying they had a gut feeling and wanted to avoid future heartbreak, contrasting with friends who snoop out of nosiness without reason.\n\nNow, considering relationships and trust. Trust is a big factor here. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping itself is an invasion of privacy. In healthy relationships, partners should communicate openly. The author didn't confront the boyfriend directly but went behind his back. While the outcome was revealing the infidelity, the method involved breaking trust. \n\nBut then, the alternative is staying in a relationship where they're being cheated on. The author might argue they saved themselves from more hurt. However, the act of snooping is generally considered wrong because it breaches privacy. Even if the motive is suspicion, trust is foundational. \n\nSome might argue that if someone is already cheating, they've broken the relationship's trust, so the author's action was justified. But others would say that privacy matters, and the proper approach would be to address the distance and concerns through communication instead of snooping.\n\nThe author mentions they're against unnecessary snooping, which shows they know it's a gray area. Still, in this case, they did it because they felt something was wrong. The question is whether the means justify the ends. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy is important unless there's a compelling reason. However, in a cheating scenario, the cheater is the one at fault. The author's action might be seen as wrong because they violated privacy, but the cheating was on the boyfriend. \n\nSo, there's a conflict here. The author's action is ethically questionable because of the privacy violation, but the boyfriend's cheating is clearly wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but some might sympathize because they uncovered the truth. \n\nI need to decide between A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No). The answer likely depends on cultural or personal values. If the focus is on the act of snooping, then A. If the focus is on the cheating being discovered, then B. But generally, snooping is considered a breach of trust, so even if it leads to a good outcome, the action itself is in the wrong.\n"
