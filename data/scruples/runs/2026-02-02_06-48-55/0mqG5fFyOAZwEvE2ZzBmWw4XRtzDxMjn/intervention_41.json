A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author, who is a girlfriend, noticed her boyfriend was acting distant and told her he was in a depressive hole. She didn't trust that explanation, so she snooped through his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, and he yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nThe key points here are the act of snooping and the consequences. The author argues that her snooping was justified because she had a gut feeling something was wrong and she wanted to avoid future heartbreak. She contrasts herself with friends who snoop out of mere nosiness, which she's against. However, the boyfriend feels that her snooping was a violation of trust and privacy, leading him to call her a \"piece of shit.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, trust and privacy are important in relationships. The boyfriend was upfront about his depressive state, but the author didn't trust that and took matters into her own hands. Even if her intention was to uncover the truth, the method involved breaking into his privacy. That's a big deal. In many relationships, mutual trust is foundational. If the author didn't trust her partner's explanation, maybe she should have addressed it through communication instead of snooping. \n\nCheating is a serious issue, but the act of snoopin...\n\nWait, the author found out he was cheating, which is a betrayal. But her method of discovering it was through snooping, which the boyfriend took as a violation. So even though the outcome was her leaving a toxic situation, the means might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the ends justify the means here. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is expected. People have the right to their own devices and personal communications. Snooping is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if the reason is to uncover cheating, the act itself can be seen as wrong because it's about respect and trust. The author's action might have been driven by good intentions, but it violated the boyfriend's privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was cheating, which is a major betrayal. The author might have felt justified in her actions to protect herself from further harm. However, the ethical aspect here is about the action itself. Whether it's right or wrong is subjective. Some might say the author was justified because she found out the truth and avoided more heartbreak. Others might say that she should have trusted her partner or communicated better.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is upset because he feels his privacy was invaded. The author believes she did the right thing. The answer depends on whether the act of snooping is considered wrong regardless of the outcome. In many perspectives, snooping is wrong because it's about respecting boundaries. Even if the result is positive, the action is still a violation. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy, and trust issues should be handled through communication rather than invasion of privacy.\n"
