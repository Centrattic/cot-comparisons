A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's boyfriend was acting distant and said he was in a depressive hole. The author suspected something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled at her for invading his privacy. She argues that she did it because she had a gut feeling something was really wrong, not just out of nosiness. She also mentions she's against snooping for no reason but in this case felt it was justified to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the moral and ethical aspects. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. Snooping without consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping undermines trust. The author's justification is that she wanted to prevent future pain, but the means used (snooping) is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was being deceptive by not being honest about his infidelity, which is also wrong. The author's action was a response to betrayal, but does that excuse her action? \n\nLegally, snooping through someone's phone without their consent can be a privacy violation in many places. Ethically, it's a gray area. While the intention was to uncover the truth, the method involved breaking trust. \n\nThe author says she's against snooping unless there's a strong reason, which she claims was the case here. But even with a reason, the act itself is a breach. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling untrusted is valid. Trust is mutual, and snooping can be seen as a failure to trust, even if the other person is unfaithful. \n\nHowever, the outcome was positive in a way\u2014he was cheating, and she avoided more pain. But does the end justify the means? In ethics, sometimes people debate that. But in real relationships, the act of snooping can cause significant damage to the relationship's foundation regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the boyfriend was cheating, the author's action was a violation of his privacy. Therefore, she is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
