A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author says their boyfriend was acting distant and when asked, he mentioned being in a depressive hole. But the author felt there was something wrong and decided to snoop through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating, left a note, and then he yelled at her for invading his privacy and said she didn't trust him. The author justifies it by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether snooping was justified. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, cheating is a betrayal, so finding out about it is important. But the method used was invading his privacy without his consent. Trust is a big part of relationships, and checking someone's phone without their knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust, even if the action was discovered. The boyfriend might have a right to privacy, and the author's actions, while stemming from suspicion, crossed a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a concern and the cheating was real. They might have felt hurt and wanted to protect themselves from future pain. But even so, the act of snooping is a moral issue. Some might argue that it's understandable given the cheating, but others would say the means were wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nI think the key here is that snooping without consent is generally considered wrong. Even if the reason is suspicion of infidelity, the act itself breaches the trust and privacy. The author could have addressed the distance in a more open way, like talking to him or seeking couples counseling. By snooping, they preempted any possible trust and acted on their own, which might not be the right approach. \n\nTheir justification is that it saved future heartbreak, but that doesn't necessarily make the action ethical. The boyfriend's reaction about privacy and trust is valid because the method used to uncover the truth was intrusive. So yes, the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the outcome confirmed their fears. The right thing would be to not snoop and instead communicate or find other ways to address the issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n"
