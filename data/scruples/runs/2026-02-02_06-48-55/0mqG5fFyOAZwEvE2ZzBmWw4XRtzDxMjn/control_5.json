A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone. The person says their boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. But they couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they checked his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he yelled at them for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust. But the author mentions they had a valid reason\u2014they found out about the cheating. So maybe they saw it as self-preservation.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a serious issue. If the partner was unfaithful, the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. But the method of discovering it through snooping complicates things. Some might argue that trust is foundational in a relationship, and if you can't trust your partner, the relationship is already in trouble. However, snooping could be seen as a violation of that trust, even if it led to a justified outcome.\n\nThe author also differentiates themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness, which adds a layer of self-justification. They believe they did it for a good reason. But does that make it right? Ethically, actions are judged by their intent and consequences. The consequence here was ending a cheating relationship, which is positive, but the action of snooping might still be considered wrong because it's a violation of privacy.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reaction. He felt betrayed by the snooping, even though he was cheating. That's a bit ironic, but it shows that his actions (cheating) were wrong, and the author's action (snooping) led to the truth. However, the author's decision to snoop might have been necessary to uncover the infidelity, which is a valid reason. But does that excuse the action? It's a tough call.\n\nLegally, snooping through someone's phone without consent is often against privacy laws, but the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. Morally, it's about respect for autonomy. Even if the outcome was good, the method was a violation. So, the author might be in the wrong for the action, even if the result was saving themselves from heartbreak.\n\nBut wait, if the relationship was already built on a lack of trust because the boyfriend was cheating, maybe the author's action was a necessary evil to uncover the deceit. Cheating is a betrayal, so maybe the author's snooping was a justified act of self-protection. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting themselves from further harm.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: Did the author have a valid reason? Yes. But did they violate trust by snooping? Yes. However, the cheating partner was the one who broke the trust first. The author's action was a response to that breach. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were uncovering a betrayal that the partner was trying to hide. The problem is that the author chose to snoop instead of confronting the partner about their suspicions. Maybe there's a better way, but in the context of the situation, the author's action led to a positive outcome despite the method.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that privacy is important regardless of the situation, then the answer would be A. If we consider that the circumstances justified the action, then B. It's a bit of a gray area. However, many ethical frameworks would say that respecting a partner's privacy is important unless there's a compelling reason. But in this case, the compelling reason was the cheating. So the author's action was a necessary to prevent further harm. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
