A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he mentioned being in a depressive hole. But the author still felt something was wrong and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion, calling the author a piece of shit. The author justifies it by saying they prevented future heartbreak and that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a real reason.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the snoop justified? Trust issues in a relationship... Privacy vs. betrayal. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If you don't trust your partner, that's a big red flag. Cheating is a serious issue, so if the author discovered it through snooping, maybe they had a reason. But the act of snooping itself is a violation of privacy. Even if there's suspicion, does that make it okay?\n\nSome people might argue that the author acted out of self-preservation, saving themselves from more heartache. Others might say that trust is foundational, and snooping undermines that. The author mentions they aren't in favor of snooping without a good reason, but in this case, they felt justified. \n\nBut then, if the relationship is built on trust, the author's actions could be seen as breaking that trust, even if the reason was valid. Also, the boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of privacy. Even if he was cheating, the method of discovery might affect how the situation is handled. \n\nLegally, maybe there are no issues, but ethically? It's tricky. Relationships involve mutual respect, and snooping can be a breach of that. However, if one partner is unfaithful, the other might feel wronged. The author left the relationship, which is their right, but the means of discovering it might still be problematic. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends. The author avoided future pain, but at the cost of invading privacy. Trust is a two-way street. If the boyfriend was cheating, he already broke trust. The author's snooping might be seen as a response to that broken trust, trying to uncover the truth. But does that make it right?\n\nAlternatively, the author should have confronted the boyfriend first, tried to communicate, or had a discussion instead of resorting to snooping. Maybe that's a better approach. But the author felt that something was seriously wrong and couldn't wait. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, cheating is a major issue, and the author's actions led to ending the relationship. On the other hand, the method used was a privacy violation. If the author had trust issues, maybe the relationship had underlying problems from the start. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because, while the boyfriend cheated, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, the means were ethically questionable. However, others might argue that in a situation of cheating, the privacy violation is justified. But generally, I think respecting each other's privacy is important, and if trust is already shaky, communication is better than snooping. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
