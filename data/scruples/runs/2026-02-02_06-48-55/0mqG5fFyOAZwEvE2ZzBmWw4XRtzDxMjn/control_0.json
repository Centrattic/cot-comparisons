A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone and finding out about an affair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of any relationship. Cheating is a violation of trust, but so is snooping. The author admits to invading privacy, which is a clear breach of trust. However, their reasoning is that they wanted to uncover the infidelity they suspected.\n\nThe author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and claimed to be in a depressive hole. The user then took it upon themselves to check his phone, which led them to discover the affair. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend reacted angrily. He accused them of not trusting him, which is a valid point because snooping requires a lack of trust.\n\nThe user argues that they did it to save themselves future heartbreak, which is a common justification. But the problem is that the act of snooping itself can damage the relationship. Even if the justification is valid, the method of uncovering the infidelity might be questionable. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is usually encouraged. Instead of snooping, the user might have been better off discussing their concerns with the partner. However, given that the partner was being evasive, the user might have felt they had no other option. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, respecting privacy is important. Even if the user had good intentions, the act of snooping is generally considered wrong. The boyfriend's reaction about broken trust is valid because trust is a two-way street. \n\nSo, while the user's intention was to find out the truth, the method they used to get that truth might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
