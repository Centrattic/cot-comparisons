A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone and finding out about an affair. They argue that they didn't snoop out of nosiness but because they had a bad feeling, and they think it saved them from future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there are trust issues, invading someone's privacy without consent can be problematic. The author found out the truth, but maybe there's a better way to address the issue, like communication. They did leave a note, which is a bit abrupt, but the act of snooping itself is the main point here.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner was cheating, so maybe the snooping was a way to uncover betrayal. But does that justify the means? The author mentions they had a valid reason, like the partner acting distant and being in a depressive state, which might not be a good excuse for cheating. However, the act of checking the phone without permission is still a breach of trust.\n\nThe user's friends snoop for no reason, but the author distinguishes their case by saying they had a feeling something was wrong. But even with good intentions, the method is questionable. Relationships require trust, and snooping can erode that trust. The partner felt betrayed by the invasion of privacy, leading to the argument and the end of the relationship. \n\nSo, the question is whether the ends justify the means. The author found the truth and ended a harmful situation, but did it in a way that violated their partner's privacy. Different people might have different views. Some might say that if the partner was cheating, the snooping was justified. Others might say that trust should be the foundation, and if you can't trust them, the relationship was already in trouble. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the situation\u2014leaving a note and not confronting the partner directly\u2014might be seen as cowardly. Confrontation could have led to a different outcome, but it's not clear. The partner's reaction was defensive, which might have been exacerbated by the snooping.\n\nIn the end, I think the consensus is that while the cheating partner was wrong, the act of snooping without consent is still a breach of privacy. So the author is in the wrong for invading their partner's privacy, even if it led to uncovering the truth. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
