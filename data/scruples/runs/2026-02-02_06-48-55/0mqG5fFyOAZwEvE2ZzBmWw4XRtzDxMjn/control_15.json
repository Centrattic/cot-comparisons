A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the cheating. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's partner was acting distant and gave a vague explanation about being in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they snooped and found out the partner was cheating. They left a note and left, then the partner yelled at them for invading privacy and said it proves lack of trust.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Is snooping justified? The author mentions they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they had here. They also contrast their situation with friends who snoop out of nosey behavior, implying that in their case, it was for a valid reason.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, privacy is important in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, invading someone's privacy can be seen as a breach of trust. However, the partner was actually cheating, so maybe the snooping was a necessary action to uncover the betrayal. The author argues that they saved themselves future heartbreak, which is a valid point. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner felt that the snooping was a violation and that it showed a lack of trust. The author's actions led to the immediate end of the relationship, which might be seen as a justified outcome, but does that make the snooping right? \n\nDifferent perspectives: Some might say that even if the partner was cheating, the means of finding out (snooping) were wrong. Others might say that when trust is broken, the wronged person has the right to seek the truth. \n\nI need to weigh these viewpoints. In many cases, privacy is a mutual agreement in relationships. If one partner feels the need to violate that privacy, it's often considered a mistake because it can cause further damage. However, in this case, the cheating was real, so the snooping revealed a betrayal that the partner was hiding. \n\nBut does that justify the snooping? Maybe not. The author could have approached the situation differently, like having an open conversation instead of snooping. However, the partner's behavior was already distant and dismissive, making it hard for the author to have that conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the cheating was real and the author's suspicions were correct, the act of snooping still involved invading privacy, which can be seen as wrong. However, the author's intent was to uncover the truth to protect themselves. It's a bit of a gray area, but depending on the values one holds\u2014some might say the author is in the wrong for violating privacy, others might say they did the right thing to discover the infidelity.\n"
