A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped while he was asleep and discovered he was cheating. They left a note and then he yelled at them for invading his privacy.\n\nThe question is about whether snooping was justified. The author mentions that they are against snooping unless there's a strong reason, and in this case, they found evidence of cheating. They argue it saved them future heartbreak.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, snooping typically violates privacy. Even if there's suspicion, going through someone's phone without consent is a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because privacy is a key aspect of relationships. However, the author's intention was to uncover the truth, not just out of being nosy. They felt they had a valid reason based on their observations.\n\nBut the key issue here is the method. Trust is fundamental, and when it's broken, it affects the relationship. The author's action, while perhaps leading to a justified outcome, was done without communication or consent. There might have been a better way to address the suspicion, like talking openly about their concerns instead of snooping. \n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend was already in a depressive state complicates things. Maybe his behavior was due to his mental health, and the author's snooping contributed to the conflict. However, the cheating was real, so the outcome was valid. But the means\u2014snooping\u2014still raises ethical questions. \n\nThe author's friends snoop for no reason, but here there was a reason. Still, the act itself is problematic regardless of the outcome. The rightness or wrongness of the action might not solely depend on the result. Privacy violation is a breach, even if the result is uncovering a betrayal. \n\nSo, while the cheating is the boyfriend's fault, the author's decision to snoop without addressing the issue directly could be seen as wrong. It's a tough call, but generally, snooping isn't considered right even if it prevents heartbreak later. Trust and open communication are usually better approaches. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
