A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after checking his phone, the author found out he was cheating. The boyfriend reacted angrily, saying it was a privacy violation and that the author didn't trust him. The author justifies it by saying they were saving themselves future heartbreak.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the act of snooping itself. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Even if there's suspicion, invading someone's privacy without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions they didn't trust their intuition and felt something was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Trust is a two-way street, and if the boyfriend was being distant, maybe communication should have been addressed first instead of checking the phone.\n\nHowever, the author also points out that they aren't in favor of casual snooping without reason, which shows they understand the issue. Their action was based on a legitimate concern (cheating) and it turned out to be true. They could argue that they were protecting themselves from further emotional harm. \n\nBut then again, the method they used was invasive. Even if the outcome was valid, the means might still be considered wrong. The boyfriend's reaction about privacy and trust makes sense. If someone feels their privacy was violated, it can cause additional hurt, regardless of the truth found. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. Maybe the author should have confronted the boyfriend first, given him a chance to explain before taking matters into their own hands. Instead, they left a note, which might have been a way to avoid a direct confrontation. But leaving a note without discussing it could be seen as cutting off communication, which isn't helpful.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the action led to uncovering the truth and ending a harmful situation. On the other hand, the method was a privacy violation. Different people have different opinions on this. Some might say that if the cheating was happening, the person was already being dishonest, so the snooping was justified. Others might say that trust should be maintained, and if there's a lack of trust, then the relationship isn't healthy anyway.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, invading someone's privacy is generally frowned upon unless there's a serious risk. The author did have a reason, but the decision to snoop is still a breach. However, the outcome was that the author avoided future heartbreak, which might balance things out for some people.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the act of snooping is considered wrong regardless of the outcome. If the focus is on the action itself, then A (yes). If the focus is on the result and the author's intention to protect themselves, then B (no). But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that privacy is a significant factor, I lean towards A. Even though the action had a valid reason, the method used was a violation of privacy, which is a key point in the boyfriend's anger. So the author might be seen as wrong for not respecting the partner's privacy, even if their intention was justified.\n"
