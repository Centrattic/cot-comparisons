A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a partner who noticed their boyfriend was acting distant and seemed down. When they asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. But the author felt something was wrong and decided to snoop through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he had a girl on the side. Then they left a note and left. The boyfriend was upset, yelling at the author for invading his privacy and saying it shows a lack of trust. The author argues that they did it because they had a strong feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness like some friends. They believe it saved them from future heartbreak.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the act of snooping. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, going through someone's phone without their consent is a violation of trust. The boyfriend was honest about his depression, but the author didn't give him the benefit of the doubt. Instead, they assumed the worst and acted on it. \n\nCheating is a serious issue, and the author found out through snooping. However, the method used might not be justifiable. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. If the author didn't trust their partner, maybe communication was the issue. The boyfriend was open about his depression but maybe didn't want to discuss the affair. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the outcome was that the author left the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were protecting themselves from further pain. They weren't just snooping out of jealousy but because they had a strong intuition something was wrong. Their friends do it for no reason, but they didn't. However, regardless of the reason, the act itself is still a violation of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction about distrust is valid because the author didn't trust him, even though he was honest about his depression. \n\nBut then, if the boyfriend was lying about his depression to cover up the affair, maybe the author had a reason. However, the boyfriend did mention he was in a depressive hole, which could be true. The author didn't confront him directly, which might have been a better approach. Confrontation could have led to an honest conversation without the need for snooping.\n\nIn many cases, snooping is considered a breach of trust. Even if it leads to a positive outcome for the person doing it, the method is still questionable. The author might have been justified in leaving the relationship once they found out, but the snoop itself is where the issue lies. The boyfriend's anger about privacy invasion makes sense because it's a significant breach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author made a choice to snoop, which is generally seen as wrong, regardless of the outcome. Even if it led to the truth coming out, the act itself violates the partner's privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
