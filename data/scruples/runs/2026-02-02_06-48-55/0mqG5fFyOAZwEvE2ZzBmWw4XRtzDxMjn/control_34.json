A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping on someone's phone is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the person had a reason, like suspicion of cheating, the act itself is invasive. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and snooping can break that trust. The author's boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was invaded, which is a valid reaction.\n\nBut then, the author's reasoning is that they found out the truth and avoided future heartbreak. They mention that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they had here. The boyfriend was acting distant and claimed to be in a depressive hole, but the author had a gut feeling something was wrong. The fact that he was cheating adds another layer\u2014maybe the author's action prevented more harm in the long run.\n\nI should also think about consent and mutual respect. Even if the partner is unfaithful, the act of snooping without consent is still a breach. Some might argue that the ends justified the means, but others might say that the method was wrong. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting boundaries. The author left a note and left, which shows they didn't confront him immediately, possibly to avoid an emotional outburst. However, the boyfriend's reaction shows that the act of snooping caused immediate harm to the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have addressed the distance and suspicion through conversation first, but they chose to snoop instead. That might be seen as taking a shortcut that undermines trust and communication.\n\nSo, the author did something that hurt the relationship, even if it revealed the truth. The question is whether the means were justified. Different people have different views on this. Some might say the author was justified in protecting themselves, while others would say it's always wrong to invade someone's privacy regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motivation was to uncover the truth and prevent further pain, the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about privacy and trust. However, from a general standpoint, invading someone's privacy is typically considered wrong, even if it leads to a positive outcome. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there are valid arguments on both sides.\n"
