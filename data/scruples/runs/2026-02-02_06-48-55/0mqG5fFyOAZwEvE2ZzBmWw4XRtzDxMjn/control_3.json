A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author suspected something was wrong, so they snooped through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Then they left a note and left, and the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe author argues that they did the right thing because they uncovered the cheating and saved themselves future heartbreak. They mention that they aren't pro-snooping for no reason but felt it was necessary here. The boyfriend, on the other hand, felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: cheating vs. privacy violation. If the boyfriend was cheating, then the author found out through snooping. But does the method justify the outcome? Trust is a big part of a relationship. Even if there was cheating, snooping without consent is a violation of privacy. The boyfriend might feel that the trust was broken because the author didn't trust him and checked his phone. Even though he was cheating, the act of snooping might be considered wrong because it invades privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt they had a valid reason to snoop because of the suspicion of cheating. They could argue that they were protecting themselves from ongoing harm. But does that make the action justifiable? Relationships require mutual trust and communication. Instead of snooping, the author might have tried to communicate more or address the distance without invading privacy. \n\nSo the question is whether breaking the privacy rule is acceptable even if it leads to a truth. In many cases, people would say that snooping is wrong regardless of the reason, because it undermines trust. Even if the cheating is true, the method of finding out could lead to more conflict. The author's actions might be seen as the wrong because they violated privacy, even if the cheating exists. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that the cheating is a bigger issue and the author did what was necessary to escape a harmful situation. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the act of snooping. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, generally, snooping without consent is considered unethical, even if the outcome is beneficial. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But I'm a bit conflicted because the cheating is real. However, the act of snooping is still a violation. So probably A.\n"
