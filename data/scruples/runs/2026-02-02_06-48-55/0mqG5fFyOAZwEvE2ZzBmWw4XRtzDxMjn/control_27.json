A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately.

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong and decided to snoop through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at her for invading his privacy and said it showed a lack of trust.\n\nThe author argues that they did it because they had a strong sense something was really wrong, not just out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves from future heartbreak by knowing the truth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, snooping into someone's phone is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping without consent can be seen as a breach of that trust. However, the author had a reason\u2014they suspected infidelity and found evidence. But does that justify the means?\n\nSome might say that if the boyfriend was indeed cheating, the author is not entirely at fault because they discovered the truth. Others might argue that regardless of the outcome, the method was wrong because it eroded trust. The boyfriend's reaction was anger, which suggests that the act of snooping hurt him, even if the conclusion was true.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. In a healthy relationship, discussing concerns openly is usually preferred over sifting through someone's private devices. The author's action might have been driven by valid concerns, but the method could have been handled differently. For example, confronting the boyfriend directly after noticing the behavior instead of snooping.\n\nThe author also mentions that they are against snooping for no reason, only when they feel something is really wrong. That might make their action seem more justified in their own mind, but others might still see it as a violation.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the outcome was that the author found out the truth and avoided further pain. But the means involved breaking trust and invading privacy. Depending on the perspective, the answer could vary. However, traditionally, violating someone's privacy is considered wrong, even if the result is beneficial. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, despite the valid reason.\n"
