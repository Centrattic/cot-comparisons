A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author snooped through their boyfriend's phone and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading his privacy and said it shows lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that they had a gut feeling something was wrong, and by snooping, they discovered the infidelity early, avoiding more heartbreak. They also mention that they're not pro-snooping unless there's a real reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is that the privacy invasion is a betrayal of trust. Trust is a key component in any relationship. Even if there were suspicions, going through someone's phone without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. The author's action might have been motivated by concern, but the method used is ethically questionable.\n\nNow, considering the moral and social norms. While discovering the infidelity might have been the result, the act of snooping itself is typically seen as wrong because it breaches trust. Relationships are built on mutual respect and trust. Even if the boyfriend was unfaithful, the author's choice to snoop rather than confront or address the issues openly could be problematic. The author's justification is that they wanted to avoid future heartbreak, but the means used are still a violation.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: if the partner is already being deceptive, maybe the trust was already broken. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of snooping is generally viewed as wrong, regardless of the outcome. Even if the result was uncovering the truth, the method is still considered unethical by many standards.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated their partner's privacy, which is a breach of trust. Even though the outcome might have been justified in their eyes, the action itself is still considered wrong by most moral standards.\n"
