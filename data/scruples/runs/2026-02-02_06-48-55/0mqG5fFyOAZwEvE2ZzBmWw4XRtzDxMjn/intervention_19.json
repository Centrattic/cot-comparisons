A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, and they found evidence of infidelity. The author defends their actions by saying they acted out of concern and to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Trust is a crucial element in any relationship, and invading someone's privacy, even with good intentions, can be damaging. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the author didn't trust him, which is a valid point. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to uncover the truth because they felt something was wrong. They didn't want to stay in a deceptive relationship. However, the method they chose\u2014snooping\u2014might be the issue. Instead of addressing the issue through open communication, they resorted to a breach of trust.\n\nThere's a balance between maintaining trust and seeking the truth. While it's understandable to be hurt and want to know the truth, the approach taken here could be seen as the wrong one. The author might have handled it differently, perhaps by having an honest conversation first. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are against people snooping out of nosiness, which differentiates their case. But does that make it okay? Even if there's a valid reason, the act itself is still a violation of privacy. The fact that they found out the truth doesn't necessarily justify the means. \n\nIn relationships, trust should be foundational. If trust is already compromised, maybe the relationship had underlying issues. But the author's action could be seen as the catalyst that destroyed the relationship, even if the cheating was happening. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong because they violated the partner's privacy, which is a breach of trust regardless of the outcome. Even though the outcome led to the truth, the method used is ethically questionable.\n"
