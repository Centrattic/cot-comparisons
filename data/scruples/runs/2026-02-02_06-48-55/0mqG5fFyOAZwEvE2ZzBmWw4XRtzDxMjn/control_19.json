A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The answer needs to be either A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating, left a note, and ended up in a conflict where he accused them of not trusting him. The author feels they did the right thing because they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the core issue here is about snooping vs. trust in a relationship. The author justifies their actions by the cheating discovery and the belief that it prevented more pain. However, the boyfriend felt that the snooping was an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, respecting a partner's privacy is important. Unless there's explicit consent, looking through someone's phone without their knowledge is generally considered a violation. Even if the author had a suspicion, the act of snooping itself can be seen as a breach, regardless of the outcome. \n\nThe author mentions they are against snooping unless something is really wrong, which suggests they see it as a last resort. But in this case, the boyfriend was cheating, so the snoop led to the truth. However, the method used to uncover the truth might still be problematic. Trust is a two-way street. If one partner doesn't trust the other, that can be a significant issue, even if the suspicion was right. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling the author a piece of shit\u2014indicates that he felt deeply betrayed by their actions. The author might have felt justified, but the act of snooping without prior discussion or consent could be seen as the initial wrongdoing. \n\nThere's also the point about the author's friends snooping for no good reason. The author differentiates their own actions by saying they had a real reason, but the act itself is still considered wrong by many standards. \n\nSo, even though the outcome was the truth, the action of snooping is typically considered a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the method they used, even if the result was beneficial. The answer would be A.\n"
