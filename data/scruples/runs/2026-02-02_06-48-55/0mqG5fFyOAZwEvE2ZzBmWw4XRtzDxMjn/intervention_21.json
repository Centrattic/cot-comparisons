A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by snooping through their partner's phone and leaving a note before leaving. The situation is a classic case of a cheating partner caught through snooping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of snooping. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if one partner is acting suspiciously, invading their privacy without consent is generally seen as a violation. The author admits they snoop only when they sense something is really wrong, which they differentiate from friends who do it out of nosiness. But the key point is whether their action was justified.\n\nThe boyfriend was already distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author might have thought they were protecting themselves from potential heartbreak. However, the response\u2014snooping and then leaving without confrontation\u2014could be seen as harsh. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the privacy was violated, which led to the argument.\n\nTrust is fundamental in a relationship. By snooping, the author broke that trust, even if the intention was to uncover infidelity. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling her a \"piece of shit\" shows the emotional impact of her actions. While the outcome (discovering the affair) might have been valid, the method could be ethically questionable. \n\nThe author's justification is that they saved themselves future heartbreak. But relationships require mutual trust and communication. If there were concerns, the proper approach would be to address them openly instead of resorting to snooping. The author might have been right to end the relationship, but the method of doing so by spying undermines the trust and respect that should exist between partners.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the outcome was the truth coming out, the act of snooping itself is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
