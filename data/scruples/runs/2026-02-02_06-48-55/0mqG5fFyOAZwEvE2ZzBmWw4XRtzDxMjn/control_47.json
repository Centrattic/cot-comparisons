A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation involves the boyfriend being distant, the author checking his phone and finding out about his affair, then leaving a note and a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Trust is a big part of any partnership, and invading someone's privacy without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. But the author had a reason\u2014they felt something was wrong and found out about the cheating. The question is whether the means justified the ends here.\n\nThe author mentions they snoop because they had a gut feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop without reason, which might show they think their action was justified. However, even if there's a bad feeling, does that give someone the right to check their partner's phone secretly?\n\nOn one hand, the author's action led to them finding out about the infidelity, preventing future heartbreak. On the other hand, snooping without consent, regardless of the outcome, can be seen as a violation of privacy. The partner reacted angrily, feeling that the lack of trust was hurtful. So, while the author might have found out the truth, the method could be problematic.\n\nBut there's also the argument about the trust being broken by the partner's infidelity. If the partner was cheating, maybe the trust was already compromised. However, the author's action of snooping might have made things worse by not addressing the issue directly. They left a note and didn't confront him immediately, which might have been a mistake in communication.\n\nDifferent perspectives: Some might say the ends justify the means because the author avoided ongoing harm. Others might say that respecting privacy is crucial, and even if the partner was cheating, the author should have addressed the distance or concerns through open communication instead of spying.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nature of trust. Trust isn't just about being faithful; it's also about respecting each other's boundaries. The author's action, while stemming from a place of wanting to protect themselves, might have undermined the trust in the relationship. However, given that the partner was unfaithful, the author's action could be seen as a necessary evil.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong here, but generally, invading someone's privacy without their consent is considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, the context of the cheating complicates things. But according to the question, the user wants a binary answer (A or B). In such cases, societal views often lean towards privacy violations being wrong even if the result is good. So Answer A.\n"
