A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering an affair.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author admits to snooping without the partner's knowledge. Even though they had a suspicion something was wrong, going through someone's phone without permission is a clear invasion of privacy. Most relationships are built on trust, and violating that trust by snooping, regardless of the reason, can be seen as a breach of that foundation. \n\nThe author mentions that they felt justified because they discovered the infidelity. But the act itself\u2014checking the phone without consent\u2014is where the issue lies. The partner then reacted angrily, feeling that the lack of trust was the real problem. The author's justification is that they saved themselves future heartbreak, but the method used to uncover the infidelity is problematic. \n\nSome might argue that the ends justify the means, but in ethical terms, respecting privacy is important even in difficult situations. The fact that the author had friends who snoop without reason but differentiates themselves shows they understand the issue, yet still chose to act. \n\nSo, considering the violation of privacy and the lack of mutual trust, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
