A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, not trusting that explanation, checked his phone while he was asleep and found he was cheating. Then the author left a note and left, and the boyfriend was angry about the invasion of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping on someone's phone is generally seen as a violation of privacy. Even if there are suspicions, accessing private information without consent is a breach of trust. The author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they felt was the case here. However, even with good intentions, the act itself is problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend was honest about his depression but the author didn't trust him. Maybe there were red flags before, but the decision to check his phone without discussing it first is a major issue. The author's action might have been driven by their gut feeling, but communication is key in relationships. Instead of snooping, maybe talking it out more, setting boundaries, or seeking couples' counseling could have been a better approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the author found out about the infidelity through their own initiative. They prevented further heartbreak by leaving. But the method used to find out is still a violation. The boyfriend's anger is valid because privacy was breached. Even if the outcome was necessary, the means might still make the author at fault. \n\nThe question is whether the ends justify the means. The author's intention was to protect themselves from future heartbreak, which is understandable. However, the act of snooping is universally frowned upon because it undermines trust. Relationships require mutual trust, and if that's missing, maybe the relationship was already in trouble. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the boyfriend directly but just left a note. That could be seen as avoiding a necessary confrontation, which might have been painful but necessary for closure. The boyfriend was upset not just about the cheating but about the privacy invasion. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author did something wrong by snooping. Even though the outcome was good, the action was a breach of privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
