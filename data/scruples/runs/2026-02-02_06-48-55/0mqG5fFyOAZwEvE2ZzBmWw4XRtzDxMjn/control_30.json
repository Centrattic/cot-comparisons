A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and after some time, they decided to snoop his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating and then left a note before leaving. The boyfriend later yelled at them for invading privacy and accused them of not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that they did it because they had a good reason\u2014suspecting infidelity\u2014and that they're not like their friends who snoop out of nosiness. They believe they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Snooping into someone's phone is generally a breach of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, the method they used was invasive. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and using deception to uncover the truth might be seen as undermining that trust. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping could be viewed as violating their partner's privacy, regardless of the outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt they had a valid reason, and the result was that they caught the cheating early. But the means justify the ends? Arguably, the wrong action (snooping) was committed, even if the outcome was beneficial. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is a point here; the author's actions did indeed breach trust by invading privacy, even if it revealed a betrayal first.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the action itself is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the result was the exposure of cheating.\n"
