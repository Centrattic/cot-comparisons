A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the partner was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the partner was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my take. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is a big deal. Even in a relationship, people are expected to have some boundaries. Snooping without permission breaches trust. But the author had a reason\u2014they suspected cheating and wanted to avoid more heartbreak. However, the act of snooping itself is problematic regardless of the outcome. \n\nThe author mentions they're against snooping for no reason but did it because they felt something was wrong. The justification here is that they found out the truth and ended the relationship, which they see as saving themselves future pain. But even if the result was good, the action of invading privacy is still an issue. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and snooping undermines that. Even if the partner was cheating, the right approach might have been to confront them directly instead of snoop. \n\nAlso, the partner was upset because the author didn't trust them. The author's actions could have been a breach of trust, even if the suspicion was right. So, while the outcome was that the author discovered the infidelity, the method used (snooping) is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, even if their intentions were to protect themselves.\n"
