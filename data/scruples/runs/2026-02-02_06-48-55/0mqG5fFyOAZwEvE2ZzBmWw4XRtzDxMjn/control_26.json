A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something and found he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then got yelled at for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Even if trust is an issue, going through someone's phone without permission is a breach of trust. The author mentions they did it because they had a strong feeling something was wrong, not just out of nosiness. They also contrast themselves with friends who snoop without reason. \n\nBut the key point here is consent. The author didn't ask for permission to check the phone. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping without consent might be seen as wrong. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling betrayed because of the lack of trust makes sense. Trust is a two-way street. If the author didn't trust, maybe communication was the better approach before taking such action.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to uncover the truth to prevent future heartbreak. They found out the cheating, which validated their suspicion. But does that justify the means? Some might argue that even if the outcome was good, the method was wrong. Others might say that in a situation of infidelity, the snooping was a way to get the truth they were being denied.\n\nIt's a bit of a dilemma. On one hand, privacy violation is a big deal. On the other, being cheated on is hurtful. The author's actions led to them leaving the situation, which might be the right decision for their well-being. But the method of finding out could still be considered wrong because it's about how you handle the relationship's trust issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the focus is on the action (snooping without consent), then yes, they are in the wrong. If the focus is on the outcome (avoiding future pain and uncovering infidelity), some might say no. But in most ethical frameworks, respecting privacy is important regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated their partner's privacy, even with good intentions.\n"
