A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who snooped through their partner's phone and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend was angry about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, checking someone's phone without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. But the author argues that they had a strong reason\u2014suspecting infidelity\u2014and that they were right. They also mention that they aren't pro-snooping without good reason, which differentiates their case from friends who do it out of nosiness.\n\nOn one hand, the act of snooping is a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason. It's about respecting boundaries. Even if the partner was cheating, the method of finding out might affect how the situation is handled. The boyfriend's anger about the privacy breach is a valid reaction. The author might have saved themselves heartbreak, but the means could be questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acted on a genuine concern and their intuition. The cheating was happening, so maybe the snooping was justified because it uncovered the betrayal. The author did confront the issue directly by leaving a note, which is more honest than just leaving without explanation. The question is whether the end (discovering the cheating) justifies the means (snooping).\n\nAlso, the cultural or societal norms might play a role. Some might say that in a relationship, partners have a right to know, and if trust is broken, the snooping is a way to find out. Others would argue that trust should be assumed, and snooping undermines that foundation. The author's reasoning is that they saved future heartbreak, which is a common argument in these situations.\n\nI need to weigh the violation of privacy against the harm of staying in a deceitful relationship. The author's actions led to an immediate resolution, but the method might still be wrong. It's a bit of a dilemma. Legally, there's no issue, but morally and ethically, it's debatable.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible to argue both sides. However, many ethical perspectives would emphasize the importance of consent and privacy, even in relationships. So the author might be in the wrong for violating the partner's privacy, even if their intentions were to uncover the truth. But others might see it as a justified action given the circumstances. The answer might depend on the prioritization of privacy vs. the right to know. I think the majority view would lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
