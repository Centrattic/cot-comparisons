A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend was acting distant, so they snooped through his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy, saying it showed a lack of trust. The author defends their actions by saying they had a good reason and that snooping to catch cheating is justified, unlike just being nosy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms around privacy in relationships. Generally, snooping in a partner's phone without consent is considered a violation of trust, even if the snooper's intention was to uncover infidelity. Trust is a crucial element in relationships, and breaking that by invading privacy can be seen as the wrong move, regardless of the outcome. Even if the person was being cheated on, the act of snooping without discussing it first might be seen as an overreach.\n\nBut the author argues that they had a valid reason and that their action saved them future heartbreak. The justification here is that the ends justify the means. However, in many perspectives, the means still matter. The boyfriend's privacy was violated, and the author's actions contributed to the conflict. The boyfriend's reaction is also important; he felt betrayed by the lack of trust, which could be a significant issue in a relationship, even if the cheating was happening.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend was already acting distant and the author had a genuine suspicion, some might argue that the situation is more nuanced. However, most advice would suggest confronting the issue through open communication rather than secretly snooping. The author's response of leaving without confrontation might also be seen as abrupt, though the cheating discovery complicates that.\n\nSo, weighing the intention (trying to protect themselves from future pain) against the method (breaking trust through snooping), the consensus might be that the author is in the wrong because they violated privacy, even with a good reason. The act of snooping is generally frowned upon, as it undermines trust, which is a foundational element of the relationship. Even if the outcome was that the author discovered the infidelity, the method used could be seen as ethically wrong.\n"
