A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation involves the boyfriend acting distant, the author finding out he's cheating by snooping, and then leaving a note before leaving. The boyfriend reacted angrily, saying she invaded his privacy and lacked trust. The author defends her actions by saying she did it out of genuine concern and to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and invading someone's privacy can be seen as a breach of that trust, even if the person being snooped is cheating. However, the author's intent was to uncover the truth because they suspected something was wrong, not just out of nosiness. Their friends snoop without reason, but the author had a specific concern based on their partner's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the action of snooping is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the result was that the partner was cheating, the method used might be seen as wrong. Relationships should be built on honesty and communication, and if the partner had come clean about the infidelity, the situation might have been handled differently. The author's preemptive action could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of addressing the issue through open dialogue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect themselves from ongoing emotional harm. They mention that they felt a gut feeling something was wrong, and their actions led to the truth. Arguably, they prioritized their well-being by ending the relationship quickly. The boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling them a \"piece of shit\" might indicate his own guilt or deflection.\n\nThe key points here are the violation of privacy versus self-preservation. Legally, snooping isn't a crime, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of the outcome (since the cheating partner was the one at fault), but the act itself is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions. If the focus is on the action (snooping), then yes, but if the focus is on the outcome (ending a cheating relationship), then maybe not.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both the action and the intent. Since the author had a legitimate concern and the cheating was confirmed, some might argue that the ends justified the means. Others might say that even if the intent was good, the method was wrong. There's also the aspect of the boyfriend's lack of communication and honesty, which could shift blame more onto him.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the primary wrong was the snooping or the cheating. If the author is in the wrong, it's for violating privacy. But if the boyfriend is in the wrong for cheating and not being honest, the author's action could be seen as justified. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer could be A (yes) if we focus on the act, or B (no) if we consider the justification. The community often leans towards A for snooping, but there's nuance here. However, the author's own stance is that they're not in the wrong, which is a common AITA conclusion when the person is righted by the situation (i.e., the cheater is the real asshole). So maybe the answer is B, but I need to check if the act of snooping itself is considered a wrong regardless of outcome.\n"
