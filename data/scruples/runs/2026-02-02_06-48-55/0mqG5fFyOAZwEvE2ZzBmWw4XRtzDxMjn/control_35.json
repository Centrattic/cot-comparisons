A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was distant, and after snooping, they found out he was cheating. The author left a note and then left, and the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion. The author justifies it by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical implications. Snooping into someone's phone without consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the intentions were to discover the truth, the method used is questionable. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and breaking that trust by snooping can cause damage regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author mentions that they are against casual snooping but justify their actions because they felt something was wrong. However, the key issue here is the lack of communication. Instead of confronting the partner about the distance and potential issues, they chose to snoop. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling that his privacy was invaded is valid. Even if the cheating was discovered, the method might have made the situation worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to prevent further emotional pain. They did leave a note and didn't confront the partner immediately, which might have been an attempt to handle it calmly. But the act itself is still a breach of trust. While the outcome might have been beneficial in ending a fraudulent relationship, the means used are ethically problematic.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. If there were concerns about the partner's behavior, discussing it directly would be the appropriate step. Snooping undermines that trust. Even if the cheating was established, the author's actions contributed to the breakdown of the relationship through dishonesty.\n\nSo weighing both sides, the act of snooping is generally considered wrong regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
