A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out he was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode. They felt a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong, so they looked through his phone while he was asleep. They found evidence of cheating, left a note, and then he yelled at them for invading privacy and lack of trust.\n\nThe key points here are the act of snooping without consent and the justification for doing so. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, snooping without his knowledge or permission is a violation of privacy. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and checking someone's phone without their consent can damage that trust, even if the snooper's intention was to uncover infidelity. The author might argue that they were protecting themselves from future heartbreak, but the action itself is ethically questionable because it's a breach of privacy regardless of the outcome. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is valid because snooping implies a lack of trust, which can be hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author also differentiates between snooping out of genuine concern and being nosy. But in ethical terms, the right to privacy isn't contingent on the snooper's intentions. So even if the result was beneficial, the action was a transgression. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A seems appropriate.\n"
