A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, but the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Snooping on someone's phone is generally a violation of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, going through the phone without consent is a breach of trust. The boyfriend mentioned he was in a depressive hole, which might explain his distant behavior, but that doesn't justify the cheating if it happened.\n\nThe author argues that they did it to prevent future heartbreak, which is a valid point. However, trust in a relationship is foundational. The boyfriend's reaction was anger about the privacy violation, not just the cheating. So the act of snooping itself is problematic, regardless of the outcome.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are against snooping unless there's a real reason, which they felt was the case here. But even with good intentions, the method was invasive. The question is whether the means justify the end. In relationships, communication is usually the expected approach. The author didn't confront the boyfriend directly even after finding out, which might have been a better step.\n\nSo, while the cheating is the boyfriend's fault, the act of snooping by the author is ethically questionable. Privacy violations can have consequences for trust. The author might have been justified in leaving after discovering the cheating, but the snooping itself is where they could be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation, even though the outcome was uncovering cheating.\n"
