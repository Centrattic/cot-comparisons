A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the infidelity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is privacy. The author snooped on their boyfriend's phone without his consent. Even though they had a suspicion something was wrong, the act of going through someone else's private devices is generally considered a violation of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, so breaking that by snooping could be seen as a mistake, even if the outcome was finding out the truth about cheating.\n\nThe author mentions that they didn't snoop out of mere nosiness but because they had a strong gut feeling something was wrong. They also argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak by discovering the cheating early. However, the means used to uncover the truth were invasive. Even if the result was the same (finding out about the infidelity), the method of discovery matters in terms of relationship ethics.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014yelling and saying the author never trusted him\u2014highlights the breach of trust. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by a desire to protect themselves, could have been avoided if they had approached the situation differently. For example, having an open conversation about the relationship issues instead of resorting to snooping might have been a better approach, even if it led to the same outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges that snooping without a valid reason is bad, which shows they understand the ethical line. But in this case, they justified it because they \"felt\" something was wrong. The problem is that everyone has the right to privacy, and the author's actions crossed that line regardless of the outcome.\n\nEven though the result was beneficial for the author (they left the situation), the act itself was ethically questionable. The author might argue that the ends justify the means, but in relationships, trust and respect are crucial. Violating someone's privacy, even in suspicion, can cause lasting damage. So, while the author might have been right to leave the relationship, the method of discovering the infidelity makes them at least partially at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
