A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, so they snooped through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion and accused the author of not trusting him.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't snoop out of nosiness but because they had a strong feeling something was wrong. They mention friends who snoop for no reason, but they're against that. They believe snooping was justified because it saved them future heartbreak.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Trust and privacy are key factors in relationships. Snooping without permission is a breach of trust, even if the motive is to protect oneself. The boyfriend felt that his privacy was violated, which is a valid concern. However, the author acted out of suspicion that turned out to be true. The outcome was finding out about the cheating, which is a betrayal in itself.\n\nBut the question is about whether the act of snooping was wrong, not the outcome. In relationships, mutual trust is essential. If the author didn't trust their partner, maybe that's a red flag that contributed to the cheating. However, the act of snooping is generally considered invasive and disrespectful. Even if the result was positive for the author, the method involved a breach of privacy. \n\nSome might argue that the author handled it better by leaving a note and not confronting him immediately, which prevented a more heated argument. But the initial act of snooping is still a violation. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is a valid point. So, even though the author found out the truth, the method was wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because snooping violates privacy, regardless of the outcome. Trust should be built, not broken through surveillance. Even if the cheating was real, the way the author found out is ethically questionable.\n"
