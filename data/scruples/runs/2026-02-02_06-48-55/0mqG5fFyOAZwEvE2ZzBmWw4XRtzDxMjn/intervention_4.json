A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for snooping on their partner's phone. They provided their own opinion that the author is in the wrong but want my thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are: the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, so they snooped and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he yelled at her for invading privacy. The author defends their actions by saying they acted because of a genuine suspicion, not just out of nosiness, and that they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible angles here are about trust, privacy, and betrayal. In relationships, trust is fundamental. Snooping into someone's phone usually violates that trust, regardless of the reason. Even if the suspicion was valid, the act of invading privacy without consent is generally considered wrong. However, the author's intention was based on concern and a legitimate fear, which complicates things. They argue they prevented more pain by acting, which might justify their actions in some eyes.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, respecting boundaries is important. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the right approach might have been to confront him directly instead of snooping. The author's action might be seen as a breach of trust, which can cause its own damage. The boyfriend's reaction (calling her a piece of shit) could be a result of feeling betrayed by her snooping, adding to the conflict.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Without mutual agreement on privacy boundaries, such actions can be problematic. While the author's intent was to uncover the truth, the method used was intrusive. Relationships require open communication, and snooping isn't a substitute for that. However, some might argue that when one partner is being deceptive (like hiding an affair), the other's options are limited, and snooping could be a last resort.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the ends don't always justify the means. Even if the outcome was positive (ending a deceptive relationship), the action of snooping still violates personal space and trust. The author might have felt justified, but from an external perspective, especially in a relationship where trust is supposed to be mutual, snooping undermines that foundation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action, while driven by concern, still constitutes a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, even if their intentions were to protect themselves.\n"
