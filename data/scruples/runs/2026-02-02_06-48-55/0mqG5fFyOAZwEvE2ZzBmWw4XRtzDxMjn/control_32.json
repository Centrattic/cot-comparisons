A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author had a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Instead of confronting him immediately, they left a note and left. The boyfriend called them a piece of shit for invading privacy and said it showed a lack of trust. The author defends their actions by saying they did it because they sensed something was really wrong, unlike friends who snoop out of nosiness. They argue they saved themselves heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, snooping through someone's phone without consent is generally considered a privacy violation. Even if the author had suspicions, accessing private messages without permission is an ethical issue. Trust is a big part of relationships, and the boyfriend felt that the snooping showed a lack of trust, which makes sense. However, the author's motivation was based on a genuine fear of infidelity, which they later confirmed. They might feel that the snooping was justified because it revealed the cheating, thus preventing future heartbreak.\n\nBut the problem here is the method. Instead of addressing the issue directly (like discussing the distance or asking more questions), they chose to invade his privacy. While the outcome was beneficial for the author, the action itself is ethically questionable. Privacy boundaries are important in relationships. Even if the intention was good, breaking into someone's phone breaches that trust. The boyfriend's reaction about being yelled at also shows the hurt caused by the snooping, regardless of the outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that they are different from friends who snoop for no reason might not fully justify their actions. The key issue is that trust should be the foundation of a relationship. If one feels the need to snoop, it could indicate underlying issues in communication. Maybe they should have addressed the distance first before resorting to snooping.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cheating is a betrayal, and the author had a right to know. But the method of finding out through snooping complicates things. Even if the cheating was happening, the way the author found out could be seen as their fault for not being honest from the start.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to protect themselves from future heartbreak, the act of snooping violates privacy and trust. The ethical standpoint here is that privacy should be respected, even if one suspects something wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
