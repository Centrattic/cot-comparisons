He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out.

I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode. They asked him and he said he was in a \"depressive hole,\" which is a sensitive topic. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they decided to snoop while he was asleep. They found evidence of him having a girlfriend on the side and then left a note before leaving. The boyfriend later called them a piece of shit for invading his privacy and accused them of not trusting him. The author defends their actions by saying they were trying to save future heartbreak and that they're not pro-snooping unless there's a real reason, unlike some friends who are just nosy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user opines that the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. The answer options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong).\n\nHmm, let's think about the ethics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if there was a suspicion of cheating, the right approach might have been to confront the partner directly, maybe with evidence or through open communication. The author's actions were based on a feeling, not on any concrete evidence. While they later found proof, the act of snoop itself is where the ethical issue lies. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is understandable because privacy is important. The author's decision to snoop might have been driven by concern, but it's still an invasion of privacy. The author also mentions they're against snooping unless there's a \"REALLY wrong\" reason, which suggests they see a line here. However, even if there's a reason, the method of going behind the partner's back could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to find out the truth early and avoid future heartbreak. They might argue that if the boyfriend had been honest, they wouldn't have had to snoop. But does that justify the action? Relationships should be built on mutual trust and honesty. If the boyfriend was unfaithful, that's his wrongdoing. However, the author's method of uncovering it\u2014without direct confrontation or trust\u2014might have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend cheated, the author's snooping was a breach of trust. Even if they ended up being right, the act of invading privacy isn't the right approach. The author should have addressed the issue through communication first, maybe by expressing their feelings and concerns rather than secretly checking the phone. \n\nAnother angle: the author's friends snoop for no reason, which the author opposes. But in this case, the author's reason was a suspicion that turned out to be correct. But the correctness of the suspicion doesn't make the snoop right. It's about the method and the respect for each other's privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is in the wrong because they violated their boyfriend's privacy, which is a significant issue in a relationship. Even though the outcome might have been justified in their eyes, the means used are ethically questionable. So the answer would be A.\n"
