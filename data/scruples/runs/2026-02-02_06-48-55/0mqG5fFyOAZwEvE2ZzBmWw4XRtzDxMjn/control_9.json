A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote theAITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and said he was in a depressive hole. The author decided to snoop through his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, then he called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy. The author argues that she did it because she had a gut feeling something was wrong and that she's against snooping for no reason. She believes she saved herself from heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nOn one hand, snooping through someone's phone without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and invading someone's privacy can be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend felt that the snoop proved she didn't trust him, which might be a valid perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason\u2014her partner was acting off, and she suspected cheating. Her action uncovered the infidelity, which led her to end the relationship, avoiding further heartbreak. She mentions she's against casual snooping but felt this was a justified case. \n\nSo, the dilemma is between privacy and the justification of uncovering infidelity. Different people might have different views here. Some might say that trust should be maintained even in suspicion, and that communication is better. Others might think that if a partner is already unfaithful, the snoop was necessary to uncover the truth.\n\nBut in most ethical frameworks, privacy is important. Even if the action led to a good outcome (discovering the cheat), the means might still be considered wrong. However, the context matters. If the relationship was already strained and there was a strong suspicion, some might be more lenient. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would say that snooping is wrong regardless of the outcome because it crosses a boundary. However, others might empathize with the author given the cheating. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and call her names, which could indicate his lack of accountability. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action of snooping is inherently wrong, regardless of the outcome. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that privacy invasion is typically frowned upon, the answer might be A (Yes). But considering the justification for uncovering infidelity, some might argue B (No). \n\nI need to balance these viewpoints. In most cases, even if the result is good, the act itself is seen as a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
