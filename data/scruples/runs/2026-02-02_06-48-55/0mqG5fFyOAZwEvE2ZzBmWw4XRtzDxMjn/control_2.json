A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the cheating. They want an answer A or B, nothing else.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person snoopeds their boyfriend's phone after sensing something was off. The boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The person found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe key points here: the author felt something was wrong, not just out of curiosity. They mention they're against snooping for no reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They justified it because they wanted to avoid future heartbreak. The boyfriend cheated, so his actions are also questionable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Privacy is important in relationships. Generally, snooping without permission violates trust. Even if there were reasons, it's still an invasion of privacy. However, the author had a legitimate reason to suspect cheating, which complicates it. The boyfriend's cheating is a betrayal, but the author's snooping led to the truth. \n\nIn many cases, cheating is considered a major wrongdoing, but the act of snooping is still ethically murky. Some might argue that the author had a right to know, especially if the partner wasn't forthcoming. Others would say that trust should be maintained through communication, not invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. Legally, maybe not wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The author's intent was to uncover the truth due to concerns, which might mitigate the wrongness. However, the act itself is still a breach of privacy. \n\nSince the user wants a binary answer, I need to decide. If the majority view is that snooping is wrong regardless of the reason, then A. But if the reason (preventing heartbreak from cheating) justifies it, then B. In many similar discussions, people often split, but the act of snooping is usually seen as wrong even if the outcome is justified. The boyfriend's cheating is bad, but the author's action is still considered wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
