A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and she found out he was cheating by checking his phone. She left a note and left, and he called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping on someone's phone is generally seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was to find out the truth, the method might be questionable. Trust is a big part of relationships, and checking someone's phone without their consent can damage that trust, even if the discovery is true.\n\nThe author mentions she felt something was wrong and couldn't ignore her gut feeling. She differentiates herself from friends who snoop out of nosiness. Her reasoning is that she wanted to prevent future heartbreak. But the question is whether the means justify the ends here.\n\nOn one hand, she found out the truth and possibly saved herself from more pain. On the other hand, she broke his trust by invading his privacy. There's also the fact that he confronted her and felt hurt, which adds to the emotional complexity.\n\nI need to weigh the violation of privacy against the consequences of the infidelity. If she had confronted him directly first, maybe they could have resolved it together, or maybe not. But she chose a different approach. Some people might argue that in a healthy relationship, partners should be open and honest, so sneaking around to check the phone isn't the right way to handle suspicion.\n\nHowever, others might say that when someone is being deceptive, it's understandable to take matters into one's own hands. But the act of snooping is still ethically dubious regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the question is about right and wrong in terms of actions, then snooping is generally wrong. Even if the result was good, the action itself is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
