A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of snooping itself. Generally, invading someone's privacy is a big no-no in relationships. Trust is a cornerstone, and checking a partner's phone without consent can be seen as a betrayal of that trust. Even if the motivation is suspicion, it's still a breach of privacy. The author mentions that they had a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong, which might justify it in their eyes, but the act itself is still questionable.\n\nThen, the outcome: the partner was indeed cheating. The author left and avoided further heartbreak. But the way they handled it\u2014leaving a note and not confronting the person immediately\u2014might be seen as cowardly. Also, the partner was angry because the snooping revealed the cheating, which the author might not have known otherwise. However, the author argues that they saved themselves future pain.\n\nThe key here is whether the means justify the ends. Even if the result was positive (discovering the infidelity), the method involved breaking trust. Relationships require mutual trust, and snooping undermines that. The author might have been right to want to know the truth, but the way they obtained it could be problematic. Also, the partner's reaction highlights the pain caused by the breach of privacy, which the author might not have considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the only one at fault. The boyfriend was cheating, which is the real betrayal. But the question is about the author's actions. In many moral frameworks, the act of snooping is still wrong regardless of the outcome. However, some might argue that in cases of suspected infidelity, the ends could justify the means. It's a tricky balance.\n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the privacy violation, even though the discovery was valid. Trust issues should be addressed through communication, not snooping. The author's actions might have been a result of their own insecurities or lack of trust, which is a problem in the relationship. So the answer is likely A.\n"
