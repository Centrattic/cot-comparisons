A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled at them for invading privacy and said it proves they didn't trust him. The author defends their actions by saying they weren't being nosy, just had a strong feeling, and that snooping saved them from future heartbreak.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. They want a simple A or B answer, but I need to make sure I understand the nuances. \n\nTrust is a big part of any relationship. Snooping through a partner's phone without permission is definitely a breach of privacy. Even if the author had a suspicion, doing so covertly might not be the best approach. The boyfriend had already mentioned he was feeling down, which the author might have taken as an issue to address through communication rather than invading his privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author found evidence of cheating, which is a serious betrayal. They argue that they prevented future pain by acting on their suspicion. But the act of snooping itself is ethically questionable. Trust issues should ideally be handled through open dialogue, not by secretly checking devices. \n\nThe author mentions they're against snooping for no reason, but in this case, there was a reason. However, the justification of \"saving heartbreak\" doesn't necessarily negate the wrongdoing in the action. The boyfriend felt betrayed by the lack of trust, which is valid. Even if he was cheating, the method of discovery matters. \n\nIn relationships, how you handle issues can affect the trust and respect between partners. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the outcome, still involved a breach of privacy. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because snooping is a violation of privacy and trust, even if it led to a justified outcome. The right approach would have been to talk openly and address the concerns directly, not through secret surveillance.\n"
