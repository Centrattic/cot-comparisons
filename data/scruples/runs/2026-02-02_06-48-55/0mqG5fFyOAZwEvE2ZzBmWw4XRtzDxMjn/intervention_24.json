A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author felt something was wrong and decided to snoop through his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and said it shows a lack of trust. The author defends their actions by saying they did it because they sensed something was really wrong and that they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, snooping through someone's phone without consent is a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and doing something like that can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the other person is cheating. The boyfriend did confront the author, which might indicate that he values his privacy. The author's action might have been driven by suspicion, but it's still an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a reason to be concerned. The boyfriend was distant and hiding something, leading to valid suspicions. The author found out the truth, which might have been painful to discover, but it allowed them to end the relationship before more harm. The author also distinguishes their action from friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they don't support. They see it as a necessary step to protect themselves.\n\nSo the main ethical dilemma here is between privacy and trust. In a healthy relationship, open communication is key. Instead of snooping, the author might have been better off addressing the behavior and asking for honesty. However, in a situation where the partner is already being dishonest (cheating), the author's action might be seen as a last resort.\n\nBut even so, snooping is a violation. Even if the intention was to uncover the truth, the method is a breach of trust. The boyfriend was upset because of the privacy invasion, which is a valid response. The author might have been justified in ending the relationship, but the means of finding out the truth might still be wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. Legally and ethically, invasion of privacy is wrong regardless of the reason. So the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the outcome was that they left the relationship. The action itself was a breach, and while the intention was to discover the truth, the method is still problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
