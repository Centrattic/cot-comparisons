A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and the author found out he was cheating by checking his phone while he was asleep. The author then left a note and left, and the boyfriend was angry about the privacy invasion.\n\nSo, the user wants me to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping on a partner's phone is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if there's suspicion of cheating, invading someone's privacy without their consent is typically seen as wrong. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can break that trust, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author argues that they had a good reason because they found out about the cheating. But the act itself\u2014snooping\u2014still violates privacy. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted makes sense because the act of snooping, regardless of the result, shows a lack of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because they uncovered the infidelity and ended the relationship early. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong. Legally, snooping on a partner's phone might not be illegal, but ethically, it's questionable. \n\nThe author also contrasts themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they disapprove of. However, their own action, even with a \"good\" reason, still falls into the category of unethical snooping. The key point is that the means (snooping) are wrong regardless of the ends (discovering cheating). Even if the outcome was bad, the action itself is still a violation.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping without consent breaches trust and privacy, even if it led to discovering the truth.\n"
