A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author snooped through their boyfriend's phone, found out he was cheating, and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading his privacy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, consider the act of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy without consent is seen as a violation of trust, even in relationships. The author mentions they have friends who snoop out of nosiness, but they did it because they had a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong. The boyfriend was indeed cheating, so her actions led to uncovering the truth.\n\nBut the moral aspect here is tricky. On one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and finding out the truth can be necessary for the author's well-being. On the other hand, snooping is a breach of privacy. The author's justification is that they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and they felt it was justified because their boyfriend wasn't being honest. However, the boyfriend's reaction was anger over the privacy invasion, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key point is whether the means (snooping) were wrong regardless of the outcome. Even if the result was uncovering infidelity, the act of snooping without consent is typically considered a breach of trust. Relationships are built on mutual respect and trust, and breaking that can cause significant damage. The author might argue self-preservation, but the method used could be seen as ethically wrong, regardless of the outcome. So, while the cheating is the boyfriend's fault, the snoop itself is where the author's wrongdoing lies. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
