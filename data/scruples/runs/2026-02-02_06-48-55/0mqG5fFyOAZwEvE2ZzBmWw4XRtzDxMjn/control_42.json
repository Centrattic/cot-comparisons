A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who asked the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so they snooped and found evidence of cheating. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend called them a piece of shit for invading his privacy. The author justifies it by saying they prevented future heartbreak and that they aren't nosy like friends who snoop for no reason.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether snooping is justified. Ethically, invading someone's privacy is generally considered wrong unless there's a very compelling reason. In relationships, trust is a cornerstone. If you don't trust your partner, that can be a problem. But on the other hand, if there are legitimate reasons to believe something's wrong, maybe it's understandable.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Legally, there might not be much to say, but morally and socially, snooping without consent is a breach of trust. The boyfriend is upset because he feels the privacy was violated, and he's defending his actions by saying he was in a depressive state, maybe trying to make it seem worse. The author might feel justified because they found out about the cheating and ended things to avoid more pain.\n\nHowever, the method of discovering the infidelity through snooping is what's being questioned. Even if the outcome was the truth coming out, the means were invasive. The partner might have wanted to address the issues without the betrayal, but that's speculative. The author's friends snoop for no reason, but the author claims they had a good reason here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, then yes. If B, no. Different perspectives: some might say trust is key and snooping is a breach, making the author wrong. Others might empathize with the author's situation, seeing the cheating as the real issue. But the act of snooping itself is typically frowned upon regardless of the outcome. Even if the result was positive, the action is still considered a violation. So the answer might be A.\n"
