He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author felt a gut feeling that something was wrong, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Instead of confronting him immediately, they left a note and left. The boyfriend then called them out for invading privacy and not trusting him. The author defends their action because they felt it was necessary to prevent future heartbreak, unlike friends who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether snooping was justified. Trust is a big part of any relationship. Sneaking into someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if the author had a reason, like suspecting infidelity, it's still an invasion of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted makes sense because snooping can be seen as a lack of trust. However, the author's point is that they wanted to save themselves future pain by finding out the truth early. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the author might feel justified in wanting to know the truth. On the other hand, using snooping as a method to find out could have caused additional hurt. If the author had approached the boyfriend directly and expressed their concerns, maybe they could have addressed the issue without betraying his trust. But in this case, the boyfriend was already cheating, so maybe the author's direct approach would have been confrontational. \n\nThe author also mentions they are against snooping for no reason, which shows they distinguish between their case and others'. However, the act itself is still a violation of privacy. Even if the outcome was good (the author found out the truth and left), the method used is ethically questionable. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Snooping undermines trust, and while the author might have had a valid suspicion, the method of investigation could be seen as wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he felt his privacy was invaded. Even if he was cheating, the fact that the author didn't trust him enough to confront the issue directly instead of snooping could be a problem. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action of snooping is ethically in the wrong because it breaches privacy, even if the outcome was beneficial. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But some might argue it's justified because they prevented future heartbreak. However, the consensus in many ethical discussions points towards respecting privacy as important regardless of the outcome. So I think the answer is A.\n"
