A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a romantic partner snooping through their boyfriend's phone after suspecting something's wrong, which turned out to be infidelity. The author defends their actions by saying they did it to avoid future heartbreak and that it was justified because they felt something was really wrong, unlike friends who snoop for no reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Snooping into someone's phone is generally considered an invasion of privacy. Even if the motive is to uncover infidelity, it's a breach of trust. The boyfriend did cheat, but the act of snooping without consent is still a violation. The author's justification doesn't negate the action's wrongness. \n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. By snooping, the author broke that trust, which might have led to the argument and the breakup. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling betrayed makes sense because privacy is important. Even if the outcome was that the author left the relationship, the method involved deceit. \n\nHowever, some might argue that cheating is a betrayal of trust, so the author's actions were a response to that. But the problem is the method used. The author could have confronted the boyfriend directly instead of resorting to snooping. \n\nThe author mentions not wanting to cause more heartbreak, but their actions might have exacerbated the situation. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the cheating was discovered, the act of snooping is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether privacy violations are justifiable under suspicion of betrayal. In most ethical frameworks, consent is key. Without consent, snooping is wrong regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
