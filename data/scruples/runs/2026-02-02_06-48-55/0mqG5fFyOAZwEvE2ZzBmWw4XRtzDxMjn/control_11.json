A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the affair. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is considered wrong, even if the reasons are justified. Trust is a crucial component in a relationship, and snooping can be seen as a violation of that trust. The author admits they did it because they had a gut feeling something was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nThe boyfriend was cheating, which is definitely wrong on his part. However, the act of snooping itself is a separate issue. The author's friends snoop for no reason, but they differentiate by saying they do it when they sense something's really wrong. Still, the method of uncovering the infidelity through snooping might be problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend reacted by yelling and saying the author didn't trust him. This suggests that the snooping breached his privacy. Even if the outcome was the discovery of a betrayal, the means used to uncover it could be seen as unethical. The author might have handled the situation differently by confronting the boyfriend directly instead of going through his phone. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect themselves from further heartbreak. They believe they saved themselves from a longer period of distress. In some perspectives, the ends might justify the means, but in terms of right and wrong, the act of snooping is still a violation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate their suspicions directly but chose to snoop instead. This could have led to a different outcome if they had discussed their concerns openly. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend is clearly in the wrong for cheating, the author's actions might still be considered wrong due to the invasion of privacy. However, the context of the cheating might mitigate the wrongdoing. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering standard ethical viewpoints, privacy violations are generally considered wrong regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that the cheating makes it less of an issue. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not who is more wrong. Since the act of snooping is a breach of privacy, the author is in the wrong, so the answer should be A.\n"
