A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see, the situation is about snooping through their partner's phone. The boyfriend was acting distant, and the author, after being told it was depression, decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, respecting someone's privacy is important in a relationship. Even if there are suspicions, invading privacy might not be the right approach. But the author mentions they had a gut feeling something was wrong, not just being nosy. They also contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they disapprove of.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the author ended a relationship that was going to cause future heartbreak. They might feel justified because they acted on a legitimate concern. On the other hand, trust is a cornerstone of relationships. By snooping, the author didn't trust their partner, which led to the breakup. The boyfriend felt the privacy violation was a deeper issue than the cheating itself.\n\nDifferent perspectives here. Some might say that if there's a valid reason to suspect infidelity, it's understandable. Others would argue that trust should be assumed unless there's concrete evidence, and snooping undermines that trust. Also, the method of confrontation\u2014leaving a note instead of discussing it\u2014might affect the situation. But the main issue is the act of snooping itself.\n\nI think it's a tricky situation. While the outcome (ending a cheating relationship) is positive, the means (snooping) could be seen as wrong because it breaches trust. Relationships require mutual trust and respect for privacy. Even if the cheating was happening, the act of invading privacy might not be justifiable. So, the author's actions could be considered wrong regardless of the outcome. But others might side with them because they acted on their instincts to protect themselves. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since privacy invasion is generally frowned upon, even in cases of suspected cheating, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
