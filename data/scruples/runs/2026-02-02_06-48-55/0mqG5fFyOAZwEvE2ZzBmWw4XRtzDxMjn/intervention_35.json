A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, and ended up finding evidence of cheating. The author left a note and then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of snooping. Generally, snooping without permission is a breach of privacy. Even if the person has a valid reason, like suspecting cheating, it's still a violation of trust. Relationships are built on mutual trust, and if that's broken, the person might feel justified in checking. But the act itself is still a breach of privacy.\n\nThe author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping for no reason, unlike friends who do it out of nosiness. They believe their action was justified because they had a strong feeling something was wrong. However, the boyfriend felt that the snooping proved a lack of trust, which is a valid point. Trust is a two-way street; if one partner feels the need to snoop, it can damage the relationship regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they saved themselves future heartbreak. Cheating is a significant betrayal, and finding out early could prevent more pain. However, the method of finding out through snooping versus confronting the partner directly is a key issue. Confrontation is uncomfortable, but snooping without evidence can lead to accusations without basis. In this case, the author did find evidence, which supports their suspicion, but the means are still questionable.\n\nLegal perspectives might not be as relevant here as ethical ones, but generally, in relationships, both parties should have the right to privacy. Unless there's a legal context (like child custody issues), privacy in a relationship is more about mutual respect. The boyfriend's reaction about lack of trust makes sense because snooping, regardless of the outcome, indicates a failure to trust him.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author felt justified because they discovered the infidelity, but the act of snooping might have caused more immediate pain. The boyfriend felt hurt because his privacy was invaded, which adds to the conflict. Even if the outcome was the same (realizing the relationship was over), the method could have affected how things ended.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author should have addressed the distance and depressive mood first. Maybe open communication could have led to the truth without snooping. However, the author felt that their gut feeling was right, and the evidence confirmed their suspicion. But that doesn't negate the ethical issue of the snooping itself.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent and the result (finding out about the cheating) might be seen as understandable, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy and trust. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of trust in relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the method used to uncover the infidelity was inappropriate, even if the outcome was justified.\n"
