A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair. The options are A (yes) or B (no). My job is to figure out which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, a partner in a relationship, noticed their boyfriend was distant and seemed depressed. They didn't trust him, so they snooped his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Then they left a note and left, and he later yelled at them for invading privacy and said it showed a lack of trust.\n\nThe author defends their actions by saying they felt it was justified because they had a gut feeling something was wrong. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness, implying their reason was valid. They argue that they saved themselves from future heartbreak by acting on their suspicions, even though they admit snooping is usually wrong unless there's a real reason.\n\nSo, the key points here are: trust, privacy, and the justification of the snooping. The main ethical question is whether the ends (discovering the infidelity) justify the means (snooping without consent). \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner feels the need to snoop, that already indicates a breakdown in trust. The author's actions might be seen as a violation of privacy, which is a serious issue. Even if the outcome was bad (cheating), the method of finding out might be considered unethical. Some people believe that respecting each other's privacy is crucial, even in the face of suspicion. Others might argue that when trust is already compromised, and there's suspicion of betrayal, seeking the truth becomes a priority, and the method is a necessary evil.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction of yelling and calling the author a \"piece of shit\" doesn't justify the snooping. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act itself (snooping without consent) is generally considered a breach of privacy, regardless of the outcome. Even if the author had a valid reason, the action was a violation. The author might argue that they were protecting themselves, but the method could still be seen as the wrong choice.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend was already cheating, some might say the author was right to uncover the truth and end the relationship. However, the act of snooping is still ethically questionable. It's a bit of a gray area, but the consensus often leans towards the fact that privacy should be respected, even in suspicion. The author's justification that they did it to avoid future heartbreak might not excuse the violation of trust and privacy. \n\nSo, considering these points, even though the outcome was bad, the act of snooping is generally considered wrong in most ethical frameworks. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
