A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about the affair. So, first, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here.\n\nThe author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had been in a depressive hole. The author had a gut feeling something was wrong, so they snooped while he was asleep. They found evidence of cheating. Then they left a note and left. The boyfriend was angry, saying it was a privacy violation and that it showed a lack of trust. \n\nNow, the author justifies the snooping because they had a strong suspicion and it led to uncovering infidelity. They argue that it saved future heartbreak. But the issue here is about privacy and trust. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy. Trust is a two-way street in a relationship. If the boyfriend felt the need to cheat, that's his fault, but the author's action of invading his privacy might have been wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nSome might say that if someone is cheating, it's not the snooper's fault for trying to find out the truth. But others might argue that trust is essential, and without it, the relationship was already on shaky ground. The author's actions, while leading to a negative outcome for the boyfriend, might still be considered a violation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of justification. The author isn't just being nosy; they had a reason. But does that make it okay? In many ethical discussions, privacy is a right. Even if you suspect wrongdoing, invading someone's privacy isn't typically seen as acceptable. However, the context matters. If the partner was deceptive and the author felt betrayed, maybe the action is more understandable. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Legally, snooping through a partner's phone might not be illegal, but morally, it's a gray area. The boyfriend's cheating is definitely wrong, but the author's action is still a violation. So, while both parties have issues, the author's action is a breach of trust and privacy, which would make them at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the partner's privacy, even if their suspicions were correct. The means of finding out the truth don't justify the method in terms of moral rightness.\n"
