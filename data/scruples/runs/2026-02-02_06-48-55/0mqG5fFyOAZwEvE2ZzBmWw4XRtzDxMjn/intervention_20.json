A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a person who snooped through their partner's phone and found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then he called and yelled at them. The author justifies their actions by saying they had a gut feeling something was wrong and that snooping in this case was justified because it led to saving future heartbreak. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they're against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is a big no-no, even in relationships. Trust is a key component, and using deception to check on the other person can erode that trust. The author argues that it was necessary to prevent more harm, but the method still involved a breach of privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. He felt that the snooping proved the author didn't trust him, which adds to the tension. Even if the author had a valid reason, the act itself might have been a violation of consent. The question is whether the ends justify the means here.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel vindicated because the snooping revealed the cheating, which would have been hurtful if discovered later. On the other hand, the act of snooping without consent is a breach of privacy. It's possible that open communication could have addressed the issue without the need for snooping. The author might have acted out of fear or insecurity, which is understandable, but it's still a violation.\n\nAlso, relationships are built on mutual trust. If the author had approached the situation with open dialogue instead of snooping, maybe they could have resolved the issue differently. The fact that the boyfriend was already distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole might have been a sign to address the emotional issues rather than immediately suspecting infidelity.\n\nBut then again, sometimes people do things to protect themselves, and if the author sensed something was off, maybe they felt it was the only way to get the truth. However, that doesn't necessarily make the action right. The author's friends who snoop for no reason are clearly wrong, but this case is different because there was a reason. Still, the act of snooping is a gray area.\n\nUltimately, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, invading privacy is wrong, regardless of the outcome. Even if the result was beneficial (finding out about the cheating), the method was unethical. However, some might argue that in cases of suspected betrayal, the person has a right to seek the truth, especially if the partner is being deceptive.\n\nBut the key here is that the author chose to snoop instead of confronting the issue directly. The boyfriend was already acting distant and mentioned depression, so maybe the author should have given him space or communicated more rather than resorting to snooping. The fact that the author left a note and didn't confront him face-to-face might have been a mistake, leading to the boyfriend's anger.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, even if their intentions were to uncover the truth. The action itself is a breach of trust and consent, which is a significant ethical issue. The outcome was negative, but the act of snooping is still morally questionable."
