A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to decide whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a partner who noticed their boyfriend acting distant. The boyfriend mentioned being in a depressive hole, but the author felt something was off. They snooped through the phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and said it showed lack of trust. The author defends their actions, saying they acted because they had a real reason, unlike friends who snoop out of nosiness. They argue they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, the act of snooping is a privacy violation. Even if the boyfriend was acting off, the author didn't ask for permission to check his phone. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can be seen as breaking that trust. The boyfriend felt betrayed because the author didn't trust him, which led to the cheating and the subsequent conflict. The author might think they had a valid reason, but intentionally violating privacy is usually considered wrong regardless of the outcome. However, the cheating was a betrayal as well. So there's a conflict here between the right to privacy vs. the right to know about infidelity. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the boyfriend cheated, the act of snooping is ethically questionable. Relationships require mutual trust, and if trust is broken from either side, it's problematic. The author's action might have been a response to the boyfriend's betrayal, but the act itself is still a violation. So the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong). But maybe some might argue it's justified given the outcome. However, generally, snooping without consent is considered wrong.\n"
