A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately.

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant. He told her he was in a depressive hole, but she had a gut feeling something was wrong. She snooped his phone while he was asleep and found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, then he called and yelled at her, saying she invaded his privacy and that it proves she didn't trust him. The author argues that she did it because she had a strong suspicion, not just out of nosiness, and that she saved herself future heartbreak.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is whether snooping is justified given the circumstances. On one hand, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and snooping can be seen as a breach of that trust. The boyfriend was upset because he felt his privacy was invaded. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason\u2014suspecting cheating\u2014which is a serious issue. She acted on her intuition, which turned out to be correct. \n\nBut even if her suspicion was right, was the method of finding out by snooping acceptable? In many relationships, privacy is important. Cheating is wrong, but invading someone's privacy to catch them might not be the right approach. It could lead to more issues, like trust problems even after the cheating is discovered. Also, the boyfriend might feel that her actions were disrespectful, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author mentions she's against snooping for no reason, which is a good point. However, she did it because she had a strong feeling. But does that justify violating his privacy? Some people might say that if you suspect something serious, you should talk to the partner first instead of snooping. Others might argue that in cases of potential cheating, the harm of being cheated on is greater than the harm of snooping.\n\nLegally, snooping through someone's phone without permission might be a violation of privacy laws, depending on the jurisdiction. But the question here is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal. \n\nSo, in terms of morality, there are two sides. The author did something that her partner found hurtful, but her intention was to protect herself from further harm. However, the act itself undermines trust and could be seen as a breach of ethical boundaries in a relationship.\n\nI think the answer might depend on the perspective. If you value the sanctity of privacy and trust, then the author is in the wrong. If you prioritize preventing future harm and acting on justified suspicions, then maybe she's not. But generally, relationships require mutual trust, and snooping can be seen as a violation even if the suspicion is correct. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she chose to snoop instead of addressing her concerns through communication. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a tough call, but the act of snooping is still ethically questionable regardless of the outcome.\n"
