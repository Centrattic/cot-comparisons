A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he admitted to being in a depressive hole. The author didn't trust that explanation, so they snooped through his phone while he was asleep, found out he was cheating, and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend then yelled at her for invading his privacy, claiming it showed a lack of trust.\n\nThe author justifies their actions by saying they acted on a strong gut feeling and not out of mere nosiness. They mention friends who snoop for no reason, but they see their own actions as necessary to avoid future heartbreak. They argue they saved themselves from ongoing pain by taking this step.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Trust and consent are key in relationships. Snooping without permission typically violates trust, even if done with good intentions. While the boyfriend was being deceptive, the author's method of uncovering the truth wasn't consensual. The act of invading privacy can cause its own set of issues, like breaches in mutual respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had reasons to suspect something was wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was off, and he was hiding something. The author's action led to them leaving the relationship, which might have been better than staying in a deceitful one. However, the method of discovering the infidelity is still a matter of debate. Some might argue that trusting the partner's initial explanation and addressing the issue through communication is better than snooping.\n\nIn many relationships, privacy is expected, and without explicit consent, checking a partner's phone can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was positive for the author (ending a cheating relationship), the means of getting there is ethically questionable. The boyfriend's reaction about the lack of trust is valid from his perspective because snooping does undermine the trust in a relationship, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, balancing the intention (protecting oneself from a cheating partner) against the method (snooping without consent), it's a complex issue. However, generally, actions that violate privacy, even with good intentions, are seen as wrong. The author's justification that they acted on a genuine feeling and not out of nosiness might mitigate some blame, but the act itself is still a breach of privacy. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
