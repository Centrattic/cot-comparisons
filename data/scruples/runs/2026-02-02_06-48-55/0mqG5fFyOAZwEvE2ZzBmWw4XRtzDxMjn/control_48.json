      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author felt uneasy and decided to check his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then he called them a piece of shit for invading privacy and said it proves they didn't trust him. The author justifies it by saying they saved themselves future heartbreak and that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a real reason.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is privacy vs. trust. Cheating is a big deal, and the author did find evidence of it. But did they overstep by snooping? Trust is a two-way street. If the partner felt the need to check the phone, does that mean trust was already compromised? Also, the method they used\u2014snooping without confronting the partner first\u2014might be problematic. Even if the partner was cheating, approaching the situation differently might have been better, like having an honest conversation once they noticed the behavior. \n\nBut the author did have a valid reason. They weren't just being nosy; they had a gut feeling something was wrong. Cheating is a serious betrayal, and the author's actions led to uncovering the truth. However, invading someone's privacy, regardless of the reason, is generally considered a violation. Even if the outcome was good (finding out about the cheating), the means might still be seen as wrong. \n\nThe partner's reaction of yelling and calling them a piece of shit is also a reflection of his own behavior. If he was cheating, his reaction is hypocritical. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIn some perspectives, trust is essential in a relationship, and snooping undermines that trust. But if there are signs of infidelity, some might argue that protecting oneself is necessary. It's a balance between respecting privacy and self-preservation. \n\nThe author also mentions friends who snoop for no reason, which they disapprove of. So they differentiate between justified and unjustified snooping. Their reasoning is that they had a valid concern. \n\nSo, is it AITA? Depending on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might say the ends justify the means, others that the action was still wrong. But relationships often require mutual trust. If the author didn't trust, maybe the relationship was already on shaky ground. However, the act of snooping is still a breach of privacy, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the outcome was discovering cheating, the act of snooping is a breach of trust and privacy. However, others might argue the opposite. But in most ethical discussions, respecting a partner's privacy is important, and snooping is generally frowned upon even if there's suspicion.\n"
