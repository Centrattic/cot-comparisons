A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author snooped through their boyfriend's phone and found out he was cheating, then left a note and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion. The author justifies it by saying they did it to avoid future heartbreak and aren't doing it out of nosiness like some friends.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if snooping is inherently wrong in a relationship. Trust is a big part of relationships. If one partner is sneaking around, that could be a breach of trust. The boyfriend is upset because he feels his privacy was violated. But on the other hand, the author found out about the cheating, which is a betrayal. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they did it to prevent more pain. But does that justify the action? Some might argue that even if the other person is cheating, invading privacy isn't the right way to handle it. Others might say that when there's a suspicion of cheating, it's understandable to want to know the truth, even if it's done secretly.\n\nThe author also mentions they aren't like the friends who snoop out of nosiness. So, their motivation is based on concern, not just curiosity. However, the method of finding out (snooping) is still a violation. The boyfriend feels that the author's action proves a lack of trust, which is a valid feeling. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't approach the situation by talking to the boyfriend directly, which could have been the healthier approach. Instead, they took matters into their own hands, which could be seen as impulsive. Even though the outcome was the truth, the method might still be considered wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the ends justify the means. If the author had communicated their concerns first, maybe they could have addressed the issue without snooping. Since they didn't, it's a breach of privacy regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
