A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about a cheating. The author justifies it by saying they had a gut feeling and saved themselves future heartbreak, but the partner was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Trust is a big part of a relationship. Cheating is obviously wrong, but does that justify snooping? The author mentions friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they oppose. So they think their reason was valid because they had a feeling something was off. But in most cases, invading someone's privacy, even in a relationship, is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. The partner was upset because of the privacy violation, not just the cheating itself. \n\nThen there's the question of consent. The partner didn't give permission for the phone to be checked. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping without consent can be seen as a violation. Relationships require mutual trust, and if there's a suspicion of cheating, communication is usually the recommended approach, not going behind their back. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect themselves from prolonged heartbreak. They found out the truth, which allowed them to leave the relationship. But the method they used caused immediate conflict. The partner felt betrayed by the snooping, which might have been more hurtful than the cheating itself. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while cheating is morally wrong, the act of spying on a partner is often frowned upon because it's a breach of privacy. Even if the outcome was good (finding out about the cheating), the means were questionable. The author might have handled the situation better by confronting the partner directly instead of snooping. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated their partner's privacy, even though the outcome was justified. The method used to uncover the cheating was ethically problematic.\n"
