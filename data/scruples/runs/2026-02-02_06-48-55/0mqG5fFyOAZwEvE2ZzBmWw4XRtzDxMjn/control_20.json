A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately.

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned he was in a depressive hole. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong, so she checked his phone while he was asleep. She found out he was cheating. She left a note and left, and then he yelled at her for invading his privacy, saying it proved she didn't trust him.\n\nFirst, the act of snooping itself. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if you have suspicions, going through someone's phone without their consent is usually considered a breach of trust. But then again, the author had a reason to suspect something was wrong beyond just being distant. The boyfriend's depression could be a valid reason for his behavior, but the author felt the need to check.\n\nThe author mentions they have friends who snoop for no reason, but she believes it's okay when you have a strong feeling something's wrong. That's a common argument. However, even if there's a reason, the method of checking without consent is problematic. Trust is foundational in a relationship, and this action might have broken that trust, even if it revealed the truth.\n\nHe called her a piece of shit, which is harsh, but maybe he felt violated. She left a note instead of confronting him immediately. That might have been an attempt to avoid an emotional confrontation, but maybe she should have talked to him first. However, she might have been too upset to do that.\n\nThe outcome was that she discovered the cheating, which she's glad she did. She saved herself potential heartbreak. But is that justification enough? The question is about whether she was in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but ethically? It's a gray area. Some might say that if there were signs of cheating, it's understandable. Others would say that privacy should never be invaded regardless.\n\nIn relationships, trust is supposed to be there without needing to check up on each other. If trust is absent, maybe that's an issue in the relationship. But if one person is acting suspiciously, it's hard to say. The author had a valid reason to feel something was off, but the method of checking might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the act of snooping is generally wrong, but the context of potential cheating might mitigate some of the blame. However, the fact that she didn't confront him directly and left, leading to a yelling match, might complicate things. The boyfriend's reaction was also harsh, which could be his fault, but the initial act of snooping is still questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, while her actions might be understandable given the situation, the act of snooping without consent is ethically wrong. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
