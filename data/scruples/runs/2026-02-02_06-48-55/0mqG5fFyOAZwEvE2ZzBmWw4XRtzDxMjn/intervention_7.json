A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for snooping through their boyfriend's phone and discovering he was cheating. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the ethical angle. Snooping into someone's private phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust and communication are foundational in relationships. Even if the author had a suspicion, the act of checking the phone without discussing it first could be seen as betrayal of trust. The boyfriend felt that his privacy was invaded, which is a valid reaction.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was based on a legitimate concern. They noticed their partner acting distant and had a gut feeling something was wrong. The discovery of cheating might validate their suspicion. But the method they used\u2014snooping\u2014could have been avoided if they had addressed the issue openly. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author's actions led to them leaving the relationship, which they see as preventing further heartbreak.\n\nNow, considering the consequences. The author left, which might be justified given the cheating. But the act of snooping without communication first might have escalated the situation. The boyfriend's reaction was anger and feeling that trust was broken, which complicates the situation. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author truly trusted their partner, they might have brought up the issue first. Cheating is a betrayal, but the method of discovering it can also affect how the situation is handled. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is against casual snooping and only did it because they had a strong reason. They might argue that the ends justified the means. But in ethical terms, the means matter. Even with good intentions, violating privacy can be wrong.\n\nSo, while the cheating is a serious issue, the act of snooping without communication first could be seen as the author's fault. They broke trust through their actions, even if the outcome revealed the cheating. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes), the author is in the wrong for snooping, even if the reason was valid.\n"
