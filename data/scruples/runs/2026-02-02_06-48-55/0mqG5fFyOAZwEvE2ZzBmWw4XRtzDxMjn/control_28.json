A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after some snooping, the author found out he was cheating. Now the boyfriend is upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is a big no-no. Even if there's a suspicion of cheating, going through someone's phone without consent is a breach of trust. The author mentions they had a gut feeling something was wrong, but that doesn't justify the action. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and if you don't trust, there might be valid reasons, but the way to address it is communication, not snooping.\n\nThe author also differentiates between their case and friends who snoop out of nosiness. They think their reason is justified because they felt something was really wrong. However, the key issue here is consent. Even if the boyfriend was cheating, the act of snoop still violates his privacy. The author might have left a note and left, which could be seen as mature, but the initial action is still problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions did lead to uncovering the cheating, which might have saved them from future heartbreak. But the question is about being in the wrong. Legally and ethically, snooping without permission is wrong regardless of the outcome. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is valid because trust is broken when privacy is invaded without discussion.\n\nSo, even though the outcome was beneficial for the author, the means were unethical. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the act of snooping is a violation of privacy and trust, regardless of the intentions or results.\n"
