A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the partner was acting distant, and after snooping, the author discovered the partner was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the partner yelled at them for invading privacy. The author justifies it by saying they saved themselves future heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. Snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the author had suspicions, accessing private information without permission is a breach of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and if the partner felt the need to hide something, that's a red flag, but the author's method of addressing it was invasive.\n\nThe author mentions they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they had. However, the act itself is still a violation. The partner's reaction\u2014being upset about the privacy invasion\u2014is understandable. Even if the result was uncovering a betrayal, the means might still be wrong. Some might argue that the ends justify the means here, but others would say that the method of discovery damages the relationship's trust foundation.\n\nAlso, the author's justification of \"saving\" themselves from heartbreak is valid in a way\u2014they avoided prolonged emotional pain. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong. Ethically, the act of snooping is contentious. Legally, it might depend on jurisdiction, but morally, it's about respecting personal boundaries. \n\nAlternatives could have been confronting the partner directly or seeking counseling. However, the author might not have felt safe or confident in those approaches. Still, the decision to snoop is a personal one, but it's generally viewed as wrong to violate privacy, even with good intentions. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author acted unethically by snooping, even if it led to a positive outcome. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
