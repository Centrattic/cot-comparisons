A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, and they found out he was cheating by checking his phone while he was asleep. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and said it shows a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping in a relationship. Generally, trust is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship. If one partner is sneaking around and looking through the other's phone without permission, that's usually seen as a breach of trust. Even if the motive is to uncover something harmful like cheating, the act of snooping without consent can be problematic. \n\nThe author argues that they acted out of concern and that it saved them from future heartbreak. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop for no reason, which shows they acknowledge that snooping isn't always justified. However, the key point here is the method. Even if the outcome was bad (the boyfriend cheating), the means of discovering it through deception might be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was already cheating, which is a major violation. The author might feel justified in their actions because it exposed the betrayal. But does that make it right? Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author had confronted the cheating through open dialogue instead of sneaking, maybe the situation could have been handled differently. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is important. He's upset about the privacy invasion, which he might see as worse than the cheating itself. The author's action could be seen as cutting off the relationship preemptively, but is that a valid reason to violate someone's privacy? \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the ends don't always justify the means. Even if the author found out about the cheating, the method of discovery through snooping might still be considered wrong. Trust is a two-way street, and if one partner can't be trusted, the relationship is already in trouble. However, the act of snooping can damage any remaining trust, even if the cheating had already occurred. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some people might view snooping as a last resort when trust is already broken, while others see it as a clear violation. The author's friends snooping for no reason are different, but their own case is framed as a necessary action to protect themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's cheating is undeniably wrong, the author's method of discovering it through snooping might still place them in the wrong because of the breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the outcome. Even if the action led to a negative truth, the way it was obtained could be ethically questionable.\n"
