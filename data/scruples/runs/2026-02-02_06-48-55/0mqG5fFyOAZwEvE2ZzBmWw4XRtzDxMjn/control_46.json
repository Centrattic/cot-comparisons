He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who snoopeds his partner's phone and found out about an affair. The guy left a note and left, then his partner got angry about the snooping, not the cheating itself.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The boyfriend felt his partner was distant and was told about a depressive hole. He couldn't shake the gut feeling, so he checked the phone. Found a girlfriend on the side. He left a note and left, then the partner yelled at him for invading privacy. The author argues that he wasn't just being nosy, but acted on a real issue and saved future heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the ethical aspects. Privacy is a big one. Even in a relationship, people have a right to privacy. Snooping in a phone without permission is generally considered a breach of trust. The fact that he did it secretly and then left a note might not mitigate the fact that he violated privacy.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of infidelity. The boyfriend was cheating, which is a major betrayal. The author's action led to the discovery of the cheating, which the author sees as justified. The dilemma here is whether the means (snooping) justify the end (exposing cheating).\n\nSome might argue that trust is foundational in a relationship, and if trust is broken by cheating, then the person being cheated on has cause for action. However, the method of discovering the infidelity could still be problematic. Even if there are suspicions, invading someone's privacy isn't usually the recommended approach. Open communication is typically advised, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nThe author mentions that he's against snooping unless there's a reason. He distinguishes himself from friends who are just nosy. So he's trying to justify his action based on a real issue. However, the partner's reaction was about the privacy violation rather than the cheating itself. The partner may have wanted to avoid confrontation or felt that the snooping was an overstep, regardless of the truth.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' autonomy and privacy is important. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping could be seen as violating that autonomy. However, in terms of practical outcomes, the snooping led to the truth coming out, which the author believes saved future pain.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at relationship advice, usually experts say that if you have suspicions, it's better to address them directly rather than snoop. Snooping can erode trust and is often seen as manipulative, regardless of the outcome. Even if the partner was cheating, the method of discovery might still be considered wrong because it's a violation of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did feel there was a valid reason and it led to ending a harmful situation. But the act itself is still considered wrong by many. So the answer might depend on the perspective: whether the action is judged based on the outcome or the action itself.\n\nIn summary, while the cheating was the real issue, the act of snooping is generally seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong for violating privacy, even with a justified reason. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
