A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive phase. The author felt something was wrong and decided to snoop while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating, left a note, and left. The boyfriend was upset, accused the author of not trusting him, and called them a piece of shit. The author defends their action by saying they had a reason\u2014realizing the cheating early saved future heartbreak. They contrast themselves with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they oppose.\n\nNow, the key points here. Trust is a big part of any relationship. Snooping, even with a justified reason, can be seen as violating that trust. The author's action, while stemming from a place of concern, breaks the boundary of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling betrayed, not just about the cheating itself. So, the author's justification is that they prevented more harm later. But does that make it right?\n\nThere's a balance between self-protection and respecting boundaries. If the partner was already showing signs of being dishonest or deceptive, maybe the author felt cornered. However, the act of snooping still violates privacy. Even if the outcome was positive (the author left before more heartbreak), the method is problematic. Relationships require mutual trust, and breaking that trust, even to uncover infidelity, can be ethically questionable.\n\nBut then, some might argue that when one partner is already unfaithful, the other isn't entirely in the wrong for seeking the truth. The question here is whether the means justify the ends. The author believes they did the right thing by leaving quickly and saving themselves future pain. However, the act of snooping could have been avoided if the author had confronted the boyfriend directly or sought counseling instead.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, snooping is generally frowned upon because it undermines trust. Even if the result was beneficial, the action itself is a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, is about feeling that his privacy was invaded. The author's note might have been a way to handle it without confrontation, but it doesn't negate the violation.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of violating privacy, even if the intention was to uncover the truth. However, the context of cheating complicates things. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the outcome. The act of snooping is the focus here. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the violation of privacy is a significant ethical issue, regardless of the outcome.\n"
