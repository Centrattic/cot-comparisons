A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive phase. They felt a \"gut feeling\" something was wrong, so they snooped while he was asleep. They found evidence of infidelity and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nThe author justifies it by saying they wanted to know the truth to avoid future heartbreak. They contrast their action with friends who snoop out of nosiness. The key points here are the reasons for snooping, the method (snooping without consent), and the consequences.\n\nLegally, in most places, a partner's phone privacy is protected. Sneaking into someone's digital devices without their consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if the intent is to find out the truth, it's a breach of trust. Relationships are built on mutual trust and communication. If the author had concerns, the appropriate step would have been to discuss them openly with the boyfriend instead of snooping. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction highlights the violation of trust. The author's action, while leading to a painful truth, was a breach of privacy. Even if the outcome was that the author decided to leave, the method of discovering the infidelity was ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had valid reasons given the partner's behavior. But the act of snooping itself is generally considered wrong because it undermines the foundation of trust. The author could have tried to talk things out first, perhaps leading to a more honest conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had suspicions, the decision to snoop was a violation of privacy and trust, making them at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
