A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snoop through their partner's phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, and after snooping, the person found out he was cheating. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is frowned upon, even in relationships. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and snooping can be seen as a breach of that trust. However, the person argues that they had a reason\u2014suspecting cheating\u2014and that it saved them future heartbreak. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a major betrayal, and the person might feel justified in wanting to know the truth. They didn't confront him immediately but left a note, which might show they were trying to handle it with some dignity. On the other hand, snooping without consent is a violation of privacy, and the boyfriend's reaction highlights that he felt his privacy was invaded, which could damage trust even more if the person had stayed.\n\nThe question of right or wrong can depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say that the ends justify the means here, while others would argue that respecting privacy is non-negotiable regardless of the situation. The person's justification is that they acted out of concern and to prevent further harm, but others might see it as an overstep regardless of the outcome.\n\nI need to decide if the action itself (snooping) makes them wrong, regardless of the result. Since the action was a privacy violation, the answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong), but the context of cheating adds complexity. However, in many ethical discussions, the act of snooping is considered wrong because it breaches trust and privacy, even if the motive is to uncover betrayal. The fact that the person left and didn't confront him immediately might also be seen as avoiding conflict, which could be another point against their action.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A. The person's action was a privacy violation, which is ethically wrong, even if it led to a truthful outcome.\n"
