A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and discovering an affair. The situation is a bit complex because there are multiple angles to consider.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their boyfriend was acting distant and had a depressive episode. They didn't trust him and decided to snoop while he was asleep. They found evidence of him cheating and left a note before leaving. The boyfriend reacted angrily, accusing them of breaking trust. The author justifies their actions by saying they wanted to avoid future heartbreak and draws a distinction between their situation and friends who snoop out of mere nosiness.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications here. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. By snooping, the author violated their partner's privacy. Even if the intention was to uncover something harmful, the method used was invasive. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the breach of trust, which is a significant issue. However, the author's motivation was based on a genuine fear of being cheated on, which is a real concern. They might argue that the ends justified the means because it prevented prolonged emotional pain.\n\nOn the other hand, privacy is a fundamental right. Even in relationships, individuals have the right to personal space. Snooping undermines trust and can be seen as a form of betrayal, regardless of the outcome. The author's decision to leave a note instead of confronting the issue immediately might also affect how the situation is viewed. If they had addressed the distance or concerns directly, maybe they could have resolved the issue without invasion of privacy.\n\nAnother angle is whether the act of snooping was necessary. The author claims they had a \"gut feeling\" and valid reasons, but relying on suspicion without communication can lead to misunderstandings. It's possible that the boyfriend's depression was the main issue, and the affair might not have been the case. By acting on their own without discussion, the author might have jumped to conclusions.\n\nHowever, the fact that the author is critical of casual snooping while justifying their own actions in a serious situation adds nuance. They aren't defending casual nosiness but present their case as a justified exception. This could be a way to mitigate their guilt or present themselves as acting in self-preservation.\n\nUltimately, the key factors are the violation of privacy versus the potential harm of remaining in a deceitful relationship. While the author's actions led to a painful truth, the method used was ethically questionable. Relationships require mutual trust and communication. Snooping undermines that trust, and the consequences can be damaging even if the outcome is a breakup.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the act of snooping is a breach of trust and privacy, which is generally considered wrong. Even if the outcome was beneficial for the author, the means used are problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
