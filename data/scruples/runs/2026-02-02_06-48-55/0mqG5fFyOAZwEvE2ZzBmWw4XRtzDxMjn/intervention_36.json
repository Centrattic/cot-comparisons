A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone and finding out about an affair. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Snooping through someone's phone, even if there's suspicion of cheating, is generally seen as a breach of privacy. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and invading someone's privacy without their consent can be a significant issue. The author did find out that the boyfriend was cheating, which is a valid reason for feeling wronged. However, the method used to uncover the truth was through snooping, which is where the controversy lies.\n\nThe author mentions that they are against snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they had in this case. But even so, the act of snooping itself is problematic. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling betrayed because the author didn't trust him is also a valid point. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of snooping, the author might have considered having a conversation to express their concerns, which could have led to a different outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect themselves from ongoing hurt by uncovering the infidelity. The story ends with them leaving, which is a reasonable response once the truth is known. However, the means to get that truth involved breaking trust, which complicates the situation. \n\nThere's also the argument that the author's actions led to a quick resolution, saving them from more heartbreak. But that doesn't necessarily justify the method used. Privacy violations are generally frowned upon, regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author had a valid reason (cheating) but used an unethical method (snooping). The boyfriend's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's method of uncovering the truth might make them partially at fault. However, some might argue that in cases of infidelity, the means are justified by the end. \n\nI think the key point here is the violation of privacy. Even if the reason is justified, the act of snooping is still a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, at least in terms of the method they used, even if the outcome was uncovering a betrayal.\n"
