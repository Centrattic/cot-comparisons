A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole, but the author found out he was cheating by checking his phone while he was asleep. They left a note before leaving and he called them out for invading privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships, and checking someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. Even if the author had suspicions, the act of secretly looking through the phone could be seen as a violation of boundaries. \n\nThe author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping unless something is really wrong. That's a key point. They felt there was a significant issue, which led them to snoop. However, even if there's a reason, the method might still be questionable. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author's action was a response to that suspicion. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was unfaithful, which is a betrayal. The author's action, while not ideal, might be viewed as a way to uncover the truth and protect themselves from future heartbreak. The saying \"ignorance is bliss\" is being challenged here, as the author chose to confront the issue directly instead of staying in a dishonest relationship.\n\nBut does that justify the snooping? In many relationships, open communication is preferred over secret surveillance. The author could have addressed their concerns directly, perhaps leading to a conversation where the cheating was revealed without the need for snooping. However, if the boyfriend was dishonest and hiding the infidelity, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to discover the truth.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the action. The author left a note, which is a respectful way to handle it compared to confronting him immediately. But the boyfriend's reaction highlights the emotional hurt from the invasion of privacy. So even though the cheating is a bad act, the author's method of uncovering it might be seen as wrong because it broke trust and violated privacy.\n\nI need to weigh the moral wrongness of both actions: cheating versus snooping. Cheating is typically considered a more serious betrayal. However, the act of snooping also undermines the relationship's foundation of trust. The author's justification is that they saved themselves future pain, but the question is whether the means justify the ends here.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. If the boyfriend had been honest, the author might have handled it differently. Snooping without consent is a gray area. Some might argue it's understandable given the circumstances, while others would say it's still wrong regardless of the reason.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's infidelity is a major issue, the author's action of snooping is still a breach of privacy. So depending on the perspective, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong. But maybe the context of the cheating might soften the judgment. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the boyfriend. So even if the cheating is worse, the act of snooping isn't justified.\n"
