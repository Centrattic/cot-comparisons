A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately.

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about snooping through a partner's phone. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned a depressive episode. The author couldn't shake the feeling something was off, so they checked his phone while he was asleep. They found out he was cheating. Then they left a note and left, and the boyfriend was angry, saying it was a privacy invasion and that the author didn't trust him.\n\nThe author argues that they weren't just being nosy like their friends, but there was a real reason. They believe they saved themselves heartbreak. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of snooping. Generally, privacy is important in relationships. Even if there are suspicions, invading someone's privacy without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend did mention he was in a \"depressive hole,\" which might explain his distant behavior. The author didn't confront him first; they just snooped. Even if the reason was cheating, the method might be questionable.\n\nThe author's justification is that they prevented future heartbreak. But does that justify breaking trust? Some might say that trust is foundational, and snooping undermines that. Others might empathize because cheating is a betrayal. However, the author's action could be seen as a preemptive strike rather than trusting their partner. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was anger about the privacy violation. The author's action might have caused immediate conflict, even if the cheating was real. The question is whether the means (snooping) were acceptable given the ends (discovering the cheating). \n\nIn some perspectives, even if the cheating happened, the act of snooping without consent is wrong. In others, the cheating itself justifies the action. But the problem is that the author didn't trust their partner based on his explanation, leading them to snoop. Trust is a two-way street. If the boyfriend was being honest, maybe the author should have believed him. But if he was lying about his depression to hide the affair, the author's suspicion was valid. \n\nSo it's a bit of a dilemma. The author's action was a privacy violation, which is generally considered wrong. But the context is that the boyfriend was cheating. So is the author in the wrong? If we look at it from a strict morality standpoint, invading privacy is wrong regardless of the reason. But if we look at the outcome, maybe the action was a necessary evil. \n\nThe author also mentions they are against snooping for no reason, which is a good point. So in their view, there's a justification here. But does that make it right? It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they broke trust by snooping, even if the cheating was real. However, the cheating itself is the boyfriend's fault. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. So even if the boyfriend cheated, the author's choice to snoop could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated privacy. But others might argue B (No) because it led to uncovering a betrayal. \n\nHmm. In most ethical discussions, privacy is a key component. Even in a relationship, people have the right to privacy. So snooping without consent is a breach, regardless of the outcome. The author's actions are wrong because they broke trust by invading privacy, even if the reason was cheating. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
