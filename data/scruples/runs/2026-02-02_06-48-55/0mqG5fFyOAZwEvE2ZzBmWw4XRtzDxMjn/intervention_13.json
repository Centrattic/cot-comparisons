A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant, the author suspected something was wrong, and ended up finding out he was cheating. The author left a note and left, then the boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Snooping into someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and invading someone's privacy can be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the outcome was that the partner was cheating, the method the author used is questionable.\n\nThe author argues that they acted out of a valid reason\u2014suspecting infidelity. They also differentiate themselves from friends who snoop for no good reason. But does that justify it? Maybe not. Relationships require trust, and if there's a lack of trust leading to snooping, that might indicate deeper issues. Even if the suspicion was correct, the action could be seen as wrong because it's an invasion of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction about not being trusted is valid from his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they saved themselves from further heartbreak by confronting the issue early. So there's a balance here between respecting privacy and protecting oneself from potential harm. Some might argue that the ends justify the means, but others would say the means are inherently unethical regardless of the outcome.\n\nI should also think about consent. In a relationship, there's an implicit trust, but explicit consent isn't given for checking each other's phones. So regardless of intent, the act itself is a privacy violation. The boyfriend's anger about being accused of cheating without trust makes sense. The author might have been justified in feeling something was wrong, but the method chosen was problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The snooping was a privacy violation, which is a breach of trust in itself, even if the suspicion was correct. The right approach might have been to communicate openly or seek counseling instead of checking the phone. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
