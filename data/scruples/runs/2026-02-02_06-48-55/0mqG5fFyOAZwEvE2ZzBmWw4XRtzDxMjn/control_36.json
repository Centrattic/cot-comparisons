A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for snooping through their partner's phone. The situation is that the boyfriend was acting distant and mentioned being in a depressive hole. The author, feeling something was wrong, snooped and found out he had a girl on the side. They left a note and left, then the boyfriend yelled at them for invading privacy and not trusting him.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, snooping through someone's phone without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. That's a key point. Even if there's suspicion, invading privacy without permission can be seen as wrong. But then, the author mentions that they had a reason\u2014they felt something was really wrong and it turned out to be the case. They also contrast their action with friends who snoop for no good reason. So there's a justification based on their concern and the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, trust is a big part of relationships. The boyfriend felt the snoop was a betrayal, which adds to the complexity. The author's argument is that they saved themselves future heartbreak by acting on their suspicion. But relationships often require trust, and acting without trust can lead to issues, even if the outcome is that the other person cheated.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is between privacy and self-protection. Legally, snooping isn't illegal, but ethically, it's debatable. Some might say that the ends justify the means because the author discovered infidelity. Others would argue that the means were unethical, regardless of the outcome. The author's own stance is that it's okay when there's a real reason, but not when it's just nosy.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's no clear answer. Some people might support the author for taking action based on intuition, while others might criticize the invasion of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction is also a factor\u2014feeling that the lack of trust led to the cheating. But the author's perspective is that they were justified in their actions.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. If the author had a legitimate reason (their gut feeling) and the action led to uncovering a betrayal, some might see it as necessary. However, the act of snooping without consent is still a breach of privacy. Different people have different views on this. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering both perspectives, the answer might lean towards A (yes, wrong) because of the privacy violation, even if the outcome was beneficial. Alternatively, if the context is that the cheating was already happening, maybe B (no) because they prevented further harm.\n\nBut in ethical terms, the act itself is a violation of trust and privacy. Even if the cheating was happening, the method of discovery could be seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A. But others might argue B. It's tricky. The author's justification is strong because they acted on genuine concern, but the act is still ethically questionable. I think the answer is A, they're in the wrong.\n"
