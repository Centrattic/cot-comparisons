A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves snooping through a partner's phone, finding out about an affair, and then leaving a note before leaving. The author justifies it by saying they wanted to avoid more heartbreak and distinguishes themselves from people who snoop out of nosiness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Privacy is a big deal. Even if the partner was cheating, the act of snooping without consent is a violation of trust and privacy. Relationships are built on mutual trust, so the act of checking the phone without permission might have been a breach regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author felt the partner was distant and had a gut feeling something was wrong. But instead of addressing the issue openly, they chose to snoop. The partner later accuses them of not trusting him. This could be seen as the author contributing to the breakdown of trust, even though they found out about the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they saved themselves from future pain. If the partner was indeed cheating, maybe the relationship was already doomed. However, the method of finding out might have been the catalyst for the conflict. The partner's reaction (yelling and calling them a piece of shit) shows that the snoop was a major violation to him.\n\nThere's also the aspect of self-respect and how one handles suspicion. Trust issues are common, but acting on suspicion without communication can be problematic. The author might have acted out of fear and a desire for clarity, but the means were invasive.\n\nLegally, there might not be a wrong doing, but ethically, it's a gray area. The intention was to protect themselves, but the method involved a privacy violation. The result was a split, but the manner in which it happened might have caused more harm in the relationship's end.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the outcome was the truth coming out, the act of snooping was a breach of trust and privacy. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the situation, were ethically wrong. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
