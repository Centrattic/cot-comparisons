A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for snooping through their boyfriend's phone. The boyfriend was acting distant, and when asked, he said he was in a depressive hole. But the author felt something was wrong and decided to snoop while he was asleep. They found evidence of him having a girl on the side. Then they left a note and left. The boyfriend called them out for invading privacy and said it proves they didn't trust him. The author defends their actions by saying they did it because they felt something was really wrong, not just out of nosiness. They argue that they saved themselves future heartbreak by finding out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks A, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's think about the ethics of snooping. Generally, invading someone's privacy is considered wrong unless there's a very good reason. In relationships, trust is key. If you don't trust your partner, that can be a red flag. However, the author claims they had a strong gut feeling something was wrong, not just random suspicion. They also contrast their actions with friends who snoop out of nosiness, which they disapprove of. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to uncover infidelity, which is a serious issue. They might argue that the ends justified the means. On the other hand, the act of snooping without consent breaches trust and privacy. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling them a piece of shit\u2014suggests he felt deeply violated. Even if the author is right about the cheating, the method of finding out might have caused additional harm to the relationship.\n\nAlso, communication is important in relationships. Instead of snooping, the author could have tried more open communication to address the distance. However, the boyfriend didn't seem to open up when asked directly, so maybe that wasn't an option. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, snooping into someone's phone without permission could be an issue, but morally, it's more about the ethics. The author might believe they were protecting themselves, but the act itself is invasive. Even if the outcome was good (discover the cheating), the method involved breaking trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they violated their partner's privacy, which is a significant breach, even if their intent was to find out the truth. Trust in a relationship should be built, not bypassed through snooping. Even if the cheating was real, the way the author discovered it could have compounded the issues.\n"
