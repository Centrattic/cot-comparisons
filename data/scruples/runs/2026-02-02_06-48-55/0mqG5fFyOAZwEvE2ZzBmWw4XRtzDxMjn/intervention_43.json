A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author snoop on their boyfriend's phone and found out he was cheating, then left a note and left. The boyfriend was upset about the privacy invasion. The author defends their actions by saying they had a good reason and saved themselves from heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Snooping through someone's phone is a breach of privacy, even if the intention is to find out about cheating. Privacy is a fundamental right in relationships, and trust is built on respecting boundaries. Even if the author had a valid reason, the act itself is still a violation. \n\nThen there's the argument about the outcome. The author discovered the infidelity and ended the relationship, which might have saved them pain later. However, the method used (snooping) is problematic. Trust issues in a relationship should ideally be addressed through communication, not surveillance. The boyfriend's reaction about feeling untrusted is valid because snooping undermines that trust. \n\nThe author mentions that they aren't pro-snooping unless there's a strong reason, which they felt existed here. But the line between justified and unjustified snooping is blurry. Even with a reason, it's still an invasion of privacy. Relationships require mutual trust, and if that's not there, maybe the relationship isn't healthy regardless of the cheating. \n\nAlso, the legal perspective: in many places, snooping through someone's phone is illegal, which adds another layer of wrongness. But the user is asking about moral/ethical wrongness, not just legality. \n\nSo, weighing the harm caused by the cheating against the harm caused by the snooping. The cheating is a betrayal, but the snooping was a proactive but invasive action. The author's justification that they saved themselves heartbreak is valid, but the means used might still be considered wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the act of snooping violates the boyfriend's privacy and trust. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
