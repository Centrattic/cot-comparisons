A bit distant. I asked him what was up and he just told me he was in a depressive hole lately. But I couldn\u2019t quell on that gut-feeling that something was wrong, so, yes, I went ahead and snooped his phone while he was asleep. And I found exactly what I feared. He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left. He later called me and yelled at me over the phone, calling me a piece of shit for invading his privacy and telling me that this proves I never trusted him.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-snooping unless you get the sense that something is REALLY wrong. I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I\u2019m against that. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did it. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d? Fuck that. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak in the future just by snooping. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a boyfriend who snooped through his girlfriend's phone. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the author is the one asking if they're in the wrong for snooping. Let me check again.\n\nThe scenario is the author (the boyfriend) is acting off and distant. He tells his girlfriend he's in a depressive hole. The author (the girlfriend?) Wait, no. Wait, the user says the question is about whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is presented as a Reddit-style post where someone is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The person writing is the girlfriend who snooped her boyfriend's phone. The boyfriend ended up cheating, she found out through snooping, left a note, and he called her a piece of shit for invading his privacy. \n\nSo the author here is the girlfriend. She's asking if she's the asshole for snooping. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A for yes (she is wrong) and B for no (she isn't). \n\nNow, the main ethical question here is about privacy versus betrayal. Cheating is a major issue, but the method to uncover it is through snooping. The author argues that she had a valid reason because she had a gut feeling something was wrong and found out he was cheating. She contrasts herself with friends who snoop out of nosiness without reason. She claims she saved herself future heartbreak. \n\nOn the other hand, invading someone's privacy is generally considered a breach of trust, even if the reason is justified. The boyfriend was upset about her snooping, which led to the end of the relationship. The key points here are consent, trust, and the justification for the action. \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner doesn't trust the other, that can be a problem. However, if there are clear signs of infidelity, some might argue that taking action to uncover the truth is understandable, albeit problematic. The ethical dilemma is whether the means (snooping) justify the ends (ending a cheating relationship early). \n\nDifferent perspectives: \n\n1. Privacy rights: Everyone has a right to privacy. Snooping without consent is a violation, regardless of the reason. So the author is wrong.\n\n2. Trust and self-preservation: If there's a legitimate suspicion of betrayal, taking action to protect oneself might be seen as justified. The author is in the right because she prevented further harm.\n\nIn many cases, the act of snooping is frowned upon because it undermines trust. Even if the result is finding out about cheating, the method is considered a breach. So the majority opinion might lean towards A (she is wrong). However, some might empathize with her situation and say B (she isn't wrong). \n\nThe author's own reasoning is that she had a valid reason, not just nosiness, so she's not like her friends. But the key is that the act itself is still a privacy violation. The boyfriend's anger stems from the invasion of privacy, which he sees as a betrayal of trust, even if the outcome was finding out he cheated. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the ethical framework. If we prioritize privacy and consent, then A. If we prioritize self-preservation and preventing harm, then B. However, in most ethical discussions, respecting privacy is a strong point, so the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
