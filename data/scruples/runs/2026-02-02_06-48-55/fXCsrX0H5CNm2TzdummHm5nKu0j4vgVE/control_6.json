      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money is important when deciding to have a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends are saying that money shouldn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments on both sides. The author's stance is that financial stability is necessary to provide for a child, covering living costs and avoiding long-term issues. Their friends and family argue that money isn't the main factor. The author is being called the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is wrong.\n\nI should consider the common advice on this topic. Many sources, including health organizations and financial planners, emphasize the importance of financial preparedness when considering parenthood. They point out the high costs of raising a child, from healthcare to education, and how financial stress can impact family well-being. On the other hand, some might argue that love and commitment are more important than money, but this often overlooks the practical realities.\n\nNext, the social context: the author is in their early 20s (M23) and their partner is 22. They might be in a phase where financial stability is still a goal. Their friends and family might not be considering the current economic climate, like rising costs and job market uncertainties, which make financial planning even more critical.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. The author's reasoning is practical and aligns with expert advice. Their friends' dismissal of money's role could be seen as idealistic but not necessarily right. The author isn't dismissing other factors like love or support, just highlighting the importance of financial aspects.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable argument based on the practical costs of raising a child, which many experts agree is a significant factor. Their friends and family might be oversimplifying the issue by ignoring financial realities.\n"
