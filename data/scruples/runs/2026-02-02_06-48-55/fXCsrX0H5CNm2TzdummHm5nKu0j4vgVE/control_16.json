      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their stance on money and having a child. The author is arguing against their parents and friends who say money isn't important when deciding to have a kid. The author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable. They mention the high costs of living and potential issues if you can't support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general societal views. While love and emotional readiness are often emphasized in parenting, financial stability is also commonly discussed as a factor. People might argue that being financially stable can reduce stress and provide better opportunities for the child. On the other hand, some might say that love and care are more important than money, and that financial stability isn't a guarantee against problems.\n\nThe author's position is that money does matter, and they're planning accordingly. Their friends and family think money isn't a factor. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking this. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person is being reasonable. The author is planning for the future and considering financial aspects, which is a common and practical approach. The friends and family are dismissing the importance of money, which the author finds unreasonable. Since the author's argument is based on practical concerns and their girlfriend agrees, it seems like their position is valid. The friends' dismissal of financial planning might be seen as not taking the author's concerns seriously. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. They're trying to plan responsibly. The friends and parents might be idealistic, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The key here is that both sides have valid points, but the author is taking a responsible approach. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
