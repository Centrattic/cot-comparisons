I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money does matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends say money has no merit in deciding to have a kid. The author argues that they want to be financially stable to provide for the child, and that not being able to support a child financially can cause long-term issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Many people do believe that financial stability is crucial for raising a child, as it affects the child's well-being, access to resources, education, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author is not saying money is the only factor; they're just emphasizing that it's a necessary part of planning.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding that view. The author's stance seems reasonable. It's practical to plan financially before having a child. The friends and parents who say money doesn't matter might be minimizing the importance of financial aspects. The author is not dismissing other factors but is highlighting that financial stability is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasoning is logical and responsible. They agree with their girlfriend, which shows mutual understanding. The key here is that the author isn't denying other factors but is correctly pointing out that money does play a significant role in a child's upbringing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
