We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money isn't important when having a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author argues that financial stability is crucial for providing for a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the role of finances in deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable. They mention the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if they can't support the child. This seems reasonable because financial instability can lead to stress, impact the child's quality of life, and affect overall family well-being.\n\nThe people around them claim money has no merit in this decision. But the author is pointing out the practical realities\u2014childcare, education, healthcare, and other expenses. Studies and common advice often emphasize financial preparedness as a key factor in raising a child. So, the author's stance seems logical and responsible.\n\nThe friends and parents might be prioritizing emotional readiness or other factors, but dismissing financial aspects entirely isn't sound advice. The author isn't being selfish; they're planning for the child's future. There's no indication they're being unreasonable or selfish. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
