I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. The girlfriend agrees. They discussed the high costs and potential issues if you can't support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The main point is whether financial stability is relevant for raising a child. Common advice often emphasizes the importance of being able to afford a child's needs. So, the author is taking a practical stance here. Their friends and family are saying money doesn't matter, which might be idealistic or ignore real-world financial challenges.\n\nThe author's argument is about providing for the child's well-being, which is a responsible consideration. It's reasonable to plan financially before having a child. There's no moral obligation to have a child when you can't support them. The friends' stance might not consider the practical aspects, like healthcare, education, and daily living expenses.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the importance of love or other factors, just emphasizing financial stability. This is a valid perspective. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a pragmatic choice, which is understandable and responsible.\n"
