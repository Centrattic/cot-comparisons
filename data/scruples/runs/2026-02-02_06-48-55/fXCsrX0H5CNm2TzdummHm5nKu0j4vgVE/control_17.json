      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter when having a kid. The author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important to provide for a child, and they discussed the high costs involved. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking that money does matter.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what AITA usually considers. These stories often hinge on social norms, personal responsibility, and empathy. The author's stance is that planning financially is responsible. Their friends and parents dismiss money's role, which the author disagrees with.\n\nFinancial stability is a common recommendation for having kids. Many experts suggest that it's important to have a stable income and savings to handle childcare, education, healthcare, etc. So the author's view aligns with practical advice. Their friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and care are more important than money, which is true, but the author is pointing out the practical necessity of financial resources.\n\nThe author isn't saying that love isn't important, just that money is a practical factor. There's no indication of them being dismissive of other factors. They're considering the child's well-being in terms of support. The friends and parents might be in a different situation, maybe they had kids without financial stability and it worked out, but that doesn't mean the author's approach is wrong.\n\nSo, the author is trying to plan responsibly. Since the question is about being the asshole, if the author is just making a reasonable argument for financial planning, they're not in the wrong. Their friends and parents have their own perspective, but the author isn't being unreasonable here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
