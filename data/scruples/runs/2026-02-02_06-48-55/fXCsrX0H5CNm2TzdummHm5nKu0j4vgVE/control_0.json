I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child. The author mentions planning to have a kid once financially stable, and their girlfriend agrees. They discussed the costs and how not being able to support a child can cause issues.\n\nSo, the main point is whether considering financial stability is valid. I need to determine if the author's stance is wrong. Well, financial stability is a common concern when planning a family. Many people argue that having enough money is crucial for a child's well-being, covering things like healthcare, education, and basic needs. The author's friends and parents might be emphasizing other aspects like love and stability, but that doesn't negate the importance of money. \n\nThe author is not wrong for thinking money matters. They're making a practical decision based on real-world costs. Their friends' perspective might be idealistic, but the author is being realistic. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're just prioritizing financial preparedness, which is a reasonable approach.\n"
