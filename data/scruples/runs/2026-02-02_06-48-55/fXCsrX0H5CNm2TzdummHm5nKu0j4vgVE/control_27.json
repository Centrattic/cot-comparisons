      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter, but the AITA and their girlfriend think they should be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Generally, people do talk about the importance of financial stability when it comes to having kids. Kids are expensive\u2014basic needs like food, healthcare, education, and housing all cost money. If someone isn't in a good financial position, it can lead to stress and affect the child's well-being. So the AITA's reasoning seems logical here.\n\nThe friends and parents saying money doesn't matter might be emphasizing that love and emotional support are more important. While that's true in a sense, financial stability can contribute to providing a stable environment. It's a balance, but the AITA isn't outright wrong for valuing financial readiness.\n\nThe question is whether the AITA is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because it's reasonable to consider financial factors in such a major life decision. People often plan for financial aspects before having children to ensure they can provide adequately. The AITA isn't dismissing other factors but is making a practical consideration, which is valid.\n"
