I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money plays a role in deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend think having a kid when they can't support the child financially is a bad idea, but their parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for disagreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's stance is that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. Their friends and family argue that money isn't a factor. From a general knowledge perspective, I know that children benefit from being raised in a stable environment, which includes financial security. Poverty can lead to various challenges for children, such as limited access to education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities. So, the author's concern is valid.\n\nBut wait, the friends and family might be emphasizing that love and emotional support are more crucial than financial means. While that's true, financial stability can contribute to reducing stress in the household, which is important for a child's mental health. It's a balance. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is now unsure. I need to assess if the author's argument is reasonable. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. Their girlfriend agrees. The friends and parents might be dismissing a valid point. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
