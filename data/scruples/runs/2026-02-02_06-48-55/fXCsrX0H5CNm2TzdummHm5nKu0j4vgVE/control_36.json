I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the role of money in deciding to have a child. The author is arguing that money does matter, while others say it doesn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider common viewpoints. Many people do argue that financial stability is important for raising a child because of the costs involved\u2014basic needs like food, healthcare, education, etc. There's also the idea that financial stress can affect parenting and the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that love, support, and a stable environment are more crucial than money. But the author is making a valid point that financial instability can lead to hardships, which can impact the child's life. They also mentioned discussing this with their girlfriend, which shows they're considering the future.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for disagreeing with the \"money doesn't matter\" perspective. Since there's a lot of evidence and expert opinion supporting the importance of financial stability in raising children, the author isn't in the wrong. They're just having a realistic perspective. Their friends and parents might be idealistic, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. So the answer should be B.\n"
