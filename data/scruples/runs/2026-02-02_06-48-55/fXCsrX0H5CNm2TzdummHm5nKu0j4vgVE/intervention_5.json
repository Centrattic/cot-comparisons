I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is saying that their parents and friends argue that money shouldn't matter when deciding to have a child. The author disagrees, emphasizing the importance of financial stability to support a child. They mention discussing the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if a child isn't financially supported. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the \"money doesn't matter\" statement is nonsense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. On one hand, some people believe that love and care are more important than financial aspects. On the other hand, financial stability can significantly impact a child's well-being, access to education, healthcare, and overall quality of life. The author is pointing out practical concerns like costs, which are real and valid. \n\nThe friends and parents in the scenario might be making an idealistic point, but the author is responding with practicality. Financial planning is often recommended as essential before having children. So, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. They're not dismissing other factors but highlighting the importance of financial readiness. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the reasoning, the author's argument is grounded in practical concerns. Therefore, the correct answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
