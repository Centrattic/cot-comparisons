      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they believe that money does matter in deciding to have a child. The scenario is that the author (AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\") is being told by parents and friends that money shouldn't be a factor in having kids. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child and mentions the high costs of raising a child. The girlfriend agrees with them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is reasonable. The core issue here is the role of financial considerations in the decision to have children. On one hand, some people might say that love and care are more important than money, and that financial stability isn't a prerequisite. On the other hand, the author is concerned about the child's well-being, which is a valid point. Raising a child is expensive, and being financially unstable could lead to stress and potential hardships for the child. \n\nThe author's friends and parents are dismissing the financial aspect, which the author finds frustrating. The question is whether the author is the asshole for thinking money does matter. \n\nIn many cases, people make the decision to have children based on various factors, including financial readiness. There's a common argument that you can raise a child without a lot of money but that planning financially is crucial. The author's position seems to be that they want to be in a stable financial position to support the child, which is a responsible approach. The friends and parents might be idealistic, but the author is prioritizing the child's future, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). They are making a practical decision based on wanting to provide for their child, and it's reasonable to consider financial stability when planning parenthood. The friends and parents might be right in that money isn't everything, but the author isn't wrong to want to be prepared financially.\n"
