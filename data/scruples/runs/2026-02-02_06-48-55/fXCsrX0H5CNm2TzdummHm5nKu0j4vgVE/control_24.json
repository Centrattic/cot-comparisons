I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

The friends and parents said money has no merit, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is arguing against the idea that money isn't important for raising a child. They and their girlfriend want to be stable before having a kid. The friends say money doesn't matter, but the author thinks that's not true because of the costs involved.\n\nIs the author right? Well, from a practical standpoint, financial stability definitely plays a role in providing for a child's needs. Basic things like food, shelter, healthcare, education all cost money. If a parent can't support a child financially, it can lead to stress, neglect, or long-term issues. So the author's reasoning makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the question here is about the author's stance being wrong. Since the author is not dismissing the emotional aspects but is focusing on financial responsibility, they're not in the wrong. The friends' statement that money has nothing to do with it is an oversimplification. Therefore, the author is justified in their opinion. The answer should be B (No).\n"
