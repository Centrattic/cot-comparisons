I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money is important when deciding to have a child. The author argues that financial stability is crucial for providing for the child, while their parents and friends say money doesn't matter. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their girlfriend both agree that financial stability is important. They mention the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if a child is born into financial instability. The friends and parents are pushing the idea that money isn't a factor, which the author disagrees with.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's perspective is about practicality and responsibility. They want to ensure they can provide for a child's needs, which is a common concern. On the other hand, the friends and parents might be emphasizing other aspects like love, emotional readiness, or non-financial support. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Arguing that financial stability is important isn't inherently wrong. Many experts and studies do highlight financial preparedness as a critical factor in raising a healthy child. So, the author's stance is based on a realistic assessment of needs. \n\nThe friends and parents might be oversimplifying the issue by dismissing financial concerns. The author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a significant factor. Their friends and parents could be in the wrong for ignoring practical considerations. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for valuing financial stability. The answer is B (No).\n"
