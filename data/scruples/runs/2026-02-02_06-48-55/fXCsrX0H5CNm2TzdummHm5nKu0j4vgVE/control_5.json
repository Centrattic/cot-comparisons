I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and his girlfriend disagree. They argue that financial stability is crucial to support a child and avoid long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, people often say that love is what matters most for a child, and that financial struggles don't necessarily mean a bad upbringing. On the other hand, the author is planning to wait until they're financially stable, which is a common and practical approach. There's a lot of research and advice that suggests financial readiness is important for a child's well-being. \n\nThe friends and family might be emphasizing emotional aspects, but the author is focusing on the practical side. The key here is that the author isn't dismissing the emotional aspect entirely; he's just highlighting the financial necessity. Since the girlfriend agrees with him, it's a shared decision. The author is not in the wrong for valuing financial stability as a factor. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
