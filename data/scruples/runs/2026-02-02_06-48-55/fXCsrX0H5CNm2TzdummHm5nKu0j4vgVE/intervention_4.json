I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for thinking that money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and his girlfriend disagree, arguing that financial stability is crucial to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common viewpoints. Many people argue that while money isn't everything, financial stability can significantly impact a child's upbringing. It affects access to education, healthcare, and basic needs. On the other hand, others might say that love, support, and emotional readiness are more important than money.\n\nThe AITA is challenging the notion that money isn't a factor. He's not dismissing the importance of emotional aspects entirely, but he's emphasizing financial planning. His girlfriend agrees with him, so it's a mutual decision. They discussed the costs and potential issues, which shows they're being responsible.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but maybe that's influenced by their own beliefs. I should evaluate based on the arguments presented. The author's reasoning is logical and practical. It's not about money being the sole factor, but about avoiding hardship. Society often overlooks the practical challenges of parenting, but the author is being realistic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's making a responsible decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
