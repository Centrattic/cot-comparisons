      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author argues that financial stability is important, and their parents and friends say money has no merit. The author is being told they're wrong for thinking money matters.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's stance is valid. Well, common sense would say that financial stability is a significant factor in raising a child. Kids require a lot of expenses\u2014basic needs like food, clothing, housing, healthcare, education, etc. If a family isn't financially stable, it can lead to stress and affect the child's well-being. Studies and experts often mention financial preparedness as a key aspect of parenting.\n\nThe author's friends and parents are dismissing the financial aspect, which might be an oversimplification. They might be emphasizing love and commitment over financial matters, which is valid but not the whole picture. The author is concerned about providing for the child, which is a responsible consideration. So in this case, the author is not wrong for thinking that money does matter.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend agrees with the author, which shows mutual understanding. The question is whether the author is the asshole for disagreeing with their family and friends. Since financial readiness is a legitimate factor, the answer would be B (No). The author is not in the wrong here.\n"
