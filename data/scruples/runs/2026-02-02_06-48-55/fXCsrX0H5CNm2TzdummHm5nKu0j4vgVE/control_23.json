      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money has nothing to do with having a child. Let me break this down. The author (AITA) is saying that financial stability is important when planning to have a kid, and their girlfriend agrees. The parents and friends argue that money shouldn't be a factor in the decision. The author is then told that their statement is \"bullshit,\" and they're wondering if they are the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of both sides. On one hand, some people might believe that love and care are the most important aspects of raising a child, not money. They might argue that financial stability can be achieved over time, and that the emotional support is what truly matters. But on the other hand, the author is pointing out that the cost of living, especially with a child, can be significant. There's the cost of diapers, healthcare, education, housing, and so on. Without financial stability, these expenses could lead to stress and long-term issues for the family and the child.\n\nI should also think about the common advice given on parenting forums and real-life experiences. Many sources do emphasize the importance of being financially prepared before having children. The cost of raising a child is often cited as a major factor, and lacking financial stability can affect the quality of life and resources available to the child. So the author's point is not without merit. \n\nThe parents and friends might be idealistic, thinking that people can adjust and find ways to manage, but the author is being practical. The key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Since having a child when you can't support them financially can indeed lead to problems, the author's stance seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
