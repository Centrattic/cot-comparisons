I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is arguing with friends and family about whether money plays a role in deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend believe that financial stability is important, while their parents and friends say money has nothing to do with it. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that money does matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important for a child than financial status. There's the idea that you can still provide a good life without a lot of money, and that financial instability can be managed. On the other hand, the author's perspective is that financial stability helps ensure the child's needs are met, reduces stress, and prevents long-term issues. \n\nI should consider the common arguments around this topic. Financial stability can impact a child's access to healthcare, education, and basic necessities. However, there are also counterarguments that some people with less money are still able to raise healthy, happy children. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability in their decision to have a child.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is objectively wrong. The author isn't saying money is everything, but that it's a significant factor. Their friends and family seem to dismiss the role of money entirely, which the author disagrees with. The author's argument is that financial stability can prevent long-term issues, which is a valid point. So, the author is not in the wrong for valuing financial stability as part of the decision to have a child. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
