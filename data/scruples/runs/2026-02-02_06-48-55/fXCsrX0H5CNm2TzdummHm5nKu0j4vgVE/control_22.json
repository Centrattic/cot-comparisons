We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend are planning to have a kid once they're financially stable. Their parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter when deciding to have a child. The author disagrees, thinking that financial stability is important to avoid long-term issues for the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The friends and family say money isn't a factor, maybe emphasizing love and emotional readiness. The author thinks financial stability is crucial for providing for the child's needs, like education, healthcare, and a stable home environment. \n\nI should check if there's a general consensus on this. Most experts do advise considering financial readiness as part of being prepared for parenthood. Children have significant expenses, and financial stress can impact family dynamics. So the author's stance is reasonable. Their friends might be downplaying the importance of finances, which could be naive or dismissive of real-world challenges.\n\nAlso, the author's intention is to plan and ensure they can support the child, which is a responsible approach. The fact that the girlfriend agrees suggests mutual understanding. The key here is whether financial stability is a valid concern. Since it's a common recommendation from parenting resources and financial advisors, the author's position isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
