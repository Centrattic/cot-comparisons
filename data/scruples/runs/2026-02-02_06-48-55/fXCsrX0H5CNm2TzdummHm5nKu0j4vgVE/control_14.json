      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money isn't important when deciding to have a kid. The author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial to properly support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The friends and family are dismissing money's role in having a child, while the author argues that financial stability is key. The author is being called out for thinking the statement is \"bullshit,\" and they want to know if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nI should consider the arguments on both sides. On one hand, some people might say that while money helps, it's not the only factor. They might argue that love, emotional support, and other resources are more important. However, there's a lot of evidence that financial instability can lead to stress, which affects parenting and child development. Also, the cost of raising a child is substantial\u2014housing, food, education, healthcare. Without financial stability, those basics can be compromised.\n\nThe author's stance seems reasonable. Planning financially can prevent long-term issues. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding that view. The friends and parents might be idealistic, but the author is being pragmatic. The key here is whether the author's argument is valid. Since financial stability is a legitimate concern for a child's well-being, the author isn't the asshole. Their perspective is valid and responsible. So the answer should be B.\n"
