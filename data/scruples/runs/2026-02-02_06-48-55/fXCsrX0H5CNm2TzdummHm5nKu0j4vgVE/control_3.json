I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author's belief that money is important when deciding to have a child, while their parents and friends argue that money doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the argument. The author is saying that financial stability is a key factor, and that having a child without it can lead to long-term issues. Their girlfriend agrees. The parents and friends think money shouldn't be a factor. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking the opposite.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability in having a child. Let me think about the common perspectives here. On one hand, many people believe that children should be a result of love and commitment, not financial status. On the other hand, financial stability can affect a child's well-being, access to resources, education, healthcare, etc. It's a debate between emotional vs. practical considerations.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The parents and friends are saying money isn't important, but the author is concerned about providing. The author's stance is that planning financially is necessary to support the child. There's no inherent wrongness in wanting to be financially prepared. It's a responsible approach. However, some might argue that it's not the only factor, but the author isn't saying money is the only thing\u2014just that it's an important part.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author isn't being malicious. They're expressing a valid concern. The parents and friends might be idealists, but the author's position is pragmatic. Since the author's intention is to ensure the child's well-being, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
