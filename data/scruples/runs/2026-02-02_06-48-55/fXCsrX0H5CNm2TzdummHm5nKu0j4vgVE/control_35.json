I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for believing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends are saying money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The friends and family's stance is that money isn't important for raising a child. But the author argues that not being financially stable can lead to long-term issues for the child. \n\nFinancial stability can affect a child's upbringing in many ways, like access to healthcare, education, and a safe environment. Studies often show that socioeconomic status impacts a child's development. So, the author's concern is valid. \n\nBut is the author wrong for holding that view? Well, the friends and family might be emphasizing emotional preparedness over financial aspects. However, it's reasonable to consider financial factors as part of being prepared for parenthood. The author isn't dismissing emotional or other factors; they're just highlighting the importance of financial planning. \n\nSince the author's argument is based on practical considerations and potential negative outcomes of financial instability, their stance seems justified. Therefore, they aren't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
