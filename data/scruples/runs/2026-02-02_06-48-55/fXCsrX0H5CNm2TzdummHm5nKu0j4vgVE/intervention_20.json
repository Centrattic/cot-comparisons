      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend are saying that financial stability is important, while their parents and friends argue that money isn't a factor that should influence the decision. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking the financial aspect is important.\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments on both sides. The author's stance is that having a child when you can't support them financially can lead to long-term issues. That makes sense because raising a child is expensive. Medical costs, education, food, housing, and other needs all require money. If a parent can't provide, it might affect the child's well-being. There's research suggesting that financial stress can impact parenting quality and the child's development, so the author's concern isn't unfounded.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents and friends might be emphasizing that love and care are more important than money. They could be saying that people can have kids even with limited resources because they can find ways to support them. That's also a valid point. For example, some families manage with lower incomes, relying on community support, government assistance, or creative budgeting. Plus, children often don't perceive financial difficulties the same way adults do, and emotional support is crucial regardless of income.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing. The key here is whether the author is being judgmental or if they have a reasonable basis for their opinion. The author mentions wanting to plan financially, which is a responsible approach. Their girlfriend agrees, so they're being practical. However, their parents and friends are pushing back by saying money shouldn't be a factor. \n\nThe \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) questions often hinge on whether the person's actions or attitudes are unreasonably harsh or dismissive. The author is stating their belief that financial stability is important, not necessarily belittling those who can't afford kids. They might be right in wanting to prepare, but if they're implying that people in lower financial situations shouldn't have kids, that could be seen as judgmental. However, the original statement is about their own decision, not others. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for valuing financial stability when planning a family. It's a personal choice and a common concern. The friends and parents might be right in emphasizing that money isn't everything, but the author's reasoning is also valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate perspective on ensuring they can provide for their child's needs, which is part of responsible parenting.\n"
