I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, emphasizing financial stability to support a child. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The friends and family argue that money isn't a factor, which could be based on the idea that love and care are more important. The author, however, sees financial stability as crucial to avoid long-term issues for the child. The key here is whether financial considerations are valid in the decision to have a child.\n\nFinancial stability can indeed impact a child's quality of life, access to education, healthcare, and opportunities. While it's true that love and emotional support are fundamental, financial hardship can create stress and limit resources. The author's concern is practical and realistic. On the other hand, the friends might be emphasizing that money isn't the only factor, which is also true. However, the author isn't dismissing other factors; they're highlighting the importance of financial planning.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Since both sides have valid points, but the author is not dismissing other aspects entirely, it's more about differing priorities. The author isn't wrong for considering money, as it's a legitimate factor. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
