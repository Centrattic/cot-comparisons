      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is arguing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend (who is 22) think financial stability is crucial. They discuss how expensive raising a kid is and that being unable to support a child financially can cause long-term issues. The question is whether the author is the asshole for disagreeing with the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider common advice about having children. I remember that many experts do recommend financial stability as part of being ready for a child. Financial readiness is often cited as a key factor because of the costs involved in healthcare, education, housing, etc. So the author's stance seems reasonable. \n\nBut maybe the friends and parents are emphasizing other aspects like emotional readiness, love, or support systems. They might be saying that money isn't the only factor, which is true. However, the author is saying that money does matter, which isn't conflicting with that\u2014it's just part of the equation. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Since financial issues can lead to stress and affect a child's well-being, the author's concern is valid. Arguing against the idea that money is irrelevant isn't being an asshole; it's being realistic. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying the issue. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasoning is sound. They're not dismissing emotions or other factors, just emphasizing financial preparedness. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
