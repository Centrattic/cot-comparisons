I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for disagreeing with the idea that money doesn't matter when having kids. The author's parents and friends say money isn't relevant, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial. The author argues that financial stability helps provide for the child and prevent long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether money actually plays a role in raising a child. Common sense says it does\u2014kids need food, healthcare, education, etc. Lack of money can lead to stress, which affects the child's well-being. Studies also show that economic stability impacts child development.\n\nThe author's friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and emotional support are more important than money. While that's true, dismissing financial planning entirely could be problematic. It's possible to have both. The author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's an important factor. They want to be prepared to provide, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author is standing by their belief that financial stability is necessary, which is a valid perspective. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
