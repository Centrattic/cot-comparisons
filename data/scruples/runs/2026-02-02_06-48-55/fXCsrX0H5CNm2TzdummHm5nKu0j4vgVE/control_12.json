      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They argue that financial stability is crucial to avoid long-term issues for the child.\n\nHmm, so the main point here is whether financial considerations are valid when deciding to have a child. The author's stance is that you should plan financially, which makes sense from a practical standpoint. Raising a child is expensive, and being unable to support them could lead to stress, poor care, or negative impacts on the child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's social circle is saying money isn't part of the equation. That's a bit idealistic. While love and relationships are important, ignoring financial aspects isn't realistic. Most people would agree that having a child without the means to support them is irresponsible. \n\nThe author isn't dismissing emotions or love, just acknowledging financial responsibility. Their girlfriend agrees, so their perspective is shared. The argument here is about practicality versus idealism. The author is standing by a logical approach, so they're not the asshole for thinking that money matters. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
