      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend, who are 23 and 22 respectively, want to wait until they're financially stable. Their parents and friends argue that money isn't important for having a child. The author is telling them that money does matter and that planning financially is important to provide for the child. The question is if the author is the asshole (ITA) for disagreeing with the \"money doesn't matter\" stance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The main point of contention is whether financial stability is a valid consideration when deciding to have children. The author and girlfriend believe it's important, while their friends and family don't. \n\nI should consider common societal views. While some people might argue that love and care are more important than money, it's also a well-known fact that financial stability can affect a child's upbringing. There are studies and common knowledge that financial stress can impact family dynamics and a child's well-being. So the author's perspective is based on practical concerns.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning: they want to plan and ensure they can provide for the child. This is a responsible stance. Raising a child is expensive, and not having the means can lead to stress and difficulties. The author's friends and family dismissing money's role could be seen as naive or not considering real-world challenges.\n\nThe girlfriend agrees with the author, which shows they're on the same page. The friends and parents are advising them to ignore financial factors, which might not be the best advice. The key here is whether the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, wanting to be prepared is not wrong. People often plan major life events, including having children, based on their ability to provide. Dismissing financial considerations as irrelevant might not be realistic. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's an important one. \n\nLooking at the AITA format, the user is usually seeking validation that they're not the asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. Given that financial stability is a legitimate concern, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). Their friends and family's advice might be well-intentioned but overlook practical aspects. The author is making a responsible decision, so they aren't the asshole here.\n"
