We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for thinking that money matters when having a kid. The parents and friends say money doesn't matter, but the author and his girlfriend disagree, planning to wait until they're financially stable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common viewpoints. On one hand, some people argue that love, support, and emotional readiness are more important than financial status. They might believe that children can be raised well regardless of income. On the other hand, there's the practical side: kids cost a lot. From healthcare to education, financial stability can reduce stress and provide better opportunities. The author mentions long-term issues from not being financially ready, which makes sense. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for disagreeing. The term \"asshole\" here is subjective. If the author is being dismissive or judgmental towards others' views, that could be an issue. But if he's standing by his decision based on practical reasons, he's not necessarily the asshole. The key is whether he's respecting others' differing opinions while having his own. The author's reasoning seems logical, so the answer is likely B.\n"
