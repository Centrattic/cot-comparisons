I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child.\n\nThe author (AITA) is arguing that money does matter, while their parents and friends say it doesn't. The author wants to wait until financially stable before having a kid. The girlfriend agrees. They discussed the costs and potential issues of not being able to support a child financially.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. The task is to choose between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's stance is reasonable. The author's position is that financial stability is important for providing for a child. Common advice often includes financial preparedness when considering parenthood. So the author's reasoning seems logical. \n\nThe friends and parents say money has no merit, which might be idealistic. While love and care are crucial, financial stability can affect a child's access to education, healthcare, etc. So the author isn't wrong to consider this. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing. Since the author is prioritizing practical aspects, it's a reasonable stance. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
