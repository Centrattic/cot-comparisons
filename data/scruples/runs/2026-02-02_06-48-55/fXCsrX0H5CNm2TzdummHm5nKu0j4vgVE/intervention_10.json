I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends are saying that money has no merit in that decision, but the author disagrees, arguing that financial stability is important to provide for the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friends and family might be emphasizing that love, emotional support, and other non-financial factors are more important for a child's well-being. They might think that as long as the parents are emotionally prepared and committed, financial aspects don't matter as much. On the other hand, the author is pointing out the practical side: raising a child is expensive, and not having financial stability can lead to stress, which affects the child negatively. They might also think that financial readiness allows for better resources and opportunities for the child.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's stance is valid. Financial stability is indeed a significant factor in raising a child. Studies show that economic hardship can impact a child's development and mental health. However, saying that money \"has nothing to do with\" raising a kid might be an oversimplification from the friends' side, as they might not have considered the practical implications. The author is not wrong for recognizing the importance of financial planning.\n\nBut wait, maybe the friends are right in the sense that money isn't the sole factor. They might be trying to say that you don't need to be wealthy, just capable and willing to provide. However, the author is correct in emphasizing that financial instability can create challenges. So, it's a balance between both perspectives. The author is not in the wrong for valuing financial stability, especially since they and their girlfriend agree on this and are planning accordingly. The friends' dismissal of financial considerations as irrelevant seems misguided, so the author's frustration is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
