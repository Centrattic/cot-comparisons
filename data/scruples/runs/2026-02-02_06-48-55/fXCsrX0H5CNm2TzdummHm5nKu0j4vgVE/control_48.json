I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees and wants to be financially stable first.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the role of money in having kids. The author and their girlfriend agree that financial stability is important to provide for the child. They discussed higher living costs and potential issues if you can't support a child financially. So they're prioritizing financial readiness, which is a common viewpoint. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. The friends and family say it doesn't, but the author thinks it does. Well, different people have different opinions. Some might argue that love and care matter more than money, but the author's concern is valid because financial instability can lead to stress and affect a child's well-being. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is the only factor, but that it's a significant one. They're not dismissing the other aspects, just emphasizing financial planning. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
