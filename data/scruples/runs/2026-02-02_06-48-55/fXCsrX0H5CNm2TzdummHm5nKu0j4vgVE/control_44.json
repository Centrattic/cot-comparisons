We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter when having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child and prevent long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal perspective. There's a common belief that love and care are more important than money in raising a child. But the author is pointing out the practical aspects\u2014costs of living, education, healthcare, etc.\u2014which are real and significant. Financial instability can lead to stress, which affects parenting and the child's well-being.\n\nNext, what do experts say? Studies often show that economic hardship can impact a child's development. Financial strain can limit access to resources like good schools, nutritious food, and safe living conditions. So there's merit to the author's point about planning financially.\n\nHowever, some might argue that with proper support systems, even those with less money can provide a good life. But the author is not saying money is everything, just that it's a crucial factor. The friends and parents might be emphasizing non-material aspects, but dismissing financial considerations entirely could be seen as ignoring practical realities.\n\nThe author's stance is that money does matter, which is a reasonable position. They're not saying it's the only factor, just that it's important to be stable. Their girlfriend agrees, so they're not acting alone. The key here is whether the author's position is unreasonable. Since financial stability is widely acknowledged as important, the author isn't in the wrong for valuing that aspect.\n"
