      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend think it's important to be financially stable before having a kid, while their parents and friends say money doesn't matter. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that the \"money doesn't matter\" idea is bullshit.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The author's argument is that financial stability is crucial to provide for a child. They mention the cost of living and potential long-term issues if you can't support the child. Their friends and parents seem to downplay the role of money. \n\nNow, I need to think if the author is wrong for that stance. Well, having a child is a significant financial commitment. It's common advice to be financially prepared before having kids. The costs of raising a child include not just the immediate expenses like medical care, but also ongoing costs like education, food, housing, etc. If a family isn't in a position to cover these, it can lead to stress, which can affect the child's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But that doesn't mean money is irrelevant. Even if you have love, you still need money to provide basic needs. So the author isn't wrong to prioritize financial stability. Their friends and parents might be dismissing a very real and practical aspect of parenting. \n\nThe author's stance seems reasonable. They're planning to have a kid once they can support them, which is a responsible approach. The fact that their girlfriend agrees adds that it's a mutual decision. The people telling them money doesn't matter might be idealizing the situation or not considering the practicalities. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a logical and realistic assessment. The answer should be B.\n"
