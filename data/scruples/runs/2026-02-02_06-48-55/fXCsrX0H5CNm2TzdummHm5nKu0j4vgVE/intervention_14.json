I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (AITA) is arguing with their parents and friends who say that money has nothing to do with deciding to have a kid. The author and their girlfriend believe that financial stability is important to provide for a child, and they're planning to wait until they're stable. The friends and parents are dismissing the financial aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is wrong. The key point here is whether financial considerations are relevant when deciding to have a child. The author is saying that money does matter, and the others are saying it doesn't. \n\nFinancial stability can affect a child's upbringing. Lack of money can lead to stress, inability to afford basic needs, education, healthcare, etc., which can have long-term effects on the child. The author is prioritizing planning and stability, which is a responsible approach. Their friends and parents might be emphasizing other factors like love, emotional readiness, or the ability to provide non-material support. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter. Arguably, the author isn't wrong. It's reasonable to consider financial aspects as part of being prepared to have a child. However, some might argue that while money is important, it's not the only factor, and that other factors can be more crucial. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. They agree with their girlfriend, so it's a mutual decision. The friends and parents are dismissing the financial aspect entirely, which the author finds illogical. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" test, the author is standing their ground on a reasonable belief. They're not being inconsiderate of others' opinions, just firm in their own. So, probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
