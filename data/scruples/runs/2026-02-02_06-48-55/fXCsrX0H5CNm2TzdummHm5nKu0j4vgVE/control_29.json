We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The parents and friends told them that money has no merit in the decision, but the author and their girlfriend disagree. They want to wait until they're financially stable to provide for the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The friends and parents are saying money isn't a factor, but the author is concerned about financial stability. The author's stance is that without enough money, it can lead to long-term issues for the child. \n\nFinancial stability is often cited as an important factor in raising a child. The cost of living, healthcare, education, etc., all require money. If a family can't support a child financially, it might lead to stress, inability to meet the child's needs, which could affect the child's well-being. So the author's reasoning seems valid here. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love and other factors are more important than money. However, the author isn't saying they don't love their potential child, just that they want to be financially stable. The friends and parents might be dismissing a real concern. \n\nThe key is that the author is planning, which is responsible. The people around them are not considering the practical aspects. The question is about whether the author's belief that money matters is wrong. Since the author's concern is about providing for the child's needs, it's a reasonable position. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
