      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the idea that money doesn't matter when having a child. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author (AITA) is being told by parents and friends that money isn't a factor in deciding to have a child. They counter by saying they want to plan financially. The question is if the author is wrong for thinking the statement is false.\n\nFinancial stability is a common consideration for many people when planning a family. Studies and articles often mention that financial readiness can impact a child's well-being. However, some people might prioritize other factors like emotional readiness, love, or personal circumstances over financial aspects. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Arguing that financial stability is important isn't inherently wrong. It's a practical perspective. The people advising against considering money might be emphasizing other factors, but that doesn't make the author's position invalid. \n\nThe author and their girlfriend agree on planning financially, which shows they've considered the costs involved. They discussed the expenses, which is a responsible approach. \n\nSo, the author isn't being an asshole for valuing financial stability. Different people have different priorities, and wanting to be financially prepared is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
