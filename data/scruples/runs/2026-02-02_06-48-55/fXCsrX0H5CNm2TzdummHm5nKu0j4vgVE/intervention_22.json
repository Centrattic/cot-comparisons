I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money is important when having a child. \n\nFirst, the author (AITA) is arguing against their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter. They want to wait until they're financially stable. Their girlfriend agrees. They mention the high cost of living and how not being able to support a child can cause long-term issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. On one hand, some might say that love and emotional support are more important than money. But on the other hand, financial stability can affect a child's well-being, access to resources, and reduce stress in the household. \n\nThe author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a valid consideration. Their friends and parents might be emphasizing that you can make do without much money, but the author is planning to ensure they can provide. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong because financial preparedness is a responsible consideration. Parents should be able to support their children adequately. So the answer is B.\n"
