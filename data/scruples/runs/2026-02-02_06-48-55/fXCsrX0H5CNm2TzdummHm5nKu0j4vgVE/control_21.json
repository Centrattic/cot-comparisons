      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The scenario is that the author's parents and friends are saying money doesn't matter, but the author and their girlfriend believe financial stability is important. They argue that not having enough money could lead to long-term issues for the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments presented. The author's stance is that financial stability is crucial for providing for a child, covering costs like living expenses, education, healthcare, etc. Their friends and family dismiss this view, saying money isn't a factor. The author feels their valid concerns are being ignored.\n\nI should consider common societal opinions. Many people do argue that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. Lack of resources can lead to stress, inability to meet basic needs, and other challenges. On the other hand, some might say that love and support are more important than money. However, the author's point is about planning and responsibility, not about money being the sole factor. They mention wanting to be financially stable to provide, which is a reasonable and responsible approach.\n\nThe friends and parents' argument that money has \"no merit\" might be oversimplifying. While it's true that money alone doesn't guarantee a good upbringing, it's also a practical consideration. The author and girlfriend are not dismissing other factors but emphasizing financial responsibility. Their reasoning seems logical and responsible, especially since they're planning to wait until they can support a child properly. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being selfish or ignoring other aspects of parenting. They're focusing on a practical aspect that many experts in child development would agree is important. Therefore, the author's position here is reasonable, and their friends and family might be downplaying a valid concern. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for thinking money matters in this context.\n"
