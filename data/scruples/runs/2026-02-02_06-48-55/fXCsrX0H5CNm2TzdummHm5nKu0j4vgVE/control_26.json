      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is male, 23, and his girlfriend is 22. They both want to wait until they're financially stable to have a child. Their parents and friends are saying that money isn't a factor, but the author argues that not being able to support a child financially can lead to long-term issues. The main question is if he's an asshole for disagreeing with those who downplay money's role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice on this topic. Many experts and common sense do suggest that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. Children have needs like food, housing, education, healthcare, and so on, which all cost money. If a family is struggling financially, it can lead to stress, which affects parenting and the child's environment. So the author's stance aligns with a lot of real-world evidence and recommendations.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more crucial than money. However, the author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. He's not dismissing the importance of other factors but is emphasizing financial stability as a necessary component. His girlfriend agrees, which suggests mutual consent and shared planning, which is a responsible approach.\n\nThe people advising him (parents and friends) might be coming from a place of idealism, thinking that with enough love, money isn't a problem. But in reality, financial strain can't be ignored. It's reasonable for the author to want to plan and ensure they can provide for the child's needs. The key here is that he's not being selfish; he's aiming to avoid hardship for the child and the family.\n\nThe term \"asshole\" in the AITA context usually refers to someone who's unreasonably difficult or wrong in their stance. In this case, the author is being practical. There's no indication he's pressuring his girlfriend or ignoring her feelings. They're in agreement. The parents and friends might not be considering the practical realities, so the author isn't in the wrong for standing by his decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
