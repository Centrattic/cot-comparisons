I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends say money has no merit in this decision, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. The author and their girlfriend agree on this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love, emotional readiness, and support are more important than money. They might say that you can't put a price on parenting. On the other hand, financial stability can affect a child's access to necessities like healthcare, education, and a safe environment. Being financially unstable could lead to stress and challenges for both parents and the child.\n\nThe author is planning to wait until they're financially stable, which seems responsible. They're considering the long-term impact on the child. Their friends and family might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial aspects, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for prioritizing money. It's a personal choice based on their values and circumstances.\n\nI should also think about common advice. Many sources do recommend financial preparedness as part of being ready for a child. High costs of raising a child, including healthcare, education, and daily living expenses, are real factors. The author and their partner are acknowledging these costs, which is prudent.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a decision based on practical considerations. Their friends and family might have different perspectives, but that doesn't invalidate the author's stance. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
