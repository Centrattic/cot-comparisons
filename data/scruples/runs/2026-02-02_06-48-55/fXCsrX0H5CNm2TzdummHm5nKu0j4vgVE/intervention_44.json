I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person posted an AITA question where they're arguing with their parents and friends about whether money matters when having a child. The author thinks it's important to be financially stable first, while friends and parents say money isn't a factor. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that money does matter.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. They want an answer of A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The core issue is whether financial stability is a valid consideration in deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable, which seems responsible. The friends and parents are dismissing the importance of money, which the author argues is a key factor in providing for a child.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often a debate about this. Some people argue that love and parental care are more important than money, but others stress that financial resources are crucial for a child's well-being. The author is taking a practical stance, emphasizing the financial aspects as essential for the child's future. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong in their stance. If the friends and parents are saying that money has no merit, they might be oversimplifying. While it's true that you don't need a lot of money to love a child, financial stability can prevent stress, ensure access to healthcare, education, and basic needs. \n\nThe author isn't denying the importance of love or emotional support, just pointing out that financial readiness is a practical aspect. So, if the friends and parents are dismissing the author's valid concerns, they might be the ones not considering the practicalities. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for valuing financial stability as a consideration. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
