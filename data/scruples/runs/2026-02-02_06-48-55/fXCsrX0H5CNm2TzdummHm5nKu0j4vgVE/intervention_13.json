      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter when having a child. The author wants to wait until they're financially stable.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author (AITA) is arguing that money does matter, and their parents and friends say it doesn't. The author and their girlfriend agree they want to plan financially before having a kid. They mention the cost of living and potential issues if they can't support the child. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the \"money doesn't matter\" statement is wrong.\n\nI should consider common arguments on both sides. On one hand, people might say that while money helps, it's not the only factor\u2014love, support, time, etc., are also crucial. On the other hand, financial stability can provide a more secure environment for the child, reducing stress and ensuring basic needs are met. There's research that financial stability impacts child outcomes, but it's not the sole factor.\n\nThe author's friends and family might be emphasizing that with love and commitment, you can raise a child even without much money. But the author is taking a more practical approach, acknowledging the financial challenges. The key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability. \n\nSince the question is about being an asshole, the tone might be more about whether the author is dismissive of others' opinions. If the author is respectful but firm in their stance, maybe not. But if they're belittling others' views, that's another issue. The original scenario doesn't indicate that the author is being rude, just that they disagree. \n\nSo, given that the author is acting in the child's best interest by planning financially, and the friends/parents might be oversimplifying, the author's position seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
