I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's friends and family are saying money isn't important, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The author's stance is about financial stability to avoid long-term issues for the child. Common sense and many experts suggest that financial readiness can impact a child's well-being. So, the author's reasoning seems valid.\n\nThe friends and parents might argue that love and emotional support are more crucial than money. While that's true, financial stability can affect access to education, healthcare, and a stable environment. It's not about money being the only factor, but a necessary component.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing financial stability? Probably not. It's responsible planning. The friends might be oversimplifying the situation. The author isn't dismissing other factors, just emphasizing financial readiness. So, the author's position isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
