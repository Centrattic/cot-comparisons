      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for believing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, thinking financial stability is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author and their girlfriend think that being financially stable is essential to provide for a child, citing higher living costs and potential long-term issues if not prepared. Their friends and family dismiss money's role in the decision. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to prioritize financial stability. Common advice often suggests that having a child when you can afford it is important. On the other hand, some argue that love and commitment are more important than money. However, the practical aspect can't be ignored; kids do incur significant expenses from birth through education. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. Arguably, wanting to plan for a child's future financially is a responsible stance. The friends' dismissal might be naive or overlook real-world challenges. So, the author's position seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
