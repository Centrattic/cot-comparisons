      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is being told by their parents and friends that money shouldn't matter when deciding to have a child. The author disagrees, saying they want to be financially stable first to provide for the child, and their girlfriend agrees. They argue that not being financially ready can cause long-term issues. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking the \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" statement is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author's stance is valid. The key point here is whether financial stability is a legitimate consideration when planning to have children. The author's friends and family are making a statement that money doesn't matter, which seems counterintuitive because raising a child is expensive. The author is countering that by emphasizing financial preparedness to avoid negative impacts on the child.\n\nI know that in many cultures and from a practical standpoint, financial stability is often cited as an important factor in raising a child. The costs of childcare, healthcare, education, and basic necessities can be significant. Not having financial resources can lead to stress, which can affect the child's well-being. So the author's concern is reasonable and based on real-world considerations.\n\nThe friends and parents who say money doesn't matter might be emphasizing other aspects like love, time, and emotional support. However, dismissing financial considerations entirely could be seen as ignoring practical realities. The author isn't saying money is everything, but that it's an important factor. This is a common debate, and the author's perspective aligns with many experts who advise financial planning before having children.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing. Since financial stability is a legitimate concern, and the author is planning to wait until they can provide adequately, they aren't being unreasonable. The friends and parents might be prioritizing different values, but the author's stance is valid and responsible. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
