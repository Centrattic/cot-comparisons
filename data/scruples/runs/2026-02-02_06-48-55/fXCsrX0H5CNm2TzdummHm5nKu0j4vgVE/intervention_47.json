      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when considering having a child. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend are planning to have a kid once they're financially stable, while their parents and friends argue that money isn't important.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is emphasizing financial stability as a prerequisite for having a child, whereas others in their circle are dismissing financial considerations. The question is whether the author's stance is wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money in raising a child, and that financial stability isn't a requirement. On the other hand, the author is concerned about the practical aspects\u2014like being able to afford basic needs, healthcare, education, etc.\u2014which can impact a child's well-being.\n\nThe author mentions that they discussed the higher costs of living and potential issues if a child is born when the parents can't support them. This suggests they are thinking about the long-term implications, which is a responsible approach. However, their friends and family might be making a point that financial instability shouldn't deter people from having kids, perhaps because it's not the only factor, or because they believe people can manage with less.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the statement in question is \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid.\" The author is arguing against that, pointing out that money does matter. From a practical standpoint, financial resources do affect the quality of life a child can have. However, it's also true that many children grow up in financially modest households and still thrive with adequate love and support. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's perspective is valid. They are not wrong for considering financial stability as important. In fact, planning financially is often recommended by experts when preparing for parenthood. The friends and family might be making a philosophical or ideological point, but the author's concern is practical and realistic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money has no merit in this decision.\n"
