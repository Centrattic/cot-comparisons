      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when having a kid. The author argues that financial stability is important, while their parents and friends say money has no merit. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is saying that they and their girlfriend want to wait until they're financially stable to have a child. They mention the high costs of living and the potential issues if a child isn't supported financially. Their friends and family disagree, saying money isn't a factor. The author feels their concern is valid and is asking if they're the asshole for thinking that money does matter.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to think financial stability is important. From what I know, raising a child involves significant expenses\u2014not just initial costs, but ongoing things like healthcare, education, housing, etc. There's also the stress and potential issues that come with financial instability, which can affect the child's well-being. Studies and common advice often suggest that parents should be in a good financial position before having kids to avoid these problems.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that love, emotional support, and a stable home environment are more crucial than money. They might say that children can thrive even in modest circumstances because of strong relationships and emotional security. But the author is specifically pointing out the financial aspect as a key factor, which many people do agree on.\n\nThe friends and family might be emphasizing that money isn't everything, which is true. But the author is saying that money is a necessary factor, not that it's the only one. It seems like there's a difference in perspective here. The author isn't dismissing other factors like love or support; they're highlighting the importance of financial stability. Since financial issues are a major concern in parenting, the author's stance is reasonable. Therefore, they're not in the wrong for thinking money matters. The answer should be B.\n"
