I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author argues that financial stability is necessary to provide for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this. Having a child is a significant financial commitment, including costs for healthcare, education, housing, etc. There's a lot of evidence that financial stress can impact a child's well-being, not just the parents'. \n\nThe author's stance is that planning financially is responsible. Their girlfriend agrees, which suggests mutual support. The friends and parents might be emphasizing that love and emotional support are more crucial, but that doesn't negate the practical aspects. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to disagree. Since the author is prioritizing financial stability to avoid long-term issues, and friends are dismissing that, the author is likely not the asshole. Their reasoning is practical and supports the child's future. So the answer should be B.\n"
