We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

Their parents and friends say money has no merit in the decision, but the author and their girlfriend want to wait until they're financially stable.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than financial stability. They might say that you can't predict the future and that waiting too long could prevent having children when the time is right. But on the other hand, the author is concerned about providing for the child, which is a common and valid point. Kids do require a lot of resources, and being financially unprepared can lead to stress and difficulties. The girlfriend agrees, so they're on the same page.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money doesn't matter. The friends and family might be coming from a place of idealism, thinking that parenting is about more than money. But realistically, financial stability does play a role in being able to care for a child's needs, whether it's basic necessities or future opportunities. The author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a responsible approach. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
