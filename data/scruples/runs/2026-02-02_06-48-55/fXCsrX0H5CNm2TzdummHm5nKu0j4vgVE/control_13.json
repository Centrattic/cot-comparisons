      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The parents and friends say money has no merit in the decision, but the author and their girlfriend disagree, wanting to be financially stable first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's stance is that financial stability is important to provide for the child, which is a common argument. People often say that kids shouldn't be a financial burden, and that stability helps the child's well-being. On the other hand, the friends and parents might be emphasizing other aspects like love, emotional readiness, or that financial needs can be managed with support from others.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for dismissing the opinion that money isn't a factor. The key here is whether the author's argument is valid. Financial stability can indeed impact a child's life, affecting access to education, healthcare, and overall quality of life. However, some might argue that financial struggles can be overcome with community support, government aid, or that love is more important than money. \n\nBut the author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a significant one. They're advocating for planning and stability, which is a reasonable approach. The friends' view that money has \"nothing to do with it\" seems extreme, as financial considerations are practical realities. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Their reasoning makes sense in the context of responsible parenting. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
