      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't important, while the author and his girlfriend believe financial stability is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments on both sides. On one hand, some people argue that love and care are more important than money when raising a child. On the other hand, financial stability can impact a child's access to education, healthcare, and a safe environment. The author mentions the high costs of living and potential long-term issues if a child isn't supported financially.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and what's generally advised. Many experts do recommend financial preparedness before having children, as economic stress can affect parenting and the child's well-being. The author and his girlfriend are planning, which is a responsible approach.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for disagreeing with the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement. The friends and family might be emphasizing emotional readiness, which is valid, but dismissing financial aspects as \"bullshit\" could be seen as dismissive. However, the author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a significant factor.\n\nI need to decide if the author's stance is unreasonable. Since financial stability is a legitimate concern and there's evidence supporting its importance, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The friends might be oversimplifying by saying money isn't a factor. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
