I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when considering having a child. The author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, thinking financial stability is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author argues that being financially stable is important to provide for a child. Their friends and parents say money isn't a factor. The question is if the author is wrong for disagreeing.\n\nI should consider common perspectives. Many people do think financial stability is important for raising a child. It's about being able to afford basic needs, education, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, some might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money. But the author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a factor.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that not having financial stability can cause long-term issues for the child. That makes sense. Studies do show that economic hardship can affect a child's well-being. So the author's stance seems reasonable.\n\nThe friends and parents might be emphasizing that money isn't the only factor, which is true. But the author isn't dismissing other factors; they're just highlighting the importance of financial aspects. It's a matter of disagreement, not necessarily being wrong.\n\nSo, the author's position isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on practical considerations. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
