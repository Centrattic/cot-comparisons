      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't important, but the author and his girlfriend believe financial stability is crucial. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, people often say that love and care are more important than money in raising a child. They might argue that with proper support and resources, even those with less money can provide a good life. On the other hand, financial stability can affect access to healthcare, education, and a safe living environment, which are all important for a child's well-being.\n\nThe author's point about planning to be financially stable before having a child makes sense because financial stress can impact parenting and the child's upbringing. The example given about the costs of living and potential long-term issues if a child isn't supported financially is valid. However, the friends and family might be emphasizing emotional readiness and support over financial aspects.\n\nI need to check if the author's stance is dismissive or if there's a misunderstanding. The author isn't saying money is the only factor but that it's a significant one. The friends might be oversimplifying the situation. In reality, both financial and emotional aspects are important. The author's concern about financial stability leading to better outcomes isn't wrong. Studies do show that economic hardship can affect child development. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for valuing financial preparedness. However, it's also important to acknowledge that money isn't the sole determinant of a child's well-being. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being an asshole by dismissing others' opinions. The author is stating their belief based on practical considerations, which is reasonable. The friends are also sharing their perspective. Neither side is entirely right or wrong; it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't being inconsiderate but is standing by their reasoning. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
