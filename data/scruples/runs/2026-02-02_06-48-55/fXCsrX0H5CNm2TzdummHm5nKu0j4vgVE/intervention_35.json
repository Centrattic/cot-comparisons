We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money doesn't matter when having a child. The author and their girlfriend are young (M23 and F22) and they want to wait until they're financially stable. Their friends and parents say money isn't important, but the author thinks it's crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common advice about having children. Financial stability is often cited as important for a child's well-being. Being in a stable financial position can reduce stress for parents, provide better opportunities for the child, and ensure basic needs are met. On the other hand, some people might argue that love and emotional support are more important than money, but that's more of a philosophical stance.\n\nThe author's reasoning is practical. They're planning for the future and considering the costs of living, which is a responsible approach. Friends and parents who say money doesn't matter might be downplaying the real challenges. However, the author isn't dismissing the importance of love or relationships; they're just emphasizing financial readiness. \n\nIs the author wrong for valuing financial stability? Probably not. It's a valid perspective. The question is whether they're the asshole for thinking the statement is \"bullshit.\" Most people would agree that money does play a role, so the author isn't in the wrong here. The friends and parents might have their own views, but the author's stance is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
