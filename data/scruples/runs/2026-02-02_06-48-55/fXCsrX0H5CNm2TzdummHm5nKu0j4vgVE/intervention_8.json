      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they argue that money is important when deciding to have a child, against their parents and friends who say money has no merit. The author and their girlfriend think financial stability matters because of the costs involved. They mention costs of living and potential issues if a child isn't supported financially. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the disagreement. On one side, the author and girlfriend believe financial stability is crucial for a child's well-being. On the other side, friends and family say money isn't a factor. Which perspective is more valid?\n\nFinancially supporting a child is a big responsibility. There's evidence that poverty can affect a child's development, access to education, healthcare, etc. So, wanting to be stable before having a child seems reasonable. However, some people might argue that love and other resources (emotional support, community) are more important than money. But the author is pointing out the practical costs\u2014like childcare, education, medical expenses\u2014which are real and substantial.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize financial stability? If someone is in a position to provide better resources, maybe they're giving the child a better start. However, others might say that you can still have a child even if you're not super wealthy, and that other factors matter more. But the author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by insisting that money matters. The friends and family might be dismissing valid concerns. The author is not saying money is everything, just that it's a significant factor. So, the author's stance is based on practical considerations rather than just emotional ones. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" if the author is being dismissive or arrogant, maybe. But the way the situation is described, they're just stating their position. The friends and family are saying money has nothing to do with it, which might be an oversimplification. The author's point is that financial stability affects the child's quality of life. So, the author isn't wrong in thinking money matters; it's a valid concern. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
