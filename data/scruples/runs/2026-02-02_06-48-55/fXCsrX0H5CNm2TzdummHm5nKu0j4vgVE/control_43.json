I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for believing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author's parents and friends argue that money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is crucial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this topic. Many people do believe that financial readiness is a significant factor in raising a child. It's often cited as important for providing basic needs, education, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, others might emphasize emotional readiness or support systems over financial aspects.\n\nThe author is countering the idea that money has no merit. They mention planning to wait until financially stable, which seems responsible. The friends and family are pushing a different view, but the author stands by their reasoning. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, there's no single \"right\" answer here. Different people have different values. However, the author is making a valid point that financial stability can prevent long-term issues for the child. Arguing against the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" isn't necessarily wrong because it's a realistic concern. So the author isn't in the wrong for holding that belief. The answer should be B.\n"
