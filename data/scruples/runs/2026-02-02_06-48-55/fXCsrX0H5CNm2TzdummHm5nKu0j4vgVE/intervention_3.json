I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a kid. The author's parents and friends are saying money has no merit in the decision, but the author and their girlfriend disagree, planning to wait until financially stable. They mention the costs of living and potential issues if you can't support a child.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the argument. The author is emphasizing financial stability as important for raising a child. The counter is that money isn't a factor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance.\n\nFinancial stability can definitely impact a child's well-being. There's research that financial stress can affect parenting and a child's development. So, the author's concern seems valid. They're not saying money is the only factor, but that it's a significant one. The friends and parents might be advocating for other aspects like love, time, etc., but the author is prioritizing financial readiness.\n\nIs there a reason to think the author is wrong? Maybe if someone argues that money isn't everything, but the author isn't dismissing other factors entirely. They're just highlighting the importance of money. Since they're planning to be financially stable, their approach is responsible. The friends and parents' perspective is that money isn't a factor, but the author's stance is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
