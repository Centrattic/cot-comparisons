I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they disagree with the statement that money has nothing to do with raising a kid. The parents and friends are saying money isn't a factor, but the author and their girlfriend are planning to wait until they're financially stable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author's argument is that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. Their family and friends are dismissing that idea. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's stance on financial readiness for having a child versus others saying money doesn't matter. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding that belief. \n\nFinancial stability can definitely impact a child's upbringing\u2014access to education, healthcare, basic needs, etc. But some might argue that love and resources beyond money are more important. The author isn't saying they can't afford a child but that they want to plan and be stable. Their girlfriend agrees, so it's a mutual decision. \n\nThe term \"asshole\" here is about being unreasonable. The author is being responsible, which is generally seen as good. The friends and parents might be idealizing the idea of parenthood beyond material aspects. But the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial preparedness. \n\nThere's no mention of the author being dismissive of other factors, just that they disagree with the idea that money is irrelevant. The argument is about planning and providing for a child's needs. So, likely the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
