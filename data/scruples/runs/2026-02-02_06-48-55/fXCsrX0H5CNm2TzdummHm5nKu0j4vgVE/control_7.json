I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable before having a kid. They argue that not being able to support a child can cause long-term issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's position. Common advice suggests that financial stability is important for a child's well-being. There's a lot of research showing that economic hardship can affect a child's development, access to education, healthcare, etc. So the author's concern is reasonable.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is standing by their belief when others are dismissing financial considerations. The friends and parents might be emphasizing emotional readiness or other factors, but that doesn't negate the importance of financial stability. The author isn't being dismissive of other aspects, just emphasizing money's role. \n\nIs there any point where the author is being unreasonable? Maybe if they were saying money is the only factor, but the statement is that money's role is significant. The friends' assertion that money has \"nothing to do\" seems extreme. Even if other factors matter, financial stability is a critical component. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
