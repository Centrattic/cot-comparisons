I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's parents and friends say money has no merit in the decision, but the author disagrees, wanting to be financially stable first. They also mention the cost of living and potential issues if you can't support a child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. First, I need to determine if the author is wrong for valuing financial stability. The friends and parents are saying money doesn't matter, but the author is concerned about providing for the child. From a common-sense perspective, financial stability is often considered important for a child's well-being. High costs of raising a child can lead to stress and difficulties if not planned for. So the author's stance seems reasonable.\n\nBut maybe the friends and parents are making a moral point\u2014like, love and support are more important than money. However, the author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's a necessary part. The question is whether the author is wrong for emphasizing financial stability. Since the author is planning and considering practical aspects, it's not unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
