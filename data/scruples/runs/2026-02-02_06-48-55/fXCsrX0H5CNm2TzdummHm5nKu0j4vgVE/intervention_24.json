I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The author is arguing against their parents and friends who say money doesn't matter. The author believes financial stability is important to provide for a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author and their girlfriend are planning to have a child once they're financially stable. They discussed the high costs of living and potential issues if they can't support the child. The friends and parents are saying money isn't important, but the author disagrees. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. \n\nFinancial stability is a common concern when planning for a child. Many people argue that having enough money ensures the child's needs are met, education, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, some might say that love and support are more important than money. But the author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. \n\nThe friends and parents might be idealistic, thinking that with enough love, money isn't an issue. However, the author's point is practical: not having enough money can lead to stress and problems for the family. \n\nIs the author wrong to prioritize financial stability? Probably not. It's a practical consideration. The friends and parents might be dismissing a valid concern. So the author isn't in the wrong for thinking money matters. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
