I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The author's parents and friends say money has no merit in deciding to have a kid. The author disagrees and wants to wait until they're financially stable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The friends and family argue that money isn't important for raising a child. But the author is concerned about providing for the child's needs, which they see as a financial responsibility. Childcare, medical expenses, education, and general living costs are significant. Not being financially stable can lead to stress and affect the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that love and support are more important than money. But realistically, financial instability can create challenges. The author is planning and responsible, which is generally seen as prudent. Their girlfriend agrees, so it's a mutual decision. The author isn't dismissing the emotional aspects but is focusing on practical support. The friends' advice seems dismissive of real financial hardships. So, the author's stance is reasonable and not in the wrong.\n"
