I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author and their girlfriend think financial stability is important. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friends and family say money isn't a factor, while the author argues that being financially stable is necessary to support a child. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters.\n\nI know that having a child involves many responsibilities, and financial stability can affect the child's well-being. Lack of money can lead to stress, inability to provide basic needs, education, healthcare, etc. So the author's concern is valid. On the other hand, some might say that love and commitment are more important than money. But the author is planning to be stable first, which is a responsible approach.\n\nThe friends and family might be downplaying the financial aspect, maybe thinking that people can manage without much money. But realistically, financial issues are a major cause of stress in families. So the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
