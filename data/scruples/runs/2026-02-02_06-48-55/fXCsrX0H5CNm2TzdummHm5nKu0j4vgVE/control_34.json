I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with the statement that money has nothing to do with deciding to have a child.\n\nSo, the author's parents and friends say money isn't a factor when having a kid. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for the child and avoid long-term issues. They mention the cost of living and planning until they're financially stable. Their girlfriend agrees. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the money statement is nonsense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common viewpoints. Many people argue that while money isn't the only factor, it's definitely a significant one. Children have needs like food, housing, healthcare, education, which all cost money. Being financially stable can reduce stress and provide better opportunities for the child. On the other hand, some might say that love, emotional support, and good parenting are more crucial than money. However, the author's stance is about planning and providing, which is reasonable.\n\nThe friends and parents might be emphasizing that you don't need wealth to raise a child, that love and effort matter more. But the author is pointing out practical realities. So, the author isn't wrong for valuing financial stability as part of the decision. It's a valid perspective. The answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong because they're making a practical argument based on the real costs involved in raising a child. It's not an either/or situation; both money and other factors matter, but the author is justified in considering financial aspects.\n"
