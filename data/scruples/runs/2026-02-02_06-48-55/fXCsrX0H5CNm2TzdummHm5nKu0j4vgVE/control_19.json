I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The parents and friends are saying money isn't important, but the author disagrees because they want to be financially stable first.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out if the author's stance is wrong. Well, having a child is a big responsibility. Money affects a lot of things like healthcare, education, and basic needs. The author's argument is that being financially stable helps provide for the child better, which makes sense. Their girlfriend agrees too, so that's a point in their favor.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe their parents and friends are emphasizing that love and care are more important than money. But even so, financial stability can reduce stress and contribute to a better environment for the child. The author isn't saying money is everything, just that it's a factor. The question is whether they're wrong for considering money. I don't think so because it's a practical concern. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
