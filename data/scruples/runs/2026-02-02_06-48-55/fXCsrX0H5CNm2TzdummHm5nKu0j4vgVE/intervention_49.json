I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is saying that having a child definitely relates to money, and they're upset that their parents and friends insist money isn't important. The author wants to wait until they're financially stable, which their girlfriend agrees with. They argue that not having enough money can lead to long-term issues for the child. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) for thinking the \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" statement is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the friends and family might be emphasizing that love, emotional support, and commitment are more important than financial stability. They might believe that with love and dedication, even financial challenges can be overcome. But on the other hand, the author is pointing out the practical realities\u2014children need basic necessities, healthcare, education, which all cost money. Financial instability can lead to stress, which affects the child's well-being. There's also the argument that planning and stability reduce the risk of neglect or hardship.\n\nI remember that studies show financial stress can impact parenting quality. It's not just about having enough money, but also about the stress that comes with financial insecurity. The author's position seems reasonable because they're acknowledging the importance of being prepared financially, which is a responsible stance. Their friends and family might be right that love is crucial, but dismissing the financial aspect entirely might be naive.\n\nThe author isn't saying love isn't important, just that money is a factor. They're not in denial about the non-financial aspects but are insisting that financial stability is necessary. Their friends might be in the wrong for oversimplifying the issue. So, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
