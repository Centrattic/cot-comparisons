I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money matters when deciding to have a child. The parents and friends are saying that money has no merit in that decision, but the author and their girlfriend disagree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common advice around having children. There's a lot of emphasis on financial stability when it comes to raising a kid. Childcare, healthcare, education, and daily living expenses can add up. Being financially stable can reduce stress and provide a better environment for the child. So, the author's concern about financial readiness is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the people advising them might be emphasizing that love, emotional support, and a nurturing environment are more important than money. They might be right in that money isn't everything, but it's a practical consideration. The author is not saying money is the only factor, just that it's an important one. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Since financial responsibility is often recommended as part of family planning, the author's stance seems reasonable. They're not dismissing the importance of love or emotional aspects, just making a case for financial preparedness. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their reasoning is based on practical considerations that are commonly acknowledged in family planning.\n"
