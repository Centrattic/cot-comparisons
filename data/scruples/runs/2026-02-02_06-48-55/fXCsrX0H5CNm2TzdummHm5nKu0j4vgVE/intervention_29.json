I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that money does matter when having a child. The situation is that the author's parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend believe financial stability is crucial. The author is arguing that not having enough money can lead to long-term issues for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. On one side, the author and girlfriend prioritize financial stability to provide for the child, which seems responsible. On the other side, the parents and friends might be emphasizing other aspects like love, emotional readiness, or the idea that money isn't everything. But does that mean the author is wrong to value financial stability?\n\nThe question is whether the author's stance is wrong. The key here is that the author is not saying money is the only factor, but that it's a significant one. The parents and friends might be dismissing the financial aspect entirely, which the author disagrees with. Since the author is making a case for financial planning, which is a common and reasonable concern, it's hard to see them as in the wrong. Their argument is practical and based on real-life expenses, which are a valid consideration. The parents and friends might be oversimplifying the issue by saying money has nothing to do with it. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
