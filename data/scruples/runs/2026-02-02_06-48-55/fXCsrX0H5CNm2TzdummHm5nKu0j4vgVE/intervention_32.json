I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking money matters when having a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees, saying they want to be financially stable first. The question is whether the author is an asshole for this view.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's stance is reasonable. The author argues that financial stability is important to provide for a child, which seems logical. Kids do have significant financial needs, like education, healthcare, and basic living expenses. The girlfriend agrees with them, which supports their position.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents and friends might believe that love, emotional support, and other non-monetary factors are more crucial. But the author's point is about practical support, which is a valid concern. The key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability as a prerequisite for having a child.\n\nThe phrase \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is being challenged. The author is saying that's not true, which is a reasonable rebuttal given the actual costs involved. So, the author isn't wrong for thinking that financial readiness is a necessary consideration. They're not dismissing love or emotional aspects but emphasizing practicality.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Their argument is based on real-world financial realities, which are important aspects of child-rearing. The answer should be B (No).\n"
