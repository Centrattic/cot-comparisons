      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether money matters when deciding to have a child. The author and their girlfriend are in their 20s, and their parents and friends argue that money shouldn't be a factor. The author disagrees, thinking financial stability is important to provide for a child and avoid long-term issues. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for thinking that money does matter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's position is that financial stability is crucial for raising a child, which is a common concern. They mention discussing the high costs of living and potential issues if parents can't support their child. Their friends and family say money isn't a factor, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the idea that money has \"nothing to do with raising a kid\" seems extreme. While it's true that love and care are important, financial aspects do play a significant role in a child's well-being. The cost of childcare, education, healthcare, and basic needs can be substantial. Being financially stable can reduce stress for parents and provide a more stable environment for the child.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friends and family are emphasizing that money isn't the only factor. They might be trying to de-emphasize financial concerns to encourage the couple to have a child without delay. But the author is reasonable in wanting to be prepared. It's not wrong to consider financial stability as part of the decision. The statement that \"money has nothing to do with it\" seems to dismiss practical concerns, which the author is correctly pointing out.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a pragmatic argument that financial planning is important. The friends and family might be idealistic, but the author's stance is logical. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
