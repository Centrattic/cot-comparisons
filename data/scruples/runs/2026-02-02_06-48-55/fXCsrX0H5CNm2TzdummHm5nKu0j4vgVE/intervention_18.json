I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author and their girlfriend wanting to have a child once they're financially stable, but their parents and friends say money shouldn't matter. The author argues that financial stability is crucial to avoid long-term issues.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here are about financial responsibility versus the idea that money isn't a factor in raising a kid. The author's stance is that being financially stable is important to provide for the child, which seems logical. Their friends and family are dismissing the financial aspect, which the author disagrees with.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. Let me break it down. \n\nFinancial stability can impact a child's well-being. Studies show that economic hardship can affect a child's development and access to resources. So the author's concern is valid. On the other hand, some might argue that love and support are more important than money, but that doesn't negate the practical challenges money brings. \n\nThe friends and family might be emphasizing emotional readiness over financial, which is a different perspective. However, the author isn't saying money is everything, but that it's a necessary factor. The question is whether the author is wrong to think the \"money has nothing to do with it\" statement is incorrect. \n\nSince the author's reasoning is based on practical considerations and the potential negative impacts of financial instability, it's reasonable to say they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
