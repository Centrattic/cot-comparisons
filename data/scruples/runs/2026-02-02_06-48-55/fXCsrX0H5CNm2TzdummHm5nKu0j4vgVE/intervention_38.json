I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for arguing that money does matter when deciding to have a child. The scenario is that the author and their girlfriend, both in their early 20s, want to wait until they're financially stable. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author disagrees. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the argument from both sides. On one hand, people often say that having a child is about love and commitment, not just money. But on the other hand, financial stability can significantly impact a child's well-being. The author is planning responsibly, which seems reasonable. The friends and parents might not be considering the practical aspects, maybe because they had different experiences or believe that love can overcome financial challenges. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is based on wanting to provide for the child and avoid long-term issues. Financial stability isn't the only factor, but it's definitely a valid one. The key here is that the author isn't dismissing other factors like love or readiness, but they're emphasizing financial preparedness. Their girlfriend agrees, which shows they're on the same page. \n\nThe friends and parents might be coming from a place of personal experience where they didn't have much money but still raised their kids well. But that doesn't negate the fact that financial resources can help in various ways\u2014healthcare, education, stability, etc. The author isn't wrong to think that planning financially is important. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a pragmatic decision, which is a responsible approach to parenthood. The friends and parents might be oversimplifying the issue by saying money has nothing to do with it. While money isn't everything, it's a significant factor in providing a better environment for the child. The author's stance is reasonable and not being an asshole for it.\n"
