I told them this was not true and that I want to plan having a kid once I'm finicially stable so I can provide the child, my girlfriend agrees. We then discussed how much more expensive it is for the costs of living, and that having a child when you cant support them finicially ot can cause long lasting issues with the child. Am I the asshole for thinking the statement \"money has nothing to do with raising a kid\" is bullshit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they argue that money does matter when deciding to have a child. Their parents and friends say money isn't important, but the author and their girlfriend think financial stability is key.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's main point is that being financially stable allows them to provide for the child, which can prevent long-term issues. Their friends and family dismiss the role of money, but the author disagrees. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for thinking money matters. From a general perspective, while it's true that love and care are crucial, financial aspects do play a significant role in a child's well-being. The cost of raising a child is high, including education, healthcare, and basic needs. Being financially stable can reduce stress and provide a more secure environment. \n\nBut some might argue that it's possible to raise a child without a lot of money by being resourceful. However, the author isn't saying money is the only factor, just that it's important. Their reasoning seems logical because financial instability can lead to challenges that might affect the child's quality of life. \n\nThe friends and family might be focusing on the emotional aspects, but dismissing financial planning entirely could be seen as naive. The author's stance is practical, aiming to plan responsibly. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're prioritizing stability, which is a reasonable approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
