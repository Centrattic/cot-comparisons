He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author made it clear it's not sexual. The dad got angry when the author asked him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even if it's not sexual, someone has the right to set boundaries. The dad's actions involve physical contact without consent once the child is old enough to ask. The author is asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is a key point here. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which is concerning. He's using his parental role as justification, but that doesn't mean he can override his child's wishes. \n\nIn many societies, respect for personal space and consent is important regardless of family relationships. The author isn't doing anything wrong by asking to be left alone. The dad's reaction shows he's not respecting the boundary, which might indicate emotional immaturity, as mentioned. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on this reasoning, the author is right to set that boundary. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
