He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 13-year-old (13M) who is upset that their dad has been slapping their ass periodically since they were a kid. The dad argues that since he made them, he has the right to do it. The son tells him to stop, and the dad responds angrily, saying he'll touch when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person involved. The author is 13, which is a minor. Even though they might feel like they have the right to set boundaries, the legal perspective here might be different. In many places, children can express their preferences, but the parent's authority is significant. However, there's also a legal aspect regarding physical contact between parents and children. What might be seen as playful by some could be considered inappropriate, especially depending on cultural norms and specific laws.\n\nThe dad's justification is that he \"made\" them, which is a common argument but not legally valid. Parents have certain rights, but those don't extend to physical contact that the child finds unwelcome. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the issue is about the child's consent and comfort. At 13, the child might not have full legal standing to enforce this, but they can express their feelings. However, the dad's response\u2014threatening to not talk or touch the child\u2014is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the child's boundaries and could be part of a pattern of controlling behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a rights-based perspective, the author is expressing their discomfort and asking the dad to stop, which is their right. The dad's actions and response are problematic. However, considering the parent-child dynamic, the parent might have more authority in the household, but that doesn't mean they have the right to disregard the child's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is overstepping and reacting poorly. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to ask for the behavior to stop, especially if it's making them uncomfortable. The dad's behavior is inappropriate regardless of his intentions.\n"
