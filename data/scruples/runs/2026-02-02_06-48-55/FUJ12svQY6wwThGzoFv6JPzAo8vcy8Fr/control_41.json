He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and now the son is 13M. The dad got angry when told to stop, saying he made him so he can do it, and ended up threatening to stop talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and the father's response. Even in a parent-child relationship, physical touch should be consensual. The son is clearly telling his dad he doesn't like it now, which is his right. The dad's response is hostile, using threats and dismissing the son's boundaries. \n\nThe father's argument that he \"made him\" is not a valid reason to disregard personal boundaries. The son has the right to set limits on physical contact. The dad's reaction is inappropriate and could be considered abusive. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
