He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and they mention it's not sexual, just that the dad is emotionally a baby. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad got angry, saying he made them so he has the right. Then he said he wouldn't talk or touch them anymore, ending with \"I'll touch you when I want.\"\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me think.\n\nIn terms of consent and personal boundaries, adults have the right to set limits. Even in family settings, respecting someone's wishes about their body is important. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold weight legally or ethically. Parents can't override their adult children's boundaries just because they're parents. The author is an adult now (13M implies 13 months old, but that might be a typo; maybe 13 years? Wait, no, 13M usually refers to months, but the situation seems like an adult child. Maybe the user meant 13 years old? But the dad's behavior continuing into adulthood. Wait, maybe the user is actually an adult, and the dad is an older parent. The original post says \"my [13M] dad\" which might be a typo. Wait, in the original question, the user wrote \"my[13M] dad\". Maybe 13M is a typo for 13-year-old? Or maybe 13M is their age? Wait, the user is an adult, the dad is slapping their ass. The dad is an adult, and the user is asking if they are in the wrong for not wanting that.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is setting a boundary, the dad is violating it. The dad's response is to threaten withdrawing affection or contact. The author is asking if they are wrong for not wanting the slaps.\n\nThe legal aspect: In many places, parents can't physically touch their adult children in a way that's non-consensual without consequences. But even beyond legal, it's about respect for boundaries. The dad is an adult and should respect the author's wishes. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, especially given the threat to stop interacting. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
