He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with anger, saying he made them so he has the right, and that he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that the dad isn't acting in a sexual way, just that he's emotionally a baby. The key here is about personal boundaries and consent. Even within families, physical contact without consent can be an issue. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is important. The dad's response seems controlling and dismissive of the child's feelings. \n\nIn many places, parents do have some rights and responsibilities towards their children, but that doesn't include the right to physical contact that's unwanted. Once a child is an adult (assuming the user is 18+), their autonomy is their own. The dad's behavior might be seen as overstepping, especially after being told to stop. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's refusing to respect the child's wishes and using threats to maintain control. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
