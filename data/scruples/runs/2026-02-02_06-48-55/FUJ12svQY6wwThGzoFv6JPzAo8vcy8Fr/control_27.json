He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad hasn't done anything sexual and is emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even in a parent-child relationship, physical touch without consent can be problematic. The dad's argument that he \"made\" the author is a form of emotional manipulation and doesn't justify the action. \n\nThe author is asserting their right to set boundaries, which is important for healthy relationships. The dad's response of threatening to not interact or talk to the author is abusive behavior. The legal aspect might vary by location, but generally, children have the right to consent to physical contact as they grow older. The dad's actions, while maybe intended as playful in the past, are now being rejected, and the author is within their rights to stop it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary, which is a healthy thing, even if it causes conflict. The dad's response is what's inappropriate here.\n"
