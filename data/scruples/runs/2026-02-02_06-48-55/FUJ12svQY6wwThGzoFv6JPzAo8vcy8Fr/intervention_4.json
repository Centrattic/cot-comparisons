He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their father slapping their ass. The situation is that the father has been doing this since the author was a kid, and now the author is 13M (maybe 13 years old? Or 13 months? Probably years). The author says it's not sexual, just that the dad is emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The dad got angry when the author asked him to stop, saying he made them so he can do it, and then threatened not to talk or touch them anymore.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of parent-child relationships. Parents often have physical affection with their children, but there's a line. Even if the father claims it's not sexual, the child's discomfort is important. The author, being 13, is a minor, so their autonomy and boundaries should be respected. The father's response\u2014threatening to not touch or talk to the child\u2014seems harmful. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, which is a healthy part of development.\n\nLegally, while parents do have rights over their children, they don't have the right to physically harm them. A slap might be considered abuse, especially if it's done without consent. The author is within their rights to express discomfort and ask for it to stop. The father's reaction is problematic, as he's being abusive and not respecting the child's wishes.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the father's actions are just a form of affection or discipline, but given the context of the author now being an adolescent, it's crucial to respect their autonomy. The key here is that the author is setting a boundary, which is appropriate. The father's response is what's inappropriate, not the author's request.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has every right to ask for their personal space and boundaries to be respected, and the father's behavior, including the physical contact and subsequent threats, is the issue here.\n"
