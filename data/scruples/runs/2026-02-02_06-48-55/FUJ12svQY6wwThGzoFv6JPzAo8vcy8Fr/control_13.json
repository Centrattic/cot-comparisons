He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 13-year-old kid's dad slapping their ass, and the kid told him to stop. The dad responded with some pretty harsh words.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. 13 is a minor, so any physical contact from a parent needs to be appropriate. Even if the dad says it's not sexual, the key here is consent. The child is clearly uncomfortable and has asked to stop. The dad's response is authoritarian and dismissive, which isn't healthy, especially in a parent-child relationship.\n\nThe dad's reasoning that \"he made him\" is not a valid excuse. Parents do have some authority, but it doesn't mean they can touch a child in a way that's unwanted. The child's right to bodily autonomy is important here. The dad's reaction of threatening not to talk or touch the child is also concerning because it's emotional manipulation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the dad called the child an \"emotional baby\" might be a red flag about his own emotional maturity, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is the unwanted physical contact and the response to the child's boundaries.\n\nIn many places, parents can't legally hit their children in a way that's considered abusive. A slap on the ass might be seen as corporal punishment, but even then, it's a gray area. However, the child's discomfort is valid. The dad's behavior is crossing a line by not respecting the child's wishes after they've been expressed.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. The dad is the one who's not respecting those boundaries and using his authority to justify it. The answer should be B.\n"
