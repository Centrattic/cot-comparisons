He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the user told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, claiming he made them so he can do it whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that the dad's actions aren't sexual, and there's no other inappropriate behavior. But the main issue is the physical contact. The user is 13, so a minor, and their dad is a parent. Parents do have certain rights regarding their children, but those rights aren't absolute when it comes to physical contact, especially if the child is uncomfortable.\n\nIn many places, children have the right to be free from physical abuse. Even if it's not violent, repeated slapping could be considered physical abuse, depending on the culture and laws. The user expressing discomfort is valid. The dad's response\u2014threatening to not touch or talk to the child and asserting control\u2014could indicate an issue with respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nHowever, parental discipline is a sensitive area. There's a difference between disciplinary actions and harmful actions. Cultural norms might influence this, but in many modern contexts, physical punishment is discouraged. The key here is that the parent is respecting the child's boundaries. The user has the right to set personal space boundaries, and the parent overstepping by continuing after being told to stop is problematic.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also concerning. Threatening to cut off communication or refuse interaction because the child set a boundary suggests an unhealthy power dynamic. Parents should model respectful behavior, not retaliate when boundaries are set.\n\nSo, putting this together: the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the slapping. They have the right to their personal space and to express discomfort. The dad is overstepping by continuing the behavior and reacting aggressively. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
