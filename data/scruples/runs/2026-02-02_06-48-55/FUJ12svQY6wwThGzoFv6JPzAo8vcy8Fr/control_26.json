He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass periodically, and when the kid tells him to stop, the dad gets angry and says he made them so he can do it. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for wanting to stop this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad has been doing this since the kid was little, and the author clarifies it's not sexual. The dad's response is threatening to not talk or touch them, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and healthy parent-child dynamics.\n\nEven if the touching isn't sexual, the fact that the child is uncomfortable and asks for it to stop is crucial. Parents have a responsibility to respect their child's boundaries. The dad's reaction of using his authority (\"he made me\") and threatening to cut off contact if the child doesn't comply is problematic. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and the parent's behavior here is dismissive of the child's feelings.\n\nIn terms of the law, depending on the country, physical contact from a parent could be considered child abuse if the child objects. But even beyond legal aspects, emotionally, the parent is not setting a good example. The child is asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is something that should be supported. The dad's response of withdrawing affection as punishment is a form of emotional abuse.\n\nThe author is standing up for themselves, which is a positive action. They are within their rights to express discomfort and request that the behavior stops. The parent's reaction is in the wrong here, not the child's for speaking up. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
