He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that their dad has been periodically slapping their ass since they were a kid, and they asked him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they're 13, so they're a minor. The dad is their parent, and he's been doing this for years. The key points here are consent and personal boundaries. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual and just a form of affection or discipline, the child has the right to set boundaries. \n\nIn most legal systems, parents do have some authority over their children, but physical contact must be consensual. Since the child is expressing discomfort and asking to stop, the parent's continued insistence on touching them without consent could be problematic. The parent's reaction\u2014threatening not to touch or talk to the child\u2014might indicate emotional manipulation or a lack of respect for the child's feelings.\n\nAlso, considering the parent's emotional maturity being described as a \"baby,\" this might contribute to why he's not respecting the boundary. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their personal space. Parents should listen to their children's boundaries, even if they're used to a certain dynamic. The dad's response suggests he's not taking the child's feelings seriously, which is on him, not the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for asking their dad to stop.\n"
