He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has been slapping the author's ass since childhood, and the author finally told him to stop. The father responded angrily, saying he made him so he has the right, and then said he wouldn't talk or touch the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father claims there's no sexual intent here, just a habit from when the author was a kid. The author is 13, which is a minor, but the question is about consent and boundaries. Even if it's not sexual, does the father have the right to touch his child in a way the child now finds uncomfortable?\n\nIn most cases, parents have the authority to discipline or guide their children, but that doesn't extend to non-consensual touching, especially when the child is old enough to express discomfort. The father's response is also problematic because he's threatening to cut off communication, which is emotional manipulation. The author is asserting their personal space, which is a normal and healthy thing to do. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal boundaries. The father's actions, even if well-intentioned in the past, are now unwanted. The author is correct in stating their preference. The father's reaction is inappropriate because he's not respecting the child's wishes. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to set boundaries about their body, regardless of the parent's reasoning. The father's behavior is the issue here, not the author's request to stop the slapping.\n"
