He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me start by understanding the scenario. The dad has been doing this for years, the author says it's not sexual, and the dad hasn't done anything else. The dad responds negatively when the author asks him to stop, getting angry and threatening to not talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author is clearly expressing a discomfort that they had before, so asserting their boundaries here is important. Even if the dad has done this for a long time, the author has the right to say no. The dad's response is problematic because he's using his parental role as a justification, which is a common issue in boundary setting. Parents sometimes think they have the right to touch their children in certain ways because they raised them, but that's not a valid excuse if the child is an adult now. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 months? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 13M might be 13 months? Or maybe 13 years old? Wait, the user mentions \"my[13M]\" which is probably 13 months old? But if they're an adult now, maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's 13 years. But the key point is the author is an adult now, so the dad's actions are inappropriate. The author is asserting their right to personal space, which is completely valid. The dad's reaction is aggressive and controlling. So, the author is not in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B, No.\n"
