He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's 13-year-old son (13M) not wanting their father to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and he claims he made them so he can do it. The son told him to stop, and the dad got angry, saying he'll only touch or talk to him when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the son) is in the wrong. The question is whether the son is right to ask his dad to stop. Let's break it down.\n\nThe son is 13, so a minor. The dad is an adult. The slap on the ass is a physical touch. The dad claims it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior mentioned. The dad's reasoning is that he \"made\" him, implying parental rights. The son is asserting boundaries by saying he doesn't like it and wants it to stop.\n\nIn terms of rights, every person has the right to bodily autonomy. Even in a family context, parents should respect their children's boundaries. The dad's response is aggressive and controlling, which is problematic. The son is within his rights to ask for the behavior to stop. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening to not talk or touch him unless he complies\u2014is manipulative and shouldn't be tolerated.\n\nLegally, parents can't force physical contact on their children without consent. Even if it's a cultural or traditional practice, the child's comfort and consent matter. The fact that the dad is emotionally immature doesn't justify the behavior. The son is standing up for himself, which is appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. The dad is the one overstepping by not respecting the son's boundaries and reacting with threats.\n"
