He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and now won't talk or touch them. The user wants to know if the author is in the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The dad's actions are physical contact\u2014slapping the author's ass. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 years old. Wait, no, the user wrote [13M], maybe that's a typo. Maybe it's 13 months? That would be a baby, but the context talks about being a kid. Hmm. Wait, maybe [13M] is like 13 years old, male. Maybe the user is a 13-year-old male. But that's a minor. If the dad is slapping a minor's ass, that's a different scenario. But the user says it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. However, any physical contact with a minor by a parent can be a sensitive issue.\n\nBut the user is the one asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting the dad to do it. The dad is an adult, and the user is the child. Wait, maybe the user is an adult and their dad is slapping them. Wait, the age part is confusing. If the user is 13M, maybe it's 13 months, but that's a baby. But the dad has been doing this since they were a kid. Maybe the user is an adult now and their dad still slaps them. Wait, the user is the one who says \"my [13M] dad\"\u2014maybe that's a typo. Maybe it's \"my dad is 13M\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the user is 13 years old and male. So the dad is slapping the 13-year-old's ass. The user is telling the dad to stop, and the dad is upset.\n\nIn that case, the parent's behavior is inappropriate. Even if not sexual, physical contact like that between a parent and child, especially a minor, can be considered abusive or at least overstepping. The parent's response is also problematic, threatening to stop touching or talking to the child, which is emotional manipulation. The user has the right to set boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to ask the dad to stop. The dad's actions are wrong, not the author's.\n"
