He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad's response was to say he made them so he has the right and then to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even in family, consent matters. The author is an adult (13M means 13 months as an adult?), so their autonomy should be respected. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold because that's not a valid reason for physical contact without consent. The dad's reaction is controlling and abusive, which is a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are the author asserting their rights and the dad's response being hostile. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is the one acting inappropriately by not respecting that boundary. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
