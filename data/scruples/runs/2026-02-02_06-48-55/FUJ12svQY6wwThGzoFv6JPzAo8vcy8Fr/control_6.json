He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The father has been doing this since the person was a child, and the father claims he made them, so he has the right to touch them. The person told the father to stop, and the father responded angrily, threatening to not touch or talk to them and saying he can touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical contact should be consensual. The father's actions, while perhaps not intended as sexual, are a form of physical contact that the child does not want. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, which is a healthy and normal part of developing autonomy.\n\nThe father's response is problematic. He's using his position of authority (\"he made me\") to justify non-consensual touch, which is a form of emotional manipulation. Saying things like \"I'll touch you when I want\" is a refusal to respect the child's boundaries, which is not acceptable. The father's reaction\u2014threatening to cut off contact\u2014is also manipulative and harmful.\n\nLegally, while parents do have certain rights regarding their children, those rights do not extend to non-consensual physical contact when the child is an adult. The child has the right to bodily autonomy. The father's actions could be considered assault if there's no consent, but that might depend on local laws. However, the ethical standpoint here is clear: respecting personal boundaries is crucial.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is no because the author is setting a boundary they have every right to set. The father is the one overstepping and refusing to respect those boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
