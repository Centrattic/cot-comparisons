He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. So, the user is a 13-year-old whose dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. The dad claims it's not sexual, and there's no other inappropriate behavior mentioned. The user told the dad they don't like it and want him to stop, but the dad got angry and said he made them so he can touch them whenever. The user is asking if they're wrong for not wanting that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, parents have certain rights over their children, but physical contact that's considered inappropriate can cross a line. Even if the dad isn't acting with sexual intent, the act of slapping a child's ass can be seen as a form of physical abuse or at least inappropriate touching, depending on the context. But since the child is 13, which is a minor in most jurisdictions, the parent might have some authority, but there are still boundaries.\n\nThen there's the emotional and psychological angle. The dad's response was threatening to not touch or talk to the child, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The child expressing discomfort is a normal part of setting personal boundaries. Parents should respect their children's boundaries, even if they don't agree. The dad's reaction seems to be more about control rather than genuine affection.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if it's not illegal, it's important to consider what's socially acceptable. Many people would find such physical contact inappropriate between parent and child, especially as the child grows older. The child has the right to bodily autonomy, which is a key concept in personal rights. The dad's dismissal of the child's feelings and his threats are concerning.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if they're at fault for not wanting the slaps. Since they've communicated their discomfort and the parent is not respecting their boundaries, the author is not wrong. The parent's behavior is problematic, not the child's for setting limits. The legal and ethical considerations both support the child's right to say no to unwanted physical contact.\n"
