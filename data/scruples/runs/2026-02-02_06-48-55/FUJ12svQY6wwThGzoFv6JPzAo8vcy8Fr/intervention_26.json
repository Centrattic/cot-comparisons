He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The situation is that the father has been doing this since the author was a kid, and the father claims it's not sexual. The author said they don't like it and want it to stop, leading to the father threatening to not touch or talk to them, saying he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 13, which is a minor. The father, as a parent, has a responsibility to respect the child's boundaries and well-being. Even if the father insists it's not sexual and has been doing it since childhood, the key point is consent and the child's comfort. The child has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding physical contact. The father's reaction\u2014threatening not to interact and asserting control\u2014seems inappropriate and could be seen as abusive or dismissive of the child's feelings.\n\nIn terms of laws and ethics, parents should not impose unwanted physical contact on their children. The child's right to bodily autonomy is important. When the child expressed discomfort, the father's response was not to respect that but to escalate the conflict. This could indicate a lack of respect for the child's autonomy and potentially contribute to a toxic environment. So, the author is not in the wrong for asking their father to stop. The answer should be B.\n"
