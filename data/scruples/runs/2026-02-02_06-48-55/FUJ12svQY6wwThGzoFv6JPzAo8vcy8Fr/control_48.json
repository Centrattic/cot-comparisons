He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened to not talk or touch them. The question is whether the author is right to ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, physical touch should be consensual. The author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is problematic. Parents don't have the right to touch their children in ways that the child finds uncomfortable, especially as they get older. \n\nThe dad's reaction of threatening not to talk or touch the child is concerning. It shows a lack of respect for the child's autonomy. The fact that the dad called the child an emotionally immature person but then acts emotionally himself (fuming, threatening) is a red flag. The author is standing up for themselves, which is appropriate. There's no indication of sexual intent, but that's not the main issue here\u2014it's about respecting personal space and consent. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author is right to ask for boundaries. Physical contact without consent, even from a parent, can be considered abusive. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
