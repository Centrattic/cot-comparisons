He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made the author so he has the right. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The dad's actions are physical contact, specifically slapping the ass. The user clarifies it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. But the key point is consent and boundaries. \n\nEven if the dad is emotionally immature, the author has the right to set personal boundaries. The dad's response of threatening to not touch or talk to the author is manipulative. The author is an adult now (13 months old? Wait, wait, the original post says [13M], which probably means 13 years old. So if the user is 13, their dad is their parent. But the dad's behavior is crossing a line by not respecting the kid's boundaries. \n\nThe dad's argument that he \"made\" the author so he can do it is invalid. Parents don't have the right to touch their children in ways that the child finds uncomfortable, especially when the child is in their teens and capable of expressing their feelings. The author is within their rights to ask for personal space. The dad's reaction is inappropriate and controlling. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set boundaries. The dad is the one acting inappropriately here. Even if there's no sexual intent, respecting the child's comfort is essential. The author is justified in wanting to stop the behavior.\n"
