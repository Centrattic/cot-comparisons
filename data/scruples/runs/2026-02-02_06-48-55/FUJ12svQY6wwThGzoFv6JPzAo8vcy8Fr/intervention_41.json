He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid and claims he made them so he can do it. The author told him to stop, and the dad got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. The author is an adult now, 13 months old? Wait, no, the age mentioned is [13M], which probably means 13 months as a kid, but the author is an adult now. The key here is that the author is an adult setting boundaries with their parent. \n\nPhysical touch from a parent, even if it's non-sexual, can be a boundary issue when the adult child doesn't want it. The dad's response of not touching or talking to them is a form of punishment, which is a problem. The author has the right to their body and to set personal boundaries. The dad's argument that he made them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to say no. The dad's actions are disrespectful of the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
