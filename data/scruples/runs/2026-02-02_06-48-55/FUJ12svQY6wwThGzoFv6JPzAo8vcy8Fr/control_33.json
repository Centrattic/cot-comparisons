He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has been slapping his adult son's ass since he was a kid. The son tells his dad to stop, but the dad responds aggressively, saying he made him so he can do it whenever.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of both individuals. The dad is a parent, but the son is an adult. Physical boundaries are important, even in parent-child relationships. The father's actions might have been playful or a form of affection in the past, but the son now feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal boundaries. The father's argument that he has the right because he's the parent doesn't hold weight once the child is an adult. Parents don't have the right to touch their adult children in any way that the adult doesn't consent to. The son is asserting his right to set boundaries, which is perfectly valid. \n\nThe dad's reaction\u2014threatening not to touch or talk to the son\u2014is also problematic. It's a form of emotional manipulation. The son isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself. Even if the father's intentions were non-sexual, the son's discomfort matters. \n\nLegally and ethically, adults have the right to their own body and to say no to unwanted physical contact. The father's behavior is overstepping, and the son is justified in asking him to stop. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
