He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is a 13-year-old male whose dad has been slapping his ass since he was a kid. The dad claims it's not sexual, and the author acknowledges that. The dad is emotionally immature but not a pedophile. The situation escalated when the author told his dad he didn't like it and wanted him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made him so he has the right, and then said he wouldn't touch or talk to the author, ending with a threat to touch him when he wants. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting his dad to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. 13 years old is still a minor, and while the dad claims it's not sexual, the physical contact is unwelcome. The author has a right to set boundaries, even with family members. The dad's response is concerning because he's refusing to respect the child's wishes and making threats. The key here is consent and respect for personal boundaries. Even if the dad's intention isn't sexual, the action is unwelcome, and the author is correct to express that. The dad's reaction could be a sign of poor emotional regulation or a lack of understanding of personal space. The author isn't wrong for standing up for himself. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
