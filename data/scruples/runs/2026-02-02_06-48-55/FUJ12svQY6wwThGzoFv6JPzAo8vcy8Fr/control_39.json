He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made them so he has the right, and then stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the dad is emotionally immature but not sexually motivated. The key issue here is consent and personal boundaries. Even in a family setting, everyone has the right to their own body and to set boundaries. The dad's actions, while maybe not malicious, are physical contact that the author is now uncomfortable with. \n\nWhen the author asked to stop, the dad's response was dismissive and even aggressive, which is not okay. The fact that the author is asserting their boundaries is a positive step. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't justify the physical contact. Parents have the responsibility to respect their children's growing autonomy and boundaries as they age. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask for their boundaries to be respected. The dad's reaction is problematic, but that doesn't make the author at fault for standing up for themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
