He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can touch them. The author is wondering if they're right to ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad claims it's not sexual and has no history of other inappropriate behavior. He's described as emotionally immature but not a pedophile. The key point here is bodily autonomy. The author is an adult now (13M, so 13 years old, but maybe the user is older? Wait, 13M might mean 13 months? No, probably 13 years old. Wait, the user is the one who is 13M? Or the kid? Wait, the original question says \"my[13M]\" which probably means their child is 13 months old. Hmm, maybe the user is a parent? Wait, no, the original scenario is that the person is the child. Let me check again.\n\nThe original post says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" So the person is the child of the dad. The person is an adult, maybe? Because they're talking about their dad's behavior towards them. The dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and the person is now telling the dad to stop. The dad is upset and threatening to not touch or talk to them.\n\nSo the user here is the adult child who is telling their dad to stop touching them in a way they're uncomfortable with. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for doing so. The user's reasoning is that they have the right to bodily autonomy, and the dad's response was inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering this, in terms of ethics and rights, an adult has the right to set boundaries about their body. Even if the touch was considered affectionate in the past, once the person expresses discomfort, the touch becomes non-consensual. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't override the person's right to say no. The dad's response of threatening to stop interacting is also a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that certain families have cultural or traditional ways of showing affection, but that doesn't make it acceptable if the person is now objecting. The key is consent and respect for boundaries. Once someone is an adult, any touch without consent is not acceptable, even from family members.\n\nSo in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad is in the wrong for not respecting the author's wishes and for reacting with hostility and threats. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
