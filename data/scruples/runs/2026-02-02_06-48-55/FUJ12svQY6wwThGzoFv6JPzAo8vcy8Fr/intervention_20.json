He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with some pretty strong words, saying he made them so he can do it and that he won't talk to them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that the dad isn't doing anything sexual, just slapping. The author is an adult now, 13M, which I assume is 13 months? Wait, no, 13M probably means 13 months old? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's 13 years old? Oh, the user wrote \"13M\" which might be a typo. Wait, the original question is from someone whose child is 13 months old? Wait, no, the author is the one being slapped by their dad. Wait, the parent is the one who slapped the author. Wait, the parent is the dad, so the author is an adult. Wait, the situation is confusing. Let me re-read.\n\nThe original situation: The author is an adult (assuming they're 13 months old? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe \"13M\" is a typo for 13 years old? Or maybe the parent is the one with a 13-month-old child? Wait, the title says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\" So maybe the author is the parent of a 13-month-old but their own dad (the author's father) is slapping them. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, maybe the user is a 13-month-old? No, that would be a baby, but the scenario is about a dad slapping the author's ass. So the author must be an adult. Therefore, maybe \"13M\" is a mistake. Maybe the user meant their child is 13 months old, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for 13 years old. Maybe the author is 13 years old? But the dad is slapping their ass as a kid and now they're adult. Wait, maybe \"13M\" is the user's child's age. But the question is about the user's own dad. Hmm. Maybe the user is an adult, and their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid. Now the user is telling the dad to stop. The dad responds by saying he made them, so he has the right, and threatens to not talk to them. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to stop the physical contact.\n\nSo the key points: The dad's behavior is physical contact (slapping the ass) that the author is now objecting to. The dad is using a parental authority argument (\"I made you, so I have the right\") and threatening to cut off contact. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults have the right to bodily autonomy. Even within families, non-consensual or unwanted physical contact is not acceptable. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is invalid in adult relationships. Once the child becomes an adult, the parent's authority doesn't override the adult child's right to consent to physical contact. So the author is correct in asserting their right to stop the contact. The dad's response is inappropriate and controlling. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
