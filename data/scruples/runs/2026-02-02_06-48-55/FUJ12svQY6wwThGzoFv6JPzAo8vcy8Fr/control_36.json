He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid. The author mentions that it's not sexual, and the dad hasn't done anything else inappropriate. But the key point here is that the author told the dad to stop, and the dad responded with something like \"I made you, so I have the right to do it\" and then said he wouldn't talk or touch them anymore. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for wanting to stop this behavior.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships, even within families, everyone has the right to set personal boundaries. Physical touch, even if it's from a family member, should be consensual. If someone is uncomfortable with a certain type of touch, they have the right to express that. The dad's response seems controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings. Saying \"I made you\" is a common excuse but doesn't justify non-consensual touch. The threat to stop interacting altogether is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nLegally, while parents have authority, they also have to respect their children's autonomy and personal space. The author is an adult now (since they're 13M, which might be a typo for 23 or another age, but the key is they're old enough to set boundaries). The dad's behavior is crossing a boundary, and the author is justified in wanting to stop it. The dad's reaction is not acceptable either.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad's actions are the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
