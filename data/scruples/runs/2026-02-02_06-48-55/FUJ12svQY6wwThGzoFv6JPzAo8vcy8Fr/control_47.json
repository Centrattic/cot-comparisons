He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass, and the kid tells the dad to stop. The dad responds angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatens not to talk or touch them. The question is whether the author (the kid) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad says it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior. But the kid is uncomfortable and asked him to stop. The dad's reaction is hostile, using threats and asserting control. \n\nIn terms of rights, a child has the right to bodily autonomy. Even within a family, no one should touch another person in a way that makes them uncomfortable without consent. The dad's actions are a violation of that autonomy, especially when the child objects. The dad's justification that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legally or ethically. Parents have the responsibility to respect their children's boundaries, and threatening to stop communication is not acceptable.\n\nIn many places, any non-consensual touching, even if not sexual, can be considered assault. However, since the user is 13, they might be in a situation where they can't legally take action on their own, but they do have the right to express discomfort. The dad's response is dismissive and abusive, which is a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
