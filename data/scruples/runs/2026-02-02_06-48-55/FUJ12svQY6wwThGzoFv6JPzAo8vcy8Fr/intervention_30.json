He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their dad slapping their ass. The author says the dad has done this since they were a kid, and it's not sexual. The dad gets angry when the author asks him to stop, making threats like not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even if the dad thinks it's okay because he's the parent, the child has the right to set personal boundaries. The author is 13, but the age might be a typo. Wait, the user mentions [13M] which could mean the author is 13 years old. Wait, no, the original post says \"My[13M] dad\"\u2014maybe that's a typo. Let me check the original text again.\n\nWait, the original question says \"AITA for not wanting my[13M] dad...\" Maybe that's a typo for \"my [13-year-old] dad\"? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's the author's age? Like, the author is 13, and their dad is slapping them. But 13 is a minor, so the parent's actions might be considered different. However, the parent's right to discipline is one thing, but physical contact beyond that could be an issue. But the author is an adult? Wait, the parent is slapping their own child. Wait, the original question says \"AITA for not wanting my [13M] dad to periodically slap my ass?\" Maybe [13M] is a typo for [13-year-old] and the author is the child? So the dad is slapping the author, who is 13. But then the author is a minor, so the parent's actions might be seen as part of discipline. But even then, there's a line between discipline and inappropriate touch. If the author is 13 and asking their dad to stop, the parent might be overstepping. However, if the parent is the legal guardian, there might be a different perspective. But the parent's response is aggressive, threatening to not talk to the child. That's a red flag. The key here is consent and the parent's right to touch. Even if the parent is the parent, the child can ask to stop, and the parent's threat to cut off communication is not healthy. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The parent's behavior is more problematic, both the physical contact and the response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
