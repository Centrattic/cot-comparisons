He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, claiming he made them so he can do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. But the key point is the author's right to set boundaries. Physical touch, even within family, should require consent. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is problematic. Parents can't force physical contact on their children, even if they're adults now.\n\nThe author is 13M, which I assume means 13 years old. Wait, no, maybe 13M as in 13 months? Wait, no, the user probably meant 13 years old. Wait, the original post says \"My[13M]\" which might be a typo. If the user is 13 years old, then their dad is slapping their ass. But then the user is 13, and the dad is acting like an emotional baby. The user told the dad to stop, and the dad got angry and said he wouldn't talk or touch them unless they comply.\n\nSo, the main issue is the dad's behavior. Even if it's not sexual, non-consensual physical contact is an issue. The author has the right to say no. The dad's response is controlling and abusive. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. So the answer should be B.\n"
