He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author, who is 13, is upset that their dad keeps slapping their ass. They mention that their dad says it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The dad's response was that since he made the child, he has the right, and then he threatens to not touch or talk to them if they ask him to stop. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their dad to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. The author is 13, so a minor. Parents have legal rights over their children, but that doesn't mean they can be abusive. Physical touch from a parent can be part of affection or discipline, but it's important that the child feels comfortable. The key here is consent and the child's boundaries.\n\nThe dad's argument that he \"made\" the child doesn't give him the right to touch them in a way the child finds uncomfortable. Even if the parent thinks it's harmless, the child's right to bodily autonomy is important. The father's reaction seems controlling and disrespectful. Threatening to not touch or talk to the child is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nIn terms of legality, depending on jurisdiction, even parents can be held accountable if their actions are considered abusive. However, the question is more about moral and ethical wrongdoing. The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to ask their parent to stop any unwanted physical contact. The parent's refusal and the threatening behavior are the issues here.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is valid regardless of the parent's justification. The parent's behavior crosses a line into emotional abuse with the threats.\n"
