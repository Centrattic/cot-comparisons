He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad says he made them, so he has the right. The author told him to stop, and the dad responded with anger, saying he'll touch when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even in family relationships, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author is an adult now (13M means 13 months, so the person is an adult), and they have the right to say no to any physical contact they're uncomfortable with. The dad's argument that he made them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents don't have the right to touch their adult children in ways the children find uncomfortable without consent.\n\nThe dad's response was inappropriate\u2014threatening not to touch or talk and being aggressive. The author standing up for themselves by asking to stop is valid. Physical contact should always be consensual. Even if there's a history of such behavior, changing boundaries as one grows older is normal. The dad needs to respect that change.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is overstepping and not respecting their wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
