He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the original question is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do that, and threatened not to talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a 13-year-old male, so a minor. The dad's behavior is physical contact with the child, even if the dad claims it's not sexual. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, while the dad is reacting violently and uncooperatively.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents do have some authority, but they also have a responsibility to respect their child's autonomy and well-being. Physical discipline, like slapping, can be a gray area. In many places, any form of corporal punishment is discouraged or even illegal. However, even if it's not illegal, it's about consent and the child's right to feel safe. The author is saying they don't like it and want it to stop, which is a valid boundary. The dad's response\u2014threatening to stop interaction and saying he can touch when he wants\u2014seems like a violation of the child's autonomy. \n\nEmotionally, the dad's reaction is concerning. Calling the child an emotionally baby shows he's not handling the situation maturely. The key here is the child's right to set limits. Even if the action (slapping) wasn't harmful in the past, the child now has the right to express discomfort. The dad's refusal to respect that and instead threatening to withdraw parental engagement is problematic. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, children have the right to be free from physical abuse or unwanted touch, even by parents. The dad's behavior could be considered abusive if it's causing distress. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop this. The dad is overstepping by continuing and reacting negatively to the child's boundary.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, and the dad's response is inappropriate.\n"
