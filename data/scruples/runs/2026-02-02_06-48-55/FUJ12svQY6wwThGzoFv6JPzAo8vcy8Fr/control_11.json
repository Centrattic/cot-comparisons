He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 13 years old and their dad has been slapping their ass periodically. The dad claims he made them so he has the right, and when the kid asked to stop, the dad got angry and said he wouldn't touch or talk to them. The key points here are the age of the kid and the nature of the touch. \n\nFirst, even if there's no sexual intent, a parent slapping a child's ass can be seen as inappropriate. Kids have the right to bodily autonomy. The dad's response is also concerning because he's using his parental authority to justify unwanted physical contact. Saying he made the child gives him the right is not a valid argument. The child expressing discomfort is a valid boundary. \n\nAlso, the dad's reaction\u2014threatening to cut off communication and refusing to respect the child's wishes\u2014is not healthy. Parents should respect their children's boundaries, especially regarding physical contact. The fact that the dad is emotionally immature adds another layer, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is overstepping, and the child's right to say no should be respected. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
