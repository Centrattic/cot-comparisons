He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad has been slapping the author's ass since they were a kid. The author says it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. The key points here are that the author is now 13, and they've told their dad they don't like it and want it to stop. The dad responded with some pretty strong words, saying he made them so he can do it, and that he'll touch them when he wants. The author is asking if they're in the right to want it to stop.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and physical boundaries. Even within a family, personal space and consent matter. The father's actions, while maybe not sexual, are still physical contact that the child is now objecting to. At 13, the author is old enough to express their discomfort and set boundaries. The father's response is concerning because he's using his parental role to justify unwanted touching, which isn't acceptable. \n\nThe father's statement that he made the author so he has the right to touch them is a red flag. Parents have responsibilities and rights, but they don't have the right to violate their child's personal boundaries without consent. The author's response is appropriate\u2014they have the right to feel uncomfortable and ask for the behavior to stop. The father's reaction of withdrawing affection or threatening not to talk to them is also a form of emotional manipulation, which isn't healthy.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to bodily autonomy. The father's actions might need to be addressed, possibly with the help of another trusted adult or family intervention, but the author's stance is valid. So, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
