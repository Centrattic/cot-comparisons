He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and the author told their dad to stop. The dad got angry, said he made them so he can do it, and threatened to not touch or talk to them. The author wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author is an adult now (13M, so 13 months since the post, but the original question is from someone who's an adult, probably in their early 20s if they were a kid earlier). The dad's behavior could be seen as inappropriate, even if it's not sexual. Physical contact between parents and adult children should respect the child's comfort. The author has the right to set boundaries, so telling their dad to stop is reasonable.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also important. He claimed ownership over the author (\"he made me\") and used threats. That's controlling behavior. The author isn't wrong for standing up to that. Even if the dad is emotionally immature, the author's right to their own body is clear. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
