He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the writer finally told him to stop. The dad responded with some aggressive comments about having the right to touch them because he made them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer mentions that the dad's actions are not sexual and that there's no history of pedophilia. However, even if the intention isn't sexual, physical contact without consent can be problematic. The key here is the consent aspect. The writer is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months old when the post was made, but the person is an adult in the situation), so they have the right to their own body. \n\nThe dad's response is concerning. Telling someone he won't talk to them or that he'll touch them when he wants crosses into emotional abuse territory. The writer standing up for their boundaries is appropriate. Even if the dad claims it's a long-standing habit, it's the adult child's right to set boundaries. The father's reaction seems more about control than any innocent affection. \n\nIn many cultures, physical affection between parents and adult children can vary, but it's important to respect the individual's comfort level. The fact that the writer felt comfortable stating their boundaries is a positive step. The dad's reaction suggests he's not respecting their autonomy, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer is not in the wrong. They're asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is a valid and important thing. The dad's behavior is what's inappropriate here.\n"
