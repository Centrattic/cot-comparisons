He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and the author clarifies it's not sexual. The dad's argument is that he made them, so he has the right. The author told him to stop, and the dad reacted with anger, threatening not to talk or touch them anymore. Now the author is wondering if their stance is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within family, physical touch should always be consensual. The dad's actions are non-consensual, right? The author has every right to set boundaries. The dad's response is also concerning because he's being aggressive and threatening, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe dad's reasoning that he made them so he can do it is flawed. Parental rights don't extend to non-consensual physical contact, especially if it's making the child uncomfortable. The fact that the dad is emotionally immature adds to the problem, making the dynamic more toxic.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's reaction shows a lack of respect for the author's wishes, which is a red flag for an unhealthy relationship. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
