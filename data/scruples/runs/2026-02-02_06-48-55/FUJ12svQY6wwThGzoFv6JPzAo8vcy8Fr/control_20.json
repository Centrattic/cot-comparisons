He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad does this periodically and says he made them so he can. The kid told him to stop, and the dad got angry and said he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad claims it's not sexual, and he's emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The kid is 13, so a minor. The dad's actions could be seen as physical contact that the child is uncomfortable with. Even if it's meant as playful or affectionate, the child has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe dad's response\u2014saying he made the child and thus has the right\u2014is problematic. Parents do have the right to discipline, but that's different from affection. Slapping the ass might be considered a form of physical affection, but if the child is uncomfortable, the parent should respect that. The dad's reaction of cutting off communication if the child doesn't comply is also concerning. It shows he's not respecting the child's boundaries and is being controlling.\n\nLegally, a parent has certain rights, but those are within limits. Physical touch from a parent can be acceptable in some contexts, but when the child objects, the parent should stop. The dad's refusal to stop and his hostile reaction suggest he's overstepping. The child is in the right to set personal boundaries, so the answer should be B.\n"
