He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their dad to slap their ass anymore. The dad says he made them so he has the right to do it and gets upset when the author asks him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and he's not a pedophile, just emotionally immature. The key point here is consent and personal boundaries. Even in family relationships, respecting someone's personal space and their wishes is important. The author is clearly stating their discomfort now, which is a valid right. The father's response is dismissive and even threatening, which is problematic. He's using his parental role as a justification, but that doesn't override the child's right to set boundaries as they grow older. The author is an adult now (since they're 13M, which I assume means 13 months, but wait, maybe that's a typo? Wait, the original post says \"13M\" but that's probably 13 months? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's 13 years old? Maybe the user meant 13 years old, and \"M\" is a typo. Let me check again. The original post says \"AITA for not wanting my [13M] dad...\" Hmm, maybe the user meant 13 years old, and \"M\" is a mistake. Otherwise, if it's 13 months, that's a baby, which doesn't make sense in the context of being able to walk to the kitchen and have this conversation. So probably a typo for 13 years old. So the author is a teenager now. Even at 13, setting personal boundaries is important. The father's response of saying he \"made\" them is not a valid reason to disregard their autonomy. The author is in their right to express discomfort and ask for the behavior to stop. The father's reaction is inappropriate, as he's using emotional manipulation and threats. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are about respecting personal boundaries, consent, and the parent's responsibility to adjust to the child's needs as they grow.\n"
