He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass periodically, and the kid tells the dad to stop. The dad responds with some strong language and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 13, they're a minor, and any physical contact that's unwanted from a parent could be an issue. Even if the dad says it's not sexual, the key point here is consent. The child is clearly uncomfortable and has asked to stop, which the dad ignores. \n\nThe dad's response is pretty aggressive: saying he made the child so he has the right, and then refusing to talk or touch them unless he wants to. That's not healthy. Parents have a duty to respect their child's boundaries, especially when it comes to physical contact. \n\nEven if the dad isn't being sexual, the fact that the child feels violated and the dad is dismissing their feelings is problematic. The law usually sides with the child in these cases, as minors can't consent to certain types of physical contact, especially if it's causing distress. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. The dad's behavior is inappropriate and needs to stop. The answer should be B.\n"
