He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author is a 13-year-old male who says their dad has been slapping their ass periodically since they were a kid. The dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else, and the dad is described as emotionally a baby but not a pedophile.\n\nThe key event is that the author told the dad they didn't like it and wanted him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made the author so he has the right to do it, then got angry, said he wouldn't touch or talk to the author, and that he'll touch when he wants. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting this.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and I have to choose between A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking others' opinions.\n\nFirst, let me break down the elements. The dad is a parent, so there's a power dynamic here. The child is 13, which is a minor. The father's actions involve physical contact that the child is now objecting to. The father's response is aggressive, asserting his right to touch the child, and threatening to cut off contact if the child doesn't comply. \n\nThe author is clearly expressing discomfort and setting a boundary. The dad's response is dismissive and authoritarian. The child is within their rights to set boundaries, especially when it comes to personal space and physical contact. Even if the father has done it since the child was young, the child's consent isn't implied just because it's been done before. The child is now clearly stating they don't want it, so the father should respect that. \n\nThe father's argument that he \"made\" the author doesn't give him the right to touch them in a way they find uncomfortable. Parents have the right to guide their children, but they don't have the right to violate their child's personal space without consent. The threat to stop talking or touching is emotional manipulation, which is inappropriate. \n\nThe author is standing up for themselves, which is a healthy boundary. Even if the father isn't being sexual, the child's right to say no is valid. The father's behavior is controlling and doesn't respect the child's autonomy. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask for the behavior to stop. The father is the one overstepping and being disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
