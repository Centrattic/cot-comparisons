He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the kid just told him to stop. The dad's response was that he made them so he has the right, and then said he wouldn't touch or talk to them anymore. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad says it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The kid is 13M, so a minor. The dad is acting out of a sense of authority, maybe, thinking that as a parent he can do whatever he wants. But the kid is setting a boundary, which is their right. \n\nPhysical touch between parents and children should be respecting the child's boundaries. Even if it's not sexual, it's about consent. The kid has the right to say no to unwanted touch. The dad's reaction is also problematic because he's refusing to communicate and using a threat to withhold interaction. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, parents do have some authority, but that doesn't override the child's right to bodily autonomy. The kid standing up for themselves is appropriate. The dad's response is controlling and could be signs of emotional abuse. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to ask for the slapping to stop and to express discomfort with their father's behavior. The dad's justification is invalid, and the child's boundaries should be respected.\n"
