He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad claims he made them so he has the right to do it. The author told their dad to stop, and the dad responded angrily, saying he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and he insists it's not sexual. The key points here are consent and boundaries. Even in parent-child relationships, consent matters. The author is an adult here (13M years old?), so they have the right to set personal boundaries. The dad's actions, regardless of intent, are violating the author's personal space. \n\nThe dad's response is also problematic. He's using his parental authority to justify physical contact without consent, which isn't acceptable. Even if the dad is acting out of a sense of closeness or tradition, the author has every right to say no. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening not to talk or touch them\u2014is controlling and abusive. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
