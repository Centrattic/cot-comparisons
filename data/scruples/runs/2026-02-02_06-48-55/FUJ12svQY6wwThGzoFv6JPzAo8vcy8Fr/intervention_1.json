He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and he claims he made them so he has the right. The author told him to stop, and the dad responded angrily, saying he'll touch when he wants.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult now because they mention their child (13M), so they're at least in their 20s or 30s. Even if the dad's intentions aren't sexual, the action of slapping someone's ass without consent can be considered a boundary issue. The author has every right to set personal boundaries. The dad's response\u2014threatening not to touch or talk to them\u2014isn't appropriate either. He's using his parental role to justify behavior that's disrespectful and possibly abusive.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author is asserting their right to control their own body, which is valid. The dad's reaction is controlling and dismissive of the author's feelings. Even though the dad might not have malicious intent, the behavior is still problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
