He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 13-year-old's dad slapping their ass, and the kid told the dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it, and threatened not to talk to them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dad has been doing this since the kid was a kid, and the poster clarifies it's not sexual. But the kid is now 13 and told their dad they don't like it. The dad's reaction is defensive and aggressive.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the kid) is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no (not wrong).\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, bodily autonomy is important. The kid has the right to say no to unwanted touch, even from a parent. The dad's behavior might be seen as inappropriate because the child's consent is necessary, and the dad is overstepping. The dad's response is also concerning because he's asserting control through threats.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the dad's actions are traditional or a sign of affection. But given the child's age and the clear discomfort, the dad should respect the child's boundaries. The kid acting to set those boundaries is actually the right thing to do. The dad's justification (\"he made him\") is a red flag for controlling behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set personal boundaries, and the dad's reaction is the problematic part.\n"
