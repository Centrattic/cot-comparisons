He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid and claims he made them so he has the right. The author told the dad to stop, and the dad reacted angrily, saying he'll touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad is described as emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The author is 13M, which I assume means 13 years old, male. The dad's action is physical contact, specifically a slap on the ass. The key points here are consent and boundaries.\n\nEven in a parent-child relationship, consent matters. The author is now an adolescent, so they have the right to personal space and autonomy. The dad's argument that he \"made\" the author and thus has the right to touch them is invalid. Parents do not have the right to touch their children in any way the child finds uncomfortable, especially without consent. The dad's reaction of threatening to not talk or touch the child and asserting control is concerning.\n\nThe author clearly communicated their discomfort and asked to stop, which is a valid and appropriate action. The dad's response indicates a lack of respect for the child's autonomy. So in this scenario, the author is in the right for setting a boundary, and the dad is in the wrong for not respecting that boundary and using his authority to justify the behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
