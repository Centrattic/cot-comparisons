He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about the author, a 13-year-old, who is upset because their dad has been slapping their ass periodically. The dad claims he has the right because he \"made\" the author and threatens to stop touching or talking to them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting this.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the dad's actions and the author's response. The dad's behavior is physical contact that the author finds uncomfortable. Even if the dad insists it's not sexual, it's still about consent. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their body. The dad's response is threatening and dismissive, which is concerning. The author standing up for themselves by expressing discomfort is justified. The dad's claim of authority isn't valid in terms of bodily autonomy. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're asserting their personal boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
