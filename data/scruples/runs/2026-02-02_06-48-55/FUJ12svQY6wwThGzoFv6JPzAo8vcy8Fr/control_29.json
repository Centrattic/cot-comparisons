He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad started doing this since they were a kid, and the author says it's not sexual, just emotionally a baby. The dad got upset when the author asked him to stop and said things like \"I made you so I can touch you.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. Even if it started when the author was a child, now they're an adult. Parents can set boundaries, and children can too. The key here is consent. The author is clearly uncomfortable and asked the dad to stop. The dad's response is dismissive and aggressive, which is problematic.\n\nThe dad's argument that he made them so he can touch them isn't valid. Just because someone is a parent doesn't mean they have the right to touch their adult child in a way the child finds uncomfortable. The author has the right to their own body and to set limits on physical contact.\n\nAlso, the dad's reaction\u2014threatening to not talk to them and being confrontational\u2014shows a lack of respect for the child's boundaries. Emotional abuse might be in play here with the dad being an \"emotional baby\" as the author mentioned.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to ask for the slap to stop, and the dad is overstepping by not respecting that. The answer should be B.\n"
