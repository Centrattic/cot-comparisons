He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their father to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with some pretty strong words about not talking or touching them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even if the father thinks it's a harmless gesture, the author has the right to set boundaries about their body. The dad's response seems to be dismissing the author's feelings and not respecting their wishes. The father's argument that he \"made\" them so he has the right is problematic. No one has the right to touch another person in a way they find uncomfortable unless it's consensual. The fact that the author is 13 means they are in a situation where they might feel pressured to comply, but they have every right to assert their boundaries.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also concerning. Threatening to stop talking or touching the child is not appropriate and could be a form of emotional manipulation. It's important to recognize that respect for personal space and consent is crucial, regardless of familial relationships. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're standing up for themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
