He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 13-year-old male who's had their dad slap their ass since childhood. The dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else. The key point is that the author now wants the dad to stop, but the dad is refusing, saying he made them so he can touch them whenever he wants. The dad even threatened not to talk or touch the author anymore if they don't comply. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to stop.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and personal boundaries. Even if the dad didn't have bad intentions in the past, the author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's refusing to respect the child's wishes and is using threats. The fact that the author is 13 means they are a minor, and their parent should respect their autonomy to some extent, especially regarding physical contact that the minor finds uncomfortable.\n\nIn many cultures, physical affection between parents and children is common, but it's important that the child's comfort is considered. Once the child expresses discomfort, the parent should stop. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's the parent is flawed because parental rights don't override a child's right to personal space and comfort. The dad's threatening behavior (\"screw you\", \"I'll touch you when I want\") is also concerning and could indicate a lack of respect for the child's autonomy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, while parents have certain rights, they also have a responsibility to ensure their children's well-being. Physical contact that causes distress in a child could be a legal concern, especially if it's unwelcome. The author isn't just being picky; they're asserting their right to be free from unwanted touch, which is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to request that their parent stop any contact that makes them uncomfortable. The dad's behavior in refusing and threatening is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
