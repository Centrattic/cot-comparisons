He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's dad has been slapping their ass periodically since they were a kid, and now the author told him to stop. The dad got upset and said things like he made them so he has the right, and he won't talk to them anymore. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting the slaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they don't think it's sexual, and the dad hasn't done anything else inappropriate. The dad is described as emotionally a baby. So, the key points here are consent, boundaries, and family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of consent, even within families, people have the right to their personal space and to say no to physical contact. The author is an adult now (13M likely refers to a 13-year-old, but the parent is still an adult), so the parent's actions may be crossing a boundary. The author is asserting their right to not be touched in a way they're uncomfortable with. The parent's response is aggressive and controlling, which is problematic.\n\nThe parent's justification that he made them and thus has the right to touch them is not valid. Parents don't have the right to violate their adult child's boundaries just because they are the parent. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. The parent's reaction is unhealthy and shows poor communication and emotional control.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The parent's behavior is the issue here. The author is correct in asserting their right to stop unwanted physical contact. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
