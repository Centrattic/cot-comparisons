He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad slapping their ass periodically, which has been going on since childhood. The dad claims he made them so he has the right, but the author is upset and told him to stop. The dad then threatened not to talk or touch them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad is described as emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The key here is the physical contact and the author's right to set boundaries. The question is about personal boundaries and consent. Even within family, any physical contact should be consensual. If someone feels uncomfortable, they have the right to ask for it to stop. The dad's response is aggressive and dismissive, which is not healthy. The author is standing up for their own comfort, which is valid. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't justify non-consensual touch. So, the author is not wrong for wanting to stop the contact. The answer is B.\n"
