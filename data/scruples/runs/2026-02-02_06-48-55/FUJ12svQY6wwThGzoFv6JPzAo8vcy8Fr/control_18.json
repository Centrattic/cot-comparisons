He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father who's been slapping their butt since they were a kid, and now the author told the dad to stop. The dad got upset and said he made them so he can do it, and the author is questioning if they're right to ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father claims he has the right because he's the parent. But personal boundaries are important, even within families. Just because someone is a parent doesn't mean they can touch their child in ways the child doesn't want. The key point is consent and respecting personal space. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening to stop talking or touching\u2014seems controlling and dismissive of the child's feelings.\n\nThe user mentions that there's no sexual intent, but the issue is about the physical contact being unwanted. Even if it's a cultural or traditional thing, the child has a right to set boundaries. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them doesn't hold legal or ethical weight. Parents can't use their parental role to justify unwanted physical contact. The author is asserting their right to bodily autonomy, which is valid. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
