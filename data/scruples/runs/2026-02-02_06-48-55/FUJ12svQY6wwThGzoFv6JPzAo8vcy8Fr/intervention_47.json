He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made them so he has the right, and then said he wouldn't talk or touch them anymore.\n\nFirst, personal boundaries are important. Even if the dad says it's not sexual, the author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's reaction is concerning because he's using his authority as a parent to justify the behavior and then threatening to cut off contact. That's not healthy. Parents should respect their children's comfort levels. The author is an adult now (13 months old? Wait, maybe the user meant 13M as in 13 months? No, probably 13 years old. Wait, the original post says \"my[13M]\" which might be a typo. Maybe 13M is 13 months? But the person is now an adult because they have a parent. Hmm, maybe it's a typo for 13 years old. Let's assume the author is an adult, so they have the right to set boundaries. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, regardless of intent. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's response is controlling and dismissive. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
