He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author recently told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he can do it and that he'll only touch them when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says the dad's actions aren't sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior. But the key issue here is consent and respect for personal boundaries. Even if it's not sexual, any physical contact should be consensual. The author has the right to set boundaries and say no to unwanted touch. The dad's response was dismissive and aggressive, which isn't healthy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
