He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their 13-year-old son's dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad got angry and said he made them so he can touch them whenever. The question is whether the author is right to ask him to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the act of slapping someone's ass without consent can be seen as a violation of personal space. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially in physical interactions. The dad's response of refusing to talk or touch them if they don't comply is concerning. That could be seen as emotional manipulation or abuse.\n\nAge is a factor here. The author is 13, so they're a minor. Parents have some authority, but they also have a responsibility to respect their child's comfort. If the dad is using physical touch that the child finds uncomfortable, it's the parent's responsibility to stop, not the child's to tolerate it. The dad's claim that he \"made\" them doesn't justify the behavior. Parents can't use such reasoning to override their child's boundaries.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also important. Throwing a tantrum and threatening to stop interaction is harmful. It creates a toxic environment where the child might feel they can't express their feelings. The author's action in standing up for themselves is appropriate. They're asserting their right to bodily autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nLegally, a parent can't force a child into physical contact against their will. Even if they're the parent, the child's consent and comfort matter. The dad's behavior is overstepping. The author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
