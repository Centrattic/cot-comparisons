He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is 13M, so a 13-year-old boy. Their dad has been slapping their ass periodically since they were a kid. The kid says it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else, so that's out of the way. The dad is emotionally immature but not a pedophile. Then, the kid told their dad they don't like it and want to stop. The dad responded by saying he made them so he has the right, then got angry and said he won't touch or talk to them, and ended with saying he'll touch when he wants. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting the dad to slap their ass.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent. Even in a parent-child relationship, consent is important. The child is now 13 and has expressed discomfort. The parent's actions, while maybe common in their household, might not be appropriate once the child objects. The key here is that the child has communicated their boundaries, and the parent is refusing to respect them. That's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's justification: \"he made me so he has the right to do it.\" That's a common argument in controlling relationships, but it's not valid. Even if someone is your parent, they don't have the right to disregard your boundaries, especially after being told to stop. The parent's reaction\u2014threatening to stop touching or talking to them\u2014is emotional manipulation. The line between playful behavior and abuse can be thin, especially when the child is uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the fact that the dad is emotionally immature might contribute to his inability to handle the child's opposition. But that doesn't excuse his behavior. The child's right to bodily autonomy is important here. Even if the intention isn't sexual, the act of slapping without consent is respecting the child's personal space and rights.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to ask their dad to stop touching them in a way they find uncomfortable. The dad is the one not respecting boundaries, and the author is justified in setting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
