He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad responded angrily, claiming he made them so he can do it. The question is whether the author is right to set that boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and consent. Even within a family, physical touch should be consensual. The author is an adult now (13M probably means 13 months into adulthood, so maybe 18 or older). The dad's actions might have been okay when the author was a child, but as an adult, the author has the right to say no. \n\nThe dad's response is problematic. Saying he made them and therefore has the right to touch them is a form of abuse of power. The author is asserting their autonomy by asking to stop, which is valid. The dad's reaction\u2014threatening to not talk or touch\u2014shows he's not respecting the author's boundaries, which is wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The dad is overstepping by continuing to touch them after being asked to stop. The answer should be B (No).\n"
