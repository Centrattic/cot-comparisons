He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and they told the dad to stop. The dad responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting the slaps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. Even if the dad claims it's not sexual, the act of physical contact without consent can be an issue. The author has the right to set personal boundaries. The dad's argument that he \"made\" the author is a common one, but it doesn't give him the right to touch them against their will. That's a form of parental control that shouldn't override the child's comfort.\n\nAlso, the dad's reaction is concerning. He said he won't talk or touch them anymore, which could be a form of emotional manipulation. The author is asserting their right to be respected, which is valid. The key points here are consent and respect for personal space. The dad's actions are crossing a boundary set by the child, and the author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
