He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad responded with anger, saying he made them so he can touch them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out the right answer.\n\nFirst, I should consider personal boundaries. The author is an adult now (13 months old in the question? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the user wrote [13M], which might mean 13 months old? But that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 13 months old in terms of the child's age? Wait, no, that's probably a mistake. Wait, the original question is from the Reddit post where [13M] is a placeholder for the user's age, like 13 months, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's 13 years old? Maybe it's a typo. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps the [13M] is the user's age, so maybe 13 months, but that's way too young. Wait, in Reddit's AskTere, the [13M] would usually be the user's age, like 13 months old? That can't be right. Maybe it's 13 years old? Because if the user is an adult, then the dad is slapping their ass as an adult. Wait, if the user is an adult, then the dad's actions are inappropriate. But if the user is a minor, maybe under 18, then it's a different situation. Wait, the user says \"I'm 13M\" but that's unclear. Wait, maybe it's 13 months old? Then the user is an infant, which is impossible. Wait, maybe the [13M] is the user's age in months. If they're 13 months old, then the dad slapping their ass is not okay, but the user is a baby. But the scenario also mentions walking to the kitchen, which a 13-month-old can't do. So maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's 13 years old? Then the user is a teenager. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me read the original question again.\n\nThe original post says the author is \"13M\" which is likely a placeholder for age. Maybe the user is 13 months old, but that doesn't make sense with the context of walking to the kitchen and having a conversation. So perhaps it's a typo and should be 13 years old. Assuming the author is an adult, then the dad's behavior is inappropriate. If the author is still a minor, then the dad's actions are also wrong. But the author is telling the dad to stop, which is their right. So regardless of the age, the author has the right to set boundaries. The dad claiming ownership and refusing to respect the author's wishes is the problem here. So the author is not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
