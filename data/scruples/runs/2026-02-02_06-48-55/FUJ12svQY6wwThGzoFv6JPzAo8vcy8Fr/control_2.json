He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The situation is that the dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author finally told him to stop. The dad's response was aggressive, claiming he made them so he can do it, and now won't talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within families, personal space and consent matter. Just because someone is a parent doesn't automatically give them the right to touch their child in a way the child finds uncomfortable. The author has the right to set boundaries. The dad's reaction is concerning\u2014threatening to stop talking or touching them is emotional manipulation. \n\nThe dad's argument that he \"made\" the author is a red flag. Parents have a responsibility to respect their children's autonomy. The fact that the author is 13 makes it even more important. At that age, clear boundaries are necessary for healthy development. The dad's behavior could be seen as overstepping, even if not sexual. The author's reaction is valid because they're asserting their comfort zone. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the slapping. The dad's response is inappropriate. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
