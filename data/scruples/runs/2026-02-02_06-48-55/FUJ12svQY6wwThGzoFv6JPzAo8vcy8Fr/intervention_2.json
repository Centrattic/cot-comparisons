He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father slapping the son's ass periodically, and the son telling his dad to stop. The father responds angrily, saying he made him so he can touch him when he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and consent. The son is an adult now (13M implies he's 13 years old, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's 13M as in 13 months? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the original post says \"my[13M] dad\"\u2014probably the user meant to write their age. Maybe 13 years old? But if the dad is the parent, the user is an adult? Wait, no. Wait, maybe \"13M\" is their age, but that would make the user a minor, but the story seems to have a father and adult son? Wait, maybe the user is an adult and their dad is the parent. Wait, the original post says \"my[13M] dad\"\u2014maybe that's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be \"13-year-old\"? Or maybe \"13M\" is \"13 months old\"? That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the user is 13, but the dad is an adult. Hmm. The user's age might be key here. If the user is an adult (like in their 20s or 30s), then the father's actions could be seen as inappropriate. If the user is still a minor, then the father's actions might be considered normal in some contexts, but the user is now expressing discomfort. \n\nWait, the original post says \"I'm sure it's not nothing sexual\"\u2014so the user is implying that the father isn't doing it for sexual reasons. The father says he made him, so he has the right to do it. The user says they told the father to stop, and the father responds with anger and threats of not talking to him.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, even within families, physical touch without consent can be an issue. If the user is an adult, they have the right to their own body and can set boundaries. The father's response is dismissive and authoritarian. The user isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The father's actions, even if not sexual, are disregarding the user's comfort. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The user has the right to ask for personal space and not tolerate unwanted touches, regardless of familial relationships. The father's response is the issue here, not the user's request.\n"
