He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has been slapping their ass since they were a child, and the author is now asking the father to stop. The father responded angrily, saying he made them so he has the right, and threatened to not talk or touch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father's behavior has been ongoing, starting from when the author was a child. The author is 13M (maybe 13 years old, male?), and the father is emotionally immaturity but not a pedophile. The key points are consent and respect for personal boundaries.\n\nThe author is asserting their right to set a boundary. Even in a parent-child relationship, individuals have the right to their personal space and to feel comfortable. The father's actions, while perhaps not intended as sexual, are still physical contact that the author is now objecting to. The father's response is dismissive and hostile, which is problematic.\n\nThe father's argument that he \"made\" them so he can touch them is not valid. Parents have the responsibility to respect their children's boundaries as the children grow and express their preferences. The author is clearly communicating their discomfort, which is a healthy aspect of personal development. The father's reaction shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, allowing such behavior without consent can lead to feelings of discomfort or trauma. The author is taking a positive step to address this, which is appropriate. The father's refusal to acknowledge the author's feelings and his threats to cut off interaction are signs of poor communication and a need to re-evaluate his approach.\n\nLegally and ethically, respecting someone's request to stop physical contact is important. The author is not in the wrong for setting this boundary. The father needs to adjust his behavior to respect the son's wishes. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
