He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. The dad has been doing this since they were a kid, and the author told him to stop. The dad's response was aggressive, saying he made them so he can do it, and then threatening to not touch or talk to them. The author is questioning their rights here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad claims it's not sexual and hasn't done anything else, so maybe it's a habitual thing. But the key point is the author's right to set boundaries. Even in a family relationship, personal space and consent are important. The dad's reaction is problematic because he's using his role as a parent to justify physical contact without considering the child's comfort. The author has every right to say they're uncomfortable with it. The dad's threats to cut off contact are also concerning because they use emotional manipulation. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
