He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a father who has been slapping the author's ass periodically since they were a child, and now the author has told their dad to stop. The dad responded with some strong words and threats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father is 13 years old? Wait, wait, no, the user says \"[13M]\" which probably means the author is 13 years old and male. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's the dad's age? No, the user wrote \"my[13M]\", so maybe the author is 13. That's a crucial point. If the author is a 13-year-old child and the father is an adult, then the situation is between parent and child.\n\nSo the father has been slapping the child's ass since they were a kid, and the child is now 13 and tells the dad to stop. The dad reacts by saying he made him so he has the right, and then threatens to not touch or talk to him. \n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the father's actions are appropriate. Even if the father claims it's not sexual and there's no other inappropriate behavior, the act of a parent slapping a child's ass could be seen as a form of physical contact that the child is now objecting to. \n\nIn many contexts, even if the parent and child have a history of such physical contact, the child has the right to set boundaries. The father's response of threatening to not touch or talk to the child is concerning, especially since it's a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nThe author is asking if they are in the wrong for not wanting the physical contact. From a rights perspective, the author should have the right to express discomfort and request boundaries. The father's reaction is dismissive and authoritarian, which could indicate a lack of respect for the child's autonomy. \n\nEven though the father is the parent and may feel entitled to certain actions, that doesn't override the child's right to feel safe and respected. The fact that the author is standing up for themselves by setting a boundary is important. The father's threat to withhold affection or communication could be a form of punishment that's inappropriate for a parent to use.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The father's behavior, particularly the threats, is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
