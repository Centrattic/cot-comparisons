He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The dad says he made them so he has the right, but the author is asserting their boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. Even within a family, any physical contact should be consensual. The dad's argument that he has the right because he's a parent doesn't hold up legally or ethically. Parents have responsibilities but not the right to touch their children in ways the children find uncomfortable, especially if the child is an adult now (assuming the author is an adult given the context).\n\nThe dad's reaction of refusing to talk or touch the author is manipulative. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. There's no indication of sexual intent from the dad, but the author still has the right to say no. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
