He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their dad to slap their ass. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author mentions that their dad has been slapping their ass since they were a kid, and he claims there's no sexual intent. The author recently told their dad to stop, and the dad responded angrily, saying he made them and has the right to do so. The dad then threatened to not talk or touch them anymore. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for asking to stop.\n\nNow, I need to consider boundaries and consent. Even within a family, personal space and consent matter. The dad's actions, regardless of intent, are a form of physical contact that the adult child is now objecting to. The dad's response is dismissive and authoritarian, which is concerning. The author is asserting their right to set personal boundaries, which is a legitimate action. \n\nBut wait, could there be cultural factors? Maybe in some cultures, physical affection between parents and adult children is common. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author is an adult (13M likely means 13 months past 18, making them 19 or 20). As an adult, they have the right to set boundaries. The dad's response of threatening to cut off contact is emotional manipulation, which is not acceptable.\n\nThe dad's argument that he created them so he has the right to touch them is flawed. Parental rights don't extend to disregarding the adult child's comfort. Consent is ongoing, and even if the dad has done this for years, the child can change their stance as they grow up.\n\nSo, the author is justified in their request. The dad is overstepping by not respecting their boundary and reacting violently. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
