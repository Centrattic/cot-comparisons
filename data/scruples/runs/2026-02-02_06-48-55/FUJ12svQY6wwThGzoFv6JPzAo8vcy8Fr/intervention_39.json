He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong when they told their dad to stop slapping their ass.\n\nFirst, the dad has been doing this since the kid was little. The author says it's not sexual and the dad hasn't done anything else. The dad is described as emotionally a baby but not a pedophile. The user says they told their dad they didn't like it and wanted him to stop. The dad responded by saying he made them so he has the right and then said he wouldn't talk or touch them, ending with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it.\"\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the right. The user (the one asking the question) thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are consent and boundaries. Even if the dad thinks it's innocent, the adult child is now saying they don't like it. The dad's argument that he \"made\" them is not a valid reason to touch someone against their will, especially as an adult. The dad's response seems controlling and disrespectful of the child's autonomy. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, which is something people are entitled to. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
