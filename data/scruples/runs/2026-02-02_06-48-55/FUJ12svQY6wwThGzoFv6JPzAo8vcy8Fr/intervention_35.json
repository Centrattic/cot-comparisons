He's emotionally a baby but he's no pedo.\n\nAnyways, today we were walking to the kitchen and he slapped my ass and I told him I didn't like it and that I wanted him to stop. He said he made me so he has the right to do it, and fumed up when I said that he didnt. In his words \"then i wont touch or talk to you, screw you\" he eventually ended with \"I'll touch you when I want, deal with it\" and went to his room.\n\nI'm well within my rights to ask him to stop, right?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The dad has been doing this since the author was a kid, and the author says there's no sexual intent. The situation escalated when the author asked the dad to stop, and the dad responded with anger, saying he made them so he has the right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. The author is an adult now (13 years old, but assuming the post is years later), so they have the right to set their own boundaries. Even if the dad didn't mean anything sexual, the act of physical contact without consent is a problem. The dad's response was threatening, which is concerning. He's using his position as a parent to justify unwanted touch, which isn't okay.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect for personal space, and healthy parent-child dynamics. The author is not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The dad's behavior is inappropriate, especially since he's dismissing the author's feelings and making threats. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
