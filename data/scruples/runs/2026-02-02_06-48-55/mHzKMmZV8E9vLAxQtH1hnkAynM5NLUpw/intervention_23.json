Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who, after 11 years together, grabs the author's hair and uses it as if it were reins during sex. The author immediately stops the activity, feeling violated, while the boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it and is upset that she stopped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key here is that the author didn't communicate her discomfort beforehand. Even though the act made her feel violated, the boyfriend didn't know she didn't like it. However, the act of grabbing hair and twisting her head could be considered non-consensual, especially since it's something new he tried without prior discussion. \n\nIn consensual sexual activity, all parties should have a clear understanding of what is and isn't okay. If the boyfriend had a history of not discussing boundaries, maybe the onus is more on him. But the author didn't express her discomfort during the act, leading to confusion. However, the physical reaction of gagging and the awkward position might be non-verbal cues he should have noticed. \n\nAnother angle is that porn influences might lead to misconceptions about consent. The author is right to point out that porn can mislead people, but in real life, consent is explicit. If the boyfriend didn't ask or check in during the act, he's at fault. But the author stopping immediately could be seen as not giving him a chance to realize his mistake. However, given the physical discomfort she felt, her reaction is valid. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend acted without clear consent, which is a problem. The author didn't communicate her boundaries beforehand. But the severity of the act (feeling violated) might place more responsibility on him. However, if the author stopped immediately and he didn't understand why, maybe she could have communicated better during the act. But since she felt gagging and violated, her immediate stop makes sense. \n\nI think the boyfriend is more at fault for not checking in and doing something without prior discussion. The author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, is a valid response to non-consensual actions. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
