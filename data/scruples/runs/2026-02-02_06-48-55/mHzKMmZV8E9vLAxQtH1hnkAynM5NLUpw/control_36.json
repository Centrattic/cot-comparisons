Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they stopped sex after their boyfriend grabbed their hair and used it as reins. The key points here are consent, communication, and the author's physical reaction.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something the author hasn't done before\u2014grabbing their hair and twisting their head. The author describes it as painful and awkward, making sounds they interpret as trying to say stop. The boyfriend didn't realize it was painful and thought the author was into it. \n\nConsent is crucial here. If the author was not okay with this new act, they have every right to stop it immediately. The boyfriend's lack of awareness about causing pain doesn't override the author's right to halt the activity. The author's reaction\u2014pushing him off and feeling violated\u2014is a clear sign they didn't consent to this act, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand.\n\nCommunication might be an issue in their relationship, but the author's immediate stop is justified. The boyfriend's hurt feelings don't negate the author's right to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own comfort and safety.\n"
