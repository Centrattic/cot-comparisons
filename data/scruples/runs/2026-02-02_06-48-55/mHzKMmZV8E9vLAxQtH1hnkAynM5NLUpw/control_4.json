  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after stopping sex because their boyfriend used their hair as reins. The key points here are consent, communication, and the physical experience.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing the author's hair and twisting their head back. The author describes it as painful and causing them to make sounds that came out as gags instead of words. They immediately stopped the activity, which lasted two minutes. The boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt that she stopped, interpreting it as poor communication and rejection.\n\nThe author felt violated and disgusted, which is a strong emotional reaction. The main issue here is whether the boyfriend's actions were consensual. Even if he thought she was okay with it, if she felt it was non-consensual or painful, then he crossed a boundary. Consent is ongoing and can be revoked at any time. The fact that he didn't realize she was in pain might indicate a lack of attention to her non-verbal cues, which is on him. The author's immediate stop was a valid reaction to her discomfort. The boyfriend's hurt feelings don't outweigh her physical and emotional experience. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping; the responsibility lies with the boyfriend for not recognizing her distress.\n"
