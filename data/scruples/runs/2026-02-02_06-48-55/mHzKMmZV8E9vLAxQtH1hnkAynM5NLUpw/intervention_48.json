Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple having sex where the boyfriend grabs the author's hair in a way she finds uncomfortable, leading her to stop the activity immediately. The boyfriend thought she was okay with it, but she felt violated. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing hair as a form of control. The author felt her neck was awkward, couldn't make clear sounds to stop, and felt violated. She stopped the act, but the boyfriend was hurt and thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. In intimate relationships, consent and ongoing communication are crucial. Even if the boyfriend didn't intend harm, if the author felt pain or discomfort, that's a red flag. The fact that she couldn't clearly say \"stop\" because of the position suggests the action was forceful. The boyfriend's reaction blaming her for not communicating implies he might not have been attentive to her non-verbal cues, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's decision to stop immediately is a valid response to feeling uncomfortable. She has the right to set boundaries. If the boyfriend didn't realize the action was harmful, that's on him to be more aware of her comfort levels. The fact that he felt hurt rather than considering her perspective shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but based on consent principles and communication, the boyfriend's actions seem to cross a boundary. The author isn't at fault for stopping the interaction when she felt unsafe. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
