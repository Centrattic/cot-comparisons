Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which she found painful and non-consensual. She stopped the activity immediately, and he was upset, thinking she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that her boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that was uncomfortable, twisting her head back. She tried to signal stop through sounds but it came out as gags. She felt violated. He thought she was enjoying it and didn't understand her reaction. The author pushed him away and ended the encounter, leading to a conflict where he felt hurt because she \"rejected\" him.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication during intimate activities. The boyfriend's action of grabbing her hair, especially in a way that caused her pain, was unexpected and not something they've done before. The author's immediate reaction to stop the activity when she felt uncomfortable is a clear sign that she didn't want it. He not recognizing her distress signals (like the gags and awkward head position) suggests he might not have paid attention to her non-verbal cues. \n\nIn consensual sex, all participants should be aware of each other's comfort levels and have open communication. The fact that this was a new behavior for him and caused her pain is significant. The author acting on her own feelings by stopping the activity is her right. The boyfriend's reaction, feeling that he was hurt because she didn't continue, shows a lack of understanding of her experience. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether her stopping the activity was justified. Since she felt violated and he didn't recognize her signals, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping. The responsibility lies more on the boyfriend for not respecting her boundaries and misinterpreting her reactions. \n\nAlso, the context mentions that such actions in porn might not reflect real consent, and the author points out that the performers might not actually be enjoying it. This suggests the boyfriend might have been influenced by porn and acted without considering her actual consent and comfort. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a response to something she found painful and non-consensual, and her stopping the activity was appropriate.\n"
