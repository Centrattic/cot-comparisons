  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, which she found painful and violating, and she stopped immediately. He thought she was enjoying it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key point is that the author felt pain and violation. She said he grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her neck, making it hard to make sounds. She tried to communicate stop by gagging sounds, but he didn't notice. Then she pushed him off. He thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. If someone is in pain or uncomfortable, they should stop. The boyfriend's actions here could be considered non-consensual if he didn't check in with her. Using hair as reins, especially causing physical discomfort, might be a form of aggression that wasn't consensual. The author stopping immediately is a clear sign she's not okay with it. Blaming the victim for not communicating is wrong because she couldn't verbalize it due to the situation.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend should have been attentive to her non-verbal cues and stopped. The answer should be B.\n"
