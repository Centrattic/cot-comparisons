  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend of 11 years grabbing the author's hair during sex in a way she found painful and violating. She stopped the activity immediately, and he thought she was enjoying it. She felt violated, he's hurt because she \"rejected\" him.\n\nFirst, consent and communication are key here. The boyfriend did something he hadn't done before without checking in with her. Using hair as reins might be a turn-on for him, but if she didn't anticipate it or find it okay, he should have made sure she was comfortable. The fact that her reactions were gags and struggling to say stop shows she wasn't okay with it. He should have noticed her discomfort and stopped. \n\nShe immediately stopped the act, which is reasonable when someone is making you uncomfortable. His reaction, thinking she was communicating improperly, shows a lack of understanding her consent signals. He should have prioritized her comfort over his feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her disapproval by stopping and pushing him off. His actions were non-consensual in the moment, and he didn't respect her boundaries. The blame isn't on her for rejecting something he forced into the act without her consent. Answer B.\n"
