Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex in a way that caused discomfort and made them feel violated. The author stopped the activity immediately, but the boyfriend thought they were into it and felt hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The boyfriend grabbed the author's hair in a way that twisted their neck, causing them to make sounds that were actually attempts to say stop. The author felt violated and pushed him away. The boyfriend misunderstood and thought the author wasn't communicating properly, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and communication. The author clearly felt that the action was non-consensual and painful, leading to them stopping the act. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't realize that his actions were causing distress and took offense instead of acknowledging the author's discomfort.\n\nIn terms of consent, any sexual activity should be consensual at every step. If one partner is uncomfortable or in pain, the other should stop immediately. The author stopping the activity after the action was taken is a clear signal, even if the boyfriend didn't interpret it correctly. However, the author might have a responsibility to communicate more clearly if they feel something is wrong. But in this case, the author did try to communicate by making sounds, which were misinterpreted as being into it. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he didn't realize he was causing harm and instead blamed the author for not communicating. That's a common issue where the person causing the harm doesn't see their actions as wrong. The author's immediate stop and pushing him away were appropriate responses to being violated, even if they didn't use words to explain.\n\nSo, considering consent and the dynamics of the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the issue, and the author acted to protect themselves. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but based on the details, the author's actions were justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
