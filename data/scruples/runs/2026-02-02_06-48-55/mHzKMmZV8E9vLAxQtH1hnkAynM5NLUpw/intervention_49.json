Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, using it like reins, which she found painful and violating. She stopped the sex immediately, but he thought she was into it and felt hurt that she didn't communicate better. The user is asking if the author is the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in sexual situations. Consent is supposed to be ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time. If someone does something without prior discussion and the other person clearly shows discomfort, that's a problem. The author says she made sounds that were attempts to stop him but he didn't understand. Her immediate reaction was to push him off and stop, which seems like a clear withdrawal of consent.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he thought she was into it. But if he's been with her for 11 years, he should know her signals. Grabbing her hair to the point of pain and twisting her head is not something that's typically consensual without discussion. The fact that she had to stop it immediately suggests that it was unpleasant. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for stopping because she felt violated. She wasn't communicating in words, but her physical reactions (gagging sounds, pushing him off) are clear non-verbal cues. The boyfriend's not recognizing those cues and instead thinking it was a communication issue is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, understanding each other's comfort levels is crucial. The boyfriend should have asked if she was okay with that action beforehand. Since he didn't and she felt violated, the responsibility is on him for not respecting her boundaries. The author's immediate stop wasn't wrong; it was her asserting her boundaries.\n"
