  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after stopping sex when her boyfriend used her hair as reins. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair forcefully. The author felt her neck was twisted, couldn't speak properly, and made sounds that were attempts to say stop. She pushed him off after two minutes, feeling violated. He claims he thought she was enjoying it, leading to a communication issue.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she felt violated and stopped the interaction. She might have prior boundaries she didn't communicate clearly. On the other hand, the boyfriend might not have been aware of her discomfort, either due to lack of communication or misreading her signals.\n\nThe key points are consent and communication. If the author felt violated, even if she didn't explicitly say stop, her actions (trying to say stop, pushing him off) indicate discomfort. The boyfriend's responsibility is to recognize her non-verbal cues and respect her boundaries. The fact that she had to push him off suggests he didn't notice her distress. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend's actions were aggressive and non-consensual once she showed discomfort. The author stopping the sex was a response to a violation, not the cause. So, the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her signals. The author isn't wrong for stopping; she's asserting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
