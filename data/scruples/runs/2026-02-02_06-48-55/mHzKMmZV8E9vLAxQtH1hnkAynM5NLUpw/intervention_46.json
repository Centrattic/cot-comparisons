Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a long-term relationship where the boyfriend used hair as reins during sex, causing the author physical discomfort and emotional distress. The author stopped the sexual activity immediately, but the boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says her boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her head, making it hard to speak or move. She felt violated and stopped the act. The boyfriend didn't realize she was uncomfortable, and the author is now being told by others that maybe she didn't communicate properly. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nCommunication is a big part here. In consensual sexual activity, all parties should be comfortable and have ongoing communication. The boyfriend's action was new\u2014grabbing her hair had never been done before. The author's immediate reaction to stop suggests she didn't consent to this new act. The boyfriend's assumption that she was enjoying it without checking in is problematic. \n\nThe author's physical reactions (neck cocking, gagging sounds, pushing him off) indicate discomfort. Even if she didn't verbally say stop, her body language and the immediate halt to the activity should signal that she's not okay with it. The boyfriend's failure to recognize these signs and his subsequent belief that she \"rejected\" him might indicate a lack of awareness of her boundaries.\n\nThe user might be thinking that the author should have communicated more clearly, but in situations where a new act is introduced that causes immediate discomfort, the right to stop is important. Consent is ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time. The author's action to stop is a clear revocation of consent. \n\nThe boyfriend not understanding why she was upset and attributing it to poor communication suggests he might not fully grasp her experience. The author isn't at fault for stopping an activity that made her feel violated. The boyfriend is responsible for respecting her boundaries once she indicated discomfort. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
