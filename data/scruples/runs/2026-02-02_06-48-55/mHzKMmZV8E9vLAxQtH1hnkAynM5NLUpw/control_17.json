Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, using it as \"reins,\" which caused her physical discomfort and she felt violated. She immediately stopped the activity, but he was hurt and thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says she felt violated and had to push him off because he was grabbing her hair in a way that twisted her head and made her neck awkward. She tried to say stop but couldn't. The boyfriend didn't realize she was in pain and thought she was into it, leading to a conflict where he felt rejected and she felt her boundaries were ignored.\n\nIn terms of consent and communication during sexual activity, it's crucial that both partners are comfortable and that any activity is consensual. If one partner is uncomfortable or wants to stop, the other should respect that immediately. The boyfriend grabbing her hair in a way that caused physical discomfort and made her feel violated is concerning. Even if he didn't realize she was uncomfortable, the fact that she stopped the activity and pushed him off indicates she was not okay with it.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction that he thought she was into it and that she didn't communicate properly seems to miss the point. The author did communicate by stopping the sex and pushing him away. The boyfriend should have recognized her discomfort and stopped immediately. The story mentions that this was a new action for him, and she didn't consent to it before. Using hair as a reins is a specific act that many women might not find consensual or comfortable, even if it's portrayed in some media. The author's reaction is valid as she felt violated, which is a strong indicator that the boyfriend overstepped.\n\nTherefore, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and not recognizing her distress. The author is not in the wrong for stopping the activity and expressing her discomfort. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
