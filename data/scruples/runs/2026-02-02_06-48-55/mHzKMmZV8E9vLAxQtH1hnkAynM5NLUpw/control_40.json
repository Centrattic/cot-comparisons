Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend, after 11 years, grabbed her hair during sex, twisted her head back, causing her discomfort. She immediately stopped the act and pushed him away, feeling violated. The boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it and that she didn't communicate properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The key issue here is consent and communication during sexual activity. The author felt physically uncomfortable and violated because the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before. The boyfriend thought she was into it, but she clearly wasn't. \n\nIn terms of consent, it's important to know that ongoing consent is necessary, and any new or aggressive actions should be discussed. The author tried to signal stop through her sounds, but he didn't recognize it. However, she did stop the act immediately once he let go, which is a direct action to halt the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that she didn't communicate properly. But if someone is in a position where they can't clearly say \"stop\" because their neck is twisted, and their sounds are garbled, that's not their fault. Communication can be non-verbal, and her body language and actions (pushing him away) should be clear signals. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's failure to recognize her discomfort and assuming she was into it despite her reactions is a red flag. He should be more attuned to her signals. The fact that he felt hurt because she rejected him after he thought she was enjoying it shows a lack of understanding of her experience. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong. She had the right to stop the activity when she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend's actions were non-consensual and invasive, and he failed to communicate or pay attention to her signals. The blame shouldn't be on the person who withdrew consent during the act. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
