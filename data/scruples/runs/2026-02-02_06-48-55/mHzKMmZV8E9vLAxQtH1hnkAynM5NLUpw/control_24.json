Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend of 11 years grabbing her hair during sex, using it as reins, which she found painful and violating. She immediately stopped the activity, but he claims he thought she was enjoying it, leading to a conflict about communication.\n\nFirst, I need to assess consent and communication. The woman felt her neck was in an awkward position and couldn't make clear sounds to stop. She tried to say \"stop\" but it came out as gags. This suggests she was uncomfortable and trying to communicate her distress. He didn't notice or choose to ignore her signals, which is a problem.\n\nThe boyfriend introduced a new action (grabbing hair) without prior discussion or checking in with her. Even if they had a long-term relationship, it's important to communicate boundaries during sex. The woman's immediate reaction to push him off and stop shows she felt violated. His response was to think she wasn't communicating properly, which shifts blame onto her, which is not appropriate. \n\nConsent is ongoing and requires active communication. If she was in pain and couldn't express it clearly, it's his responsibility to be attentive. The fact that he used porn as a reference where women might not show discomfort correctly doesn't excuse his actions. He should have been more in tune with her actual reactions.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, partners should know each other's limits. The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries when she signaled discomfort. The woman's actions were justified to stop the activity and set a boundary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend failed to recognize her distress and blamed her for not communicating better, which is a common but incorrect response in such situations.\n"
