Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple in an 11-year relationship where the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair during sex, leading to the author stopping the activity immediately. The author feels violated, while the boyfriend thought she was enjoying it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The key points are: the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before (grabbing hair), it caused physical discomfort (neck in an awkward position, muffled sounds), the author stopped the activity, and the boyfriend felt hurt because he thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nThe author's argument is that the boyfriend's action was aggressive and made her feel violated. The boyfriend's argument is that he thought she was enjoying it and that she didn't communicate her discomfort. The user is unsure but leans towards the author being wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nIn terms of consent and communication in relationships, especially during sexual activity, it's crucial that both partners are on the same page. If the author felt uncomfortable and the boyfriend didn't notice her cues (like the inability to speak and the physical reaction), then it's possible he didn't pick up on her nonverbal signals. However, the author stopped the activity, which is a clear action, but the boyfriend interpreted it as not communicating properly. \n\nIn many discussions about consent, it's emphasized that communication is key. If someone is in a long-term relationship, they should be familiar with each other's boundaries. However, the author's immediate stop might be seen as a valid response if she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend's action of grabbing and twisting her hair could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if it was unexpected. \n\nBut the user's friend thinks the author is wrong. Maybe they believe that the boyfriend's actions were okay and the author should have communicated better beforehand. But in reality, if someone is in a position where they can't communicate (like when their neck is twisted and they can't make clear sounds), that's a red flag. The boyfriend's not noticing her distress and continuing for two minutes suggests he might not have been paying attention or was too focused on his own pleasure. \n\nSo, considering consent and the importance of checking in with a partner during sexual activity, the boyfriend may have violated a boundary without realizing it. The author's immediate stop is a reasonable reaction to feeling violated. The boyfriend's hurt feelings might stem from not understanding that his actions were inappropriate. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She had the right to stop the activity if she felt uncomfortable, especially when her partner didn't notice her distress signals. The responsibility lies with the boyfriend to ensure consent and check in, not the one who feels violated to communicate in a way they can't when physically restricted.\n"
