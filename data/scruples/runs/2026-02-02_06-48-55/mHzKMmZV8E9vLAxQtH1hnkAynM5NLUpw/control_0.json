  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, twisted her head back, and she immediately stopped the sex. He says he thought she was enjoying it, but she felt violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author says he never did that before. She felt pain and couldn't make clear sounds to stop, so she pushed him off. He claims he thought she was okay with it. But she's arguing that his action was aggressive and non-consensual.\n\nIn terms of consent, it's important that both parties are comfortable and agree to any new actions. If he grabbed her hair without prior discussion and it caused her pain, that's a problem. Even if he thought she was okay, the fact that she felt violated suggests that consent wasn't given properly. She had to stop the act immediately, which is her right. So, he should have checked in with her instead of assuming. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of blaming her for not communicating properly is also an issue. If she couldn't voice her discomfort because of the position and pain, how was she supposed to communicate? It's his responsibility to ensure she's comfortable. The fact that he felt hurt because she stopped might indicate a lack of understanding of her boundaries. \n\nSo, the main points are: the boyfriend used aggressive action without prior consent, the author felt violated, and there was a communication breakdown. The author acted to protect herself, which is justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
