Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, the author is a woman in a 11-year relationship with her boyfriend. During sex, he grabs her hair and uses it as reins, twisting her head back. She says she tried to say stop but couldn't make clear sounds, so she sounds like she's gagging. After two minutes, she pushes him off and is disgusted. He claims he thought she was enjoying it, and now it's a communication issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key here is that she didn't ask for him to grab her hair. It's a new behavior for him, something he hasn't done before. The fact that she's reacting negatively and immediately stops the activity suggests she wasn't comfortable. Even if he thought she was into it because of porn, that's not a valid reason. He should have checked in with her, not assumed based on porn. \n\nShe tried to communicate by making sounds, but he didn't pick up on it. That's on him. Consent isn't just verbal; it's about paying attention to non-verbal cues. If he noticed her discomfort, he should have stopped. Her pushing him off is a clear sign she felt violated. His response that it's her fault for not communicating properly is dismissive and invalidates her experience. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, communication is key. If he's into something new, he should discuss it first. Assuming consent without discussion is a problem. The fact that she felt the need to stop immediately shows her boundaries weren't respected. So the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and he's shifting blame onto her. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The boyfriend did something she didn't consent to, and he's not taking responsibility, which is a big issue. The author's reaction is justified given the violation she felt.\n"
