  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for stopping sex when their boyfriend used their hair as reins during a sexual encounter. The key points here are consent, communication, and the physical reaction described.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair in a way that caused pain and discomfort, twisting their head back. The author says they couldn't make proper sounds to say stop and felt violated. That sounds like non-consensual or at least non-communicated behavior. The boyfriend didn't realize the harm, but the author immediately stopped the activity when it happened. \n\nConsent is about ongoing communication. If the action was painful and unexpected, the boyfriend shouldn't have proceeded without checking in. The author's reaction of pushing him away and stopping is a clear boundary. The fact that the boyfriend took it as a communication issue rather than recognizing the violation might indicate his lack of awareness of her discomfort. \n\nThe author didn't have a chance to verbally say stop because their neck was awkward, so their actions (immediately stopping) were a necessary response. The boyfriend's claim that he thought she was enjoying it doesn't excuse his actions. The responsibility is on him to ensure that all actions are consensual and not causing harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping something that was painful and made them feel violated. The boyfriend's actions were the issue here, not the author's decision to stop.\n"
