Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for stopping sex when her boyfriend used her hair as a rein. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The couple has been together for 11 years. During sex, the boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her head, making her neck awkward. She tried to say stop but couldn't make clear sounds, leading to two minutes of this. She then pushed him off, feeling violated. He claims he thought she was enjoying it, leading to conflict about communication.\n\nSo, considering consent and boundaries. The boyfriend did something she wasn't comfortable with, and she felt violated. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, using hair as a rein without prior discussion or consent can be harmful. Her reaction of stopping the activity and pushing him off is her asserting her boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he thought she was enjoying it is problematic. He should have checked in with her, especially when she was making sounds indicating discomfort. The fact that this was something new he did, not something they had discussed before, makes it his responsibility to ensure she was okay with it. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to something that made her feel violated. Stopping the activity immediately was a valid reaction to protect her own well-being. The boyfriend's feelings being hurt due to her not communicating properly is dismissive of her experience. \n\nIn terms of consent, ongoing communication is key. Since he didn't clarify her comfort level and she felt forced into an uncomfortable position, the responsibility lies with the boyfriend. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity when she felt violated. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
