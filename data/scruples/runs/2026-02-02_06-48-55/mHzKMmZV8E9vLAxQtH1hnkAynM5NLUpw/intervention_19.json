Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, twisting their head back, causing discomfort and making them feel violated. The author stops the sex immediately after, and the boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The boyfriend did something during sex that was new to him, which the author hadn't agreed to before. The act of grabbing hair, especially in a way that causes physical discomfort and restricts movement, is a form of non-consensual behavior. The author felt violated and stopped the activity. The boyfriend's response was to think she didn't communicate properly and that she was rejecting him, which led to hurt feelings.\n\nNow, consent is a big part of this. The boyfriend didn't get consent for this specific act. Even if it's part of a style he saw in porn, that doesn't make it okay. The author's reaction is valid because she felt pain and discomfort, and her attempt to communicate through sounds (gags) might not have been clear, but her immediate stop after the act shows she didn't consent to it. The boyfriend's lack of awareness of her discomfort is on him. He should have paid attention to her cues and stopped when she showed signs of distress. \n\nThe author stopping the sex was a necessary action to prevent further harm. The boyfriend's hurt feelings about being rejected are not the priority here. The priority is the author's well-being and safety. So, in this case, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who acted without consent and ignored her non-verbal signals. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
