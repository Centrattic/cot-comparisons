Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which caused her physical discomfort and made her feel violated. She immediately stopped the activity, but her boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in intimate relationships. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something that the author wasn't comfortable with. He grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her neck, caused her to make gagging sounds, and she tried to signal him to stop. However, he didn't notice and continued for two minutes. After she pushed him away, he felt hurt and thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. In consensual interactions, both partners should be attentive to each other's comfort levels. The boyfriend's action of using her hair as restraints, which he hadn't done before, could be seen as a new and potentially aggressive move. The author's reaction\u2014physical discomfort, making sounds indicating distress, and then stopping the activity\u2014suggests she was not enjoying it. If the boyfriend didn't notice these signs, that could indicate a failure on his part to read her cues, which is a common issue in such situations.\n\nHowever, the author did stop the activity once it became uncomfortable. The immediate reaction of pushing him away and expressing disgust shows she took action to communicate her distress. The boyfriend's response was to feel hurt and think it was a communication issue, not his fault. But if the author was clearly uncomfortable and stopped the interaction, it's the boyfriend who's at fault for not respecting her signals. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who initiated the action that caused discomfort (the boyfriend) is more at fault here. The author's right to stop the activity at any time because of her discomfort is a key factor. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend misrepresented her consent by not noticing her signs of distress. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
