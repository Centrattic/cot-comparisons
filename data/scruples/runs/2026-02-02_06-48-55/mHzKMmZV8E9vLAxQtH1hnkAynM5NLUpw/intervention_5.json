Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex and using it as reins, which led to her stopping the activity immediately. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that her boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her head back, making it hard to make sounds and causing her to feel violated. She tried to stop him but couldn't, and it lasted two minutes. After she pushed him away, he was hurt and thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nNow, the main issue is consent and communication during sexual activity. Using hair as a restraint without prior discussion might be seen as non-consensual, especially if the person is not comfortable with it. The author didn't communicate her discomfort before stopping, but she might have been unable to because of the physical restraint. \n\nIn many cases, the person who is uncomfortable or harmed has the right to stop the activity, even if their partner didn't realize it was an issue. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he didn't recognize her discomfort, which could indicate a lack of awareness or communication on his part. The author's immediate stoppage is a valid response to a situation where she felt violated. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have communicated her discomfort earlier or that her reaction was abrupt. But considering the physical restraint and the inability to communicate effectively, her action seems justified. The boyfriend's feeling hurt might be his own emotional response, not the author's fault. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she had the right to stop the activity when she felt uncomfortable, especially when the act itself was causing her physical discomfort and violation.\n"
