  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping sex after her boyfriend used her hair as reins. The key points here are about consent and communication.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something he hasn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair and twisting her head back. The author felt her neck was in an awkward position and couldn't make clear sounds to stop him. The sounds she made were meant to signal stop but came out as gags. She then pushed him off after two minutes, feeling disgusted and violated.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was confusion, thinking she wasn't communicating properly. He felt hurt that she stopped the interaction. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom a consent perspective, any sexual activity requires ongoing, enthusiastic consent. If the author felt pain or discomfort and tried to signal stop, even if the signals weren't clear to the partner, the responsibility isn't on her. The boyfriend, on the other hand, should have been attentive to her reactions and stopped immediately if he noticed discomfort. Using hair as reins can be painful and is a form of control that not everyone consents to. Since she didn't communicate a \"yes\" but instead showed signs of discomfort, the onus is on him to check in and stop. The author's reaction to stop the sex is a valid self-defense against something she didn't consent to. The boyfriend's assertion that he thought she was enjoying it doesn't absolve him of responsibility if he didn't confirm her consent during the act. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping it immediately.\n"
