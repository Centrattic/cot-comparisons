  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex for two minutes, causing discomfort and pain. The author immediately stopped the activity, felt violated, and the boyfriend was hurt, thinking she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key, especially around consent and boundaries. The boyfriend grabbed her hair, which she wasn't expecting and found painful. She tried to signal stop by making sounds, but it came out as gags. He didn't recognize these as a stop signal and continued. \n\nThe boyfriend's action of using hair as a rein is a form of control, which can be non-consensual if not agreed upon beforehand. The author felt violated, indicating she didn't consent to that specific act. The boyfriend's response was to feel hurt and accuse her of not communicating, which shifts the blame to her, even though he didn't acknowledge her distress signals.\n\nFrom a consent perspective, if someone is in pain and signals discomfort, continuing is a violation. The boyfriend didn't check in with her during the act. The author stopping the sex was a valid reaction to pain and feeling violated. The boyfriend's hurt feelings are not a valid reason to dismiss her experience.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and subsequent blame are the issues. The answer should be B (No).\n"
