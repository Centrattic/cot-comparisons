Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after stopping sex when her boyfriend used her hair as reins. The situation involves a 11-year relationship, so there's a history here.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her head, making it hard to speak or move. She felt violated and immediately stopped the encounter. He believed she was into it and thought she wasn't communicating properly. \n\nNow, considering consent and communication. The author didn't like the action and stopped the activity, which is her right. The boyfriend didn't ask for consent beforehand, which is a big deal. Using hair as restraints without prior agreement can be seen as non-consensual, especially if it's new behavior and causes discomfort. The fact that she couldn't make clear sounds to stop and felt gagged suggests it was physically uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's response implies he didn't realize her discomfort, but that doesn't excuse his action. It's on him to check in and ensure she's comfortable. The author acting to stop the interaction is a valid response to something she didn't consent to. \n\nSo the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Her actions were appropriate given the lack of consent and her discomfort."
