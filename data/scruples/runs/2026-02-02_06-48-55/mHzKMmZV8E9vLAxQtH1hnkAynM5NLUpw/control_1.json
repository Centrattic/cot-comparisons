Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex in a way that caused discomfort and pain. The author stopped the activity immediately, but the boyfriend felt she wasn't communicating properly and that she rejected him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in sexual situations. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something they hadn't done before (grabbing hair), which caused physical discomfort. The author felt violated and stopped the act, but the boyfriend didn't realize it was causing pain.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is crucial. If someone does something that causes pain or discomfort, the other person has the right to stop. The boyfriend's claim that he thought she was enjoying it might not absolve him from being responsible for checking in. Pain during sex is a clear signal to stop. The author acting on her own comfort and stopping immediately is a valid response. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of feeling hurt because she \"rejected\" him seems to shift the blame onto the author for not communicating her discomfort more clearly. But in reality, expressing discomfort during sex can be challenging, especially if it's sudden and painful. The onus is on the person causing the discomfort to notice and adjust, not on the partner to articulate it perfectly.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity to protect herself. The boyfriend's actions crossed a line by not respecting her comfort and his subsequent reaction doesn't justify his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
