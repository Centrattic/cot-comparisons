Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a woman in an 11-year relationship with her boyfriend. During sex, he grabs her hair in a way she's never done before, twisting her head back. She describes it as making her neck awkward, and the sounds she made were attempts to say stop but came out as gags. This went on for two minutes, then she pushes him off, feeling disgusted and violated. He thought she was into it and felt hurt when she stopped.\n\nFirst, consent is a big factor here. If she didn't consent to this specific act, then he shouldn't have done it. The author stopped the sex immediately after, which is her right. The boyfriend's argument is that he thought she was into it, but if she didn't communicate that she didn't like it, maybe that's part of the problem. But wait, she says he never did this before. So maybe she didn't have a chance to communicate her boundaries. Also, the way she reacted\u2014feeling violated and disgusted\u2014suggests that it was non-consensual. \n\nAnother angle: communication. If she had a history with him, maybe there were previous discussions about what she likes or doesn't like. But if this was the first time he grabbed her hair like that, she might not have had the chance to say anything beforehand. However, during the act, she tried to say stop but couldn't because of the position. So maybe she didn't make her discomfort clear enough. But if she was making gagging sounds and pushing him off immediately, that's pretty clear. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he didn't understand why she reacted that way and thought she was rejecting him, which hurt his feelings. That seems like he's not taking her reaction seriously. If she felt violated, that's a serious issue. Using hair as reins in a sexual context can be considered degrading or non-consensual, especially if it causes pain or discomfort. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see hair-pulling as part of a rough sex act if both partners are into it, but that requires explicit consent. Since this was new and she didn't consent, then he shouldn't have done it. The author's immediate stop is a valid response. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I don't think so. She had the right to stop the activity if it wasn't consensual. The boyfriend's mistake was not getting consent for this new act. The author's reaction is appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
