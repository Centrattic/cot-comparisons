Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after stopping sex because the boyfriend grabbed her hair and used it as reins, inspired by porn.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something the author hadn't experienced before. He grabbed her hair in a way that forced her head back, causing her physical discomfort and making her want to stop. She tried to communicate stop through sounds but he didn't understand. Then she pushed him off and was disgusted.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The boyfriend didn't ask for consent beforehand. Even if he thought it was okay because of porn, that's not a valid reason. The author felt violated, which is a serious concern. Also, when she tried to stop, he didn't recognize her signals, which is a failure on his part to be attentive to her reactions.\n\nThe author immediately stopped the activity, which is a natural response when someone feels uncomfortable or harmed. She didn't continue despite her discomfort, so she's not at fault. The boyfriend's argument that he thought she was enjoying it doesn't hold up because he didn't check in with her during the act. Assuming consent based on porn is problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't express her discomfort earlier, maybe there's a communication issue, but in this case, she tried to signal stop. The boyfriend's failure to recognize her signals and his hurt feelings about her stopping are not valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions breached consent boundaries, and the author rightly stopped the interaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
