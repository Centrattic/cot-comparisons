Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, using it as reins, which is something she didn't like. She immediately stopped the sex because he was twisting her head back, causing her to make gagging sounds instead of enjoying it. She felt violated and pushed him off, but he thought she was into it and felt hurt that she stopped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something (grabbing her hair) that she didn't consent to and that she found painful or uncomfortable. She says he had never done that before, so there's no prior indication that she was okay with it. The fact that she immediately stopped the activity after he did this suggests she was not comfortable. \n\nIn healthy sexual relationships, communication is crucial. If one partner is doing something that the other finds unpleasant, it's important to check in. The boyfriend's reaction that he thought she was into it might indicate a lack of attention to her non-verbal cues, like the gagging sounds and the awkward position of her neck. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014stopping the sex immediately and pushing him away\u2014seem like a clear response to not wanting the activity to continue. Her feeling of being violated is significant here. The boyfriend's hurt feelings come from her stopping, but that seems misplaced because his actions were the ones that caused discomfort. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she didn't consent to the hair-pulling and felt violated, it's not her fault she stopped the act. The responsibility lies with the partner to ensure the other is comfortable. The fact that he didn't realize she was uncomfortable until she pushed him off suggests he might not have been paying attention to her signals, which is on him. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
