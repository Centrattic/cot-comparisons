Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, which she found painful and violating, so she stopped and pushed him off. He thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt that she didn't continue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says her boyfriend did something he never did before\u2014grabbing her hair in a way that twisted her head and made it hard to breathe. She tried to say stop but couldn't, and after two minutes, she pushed him off. He claims he thought she was okay with it, but she felt violated. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is crucial. If someone is uncomfortable or in pain during any activity, especially intimate ones, they have the right to stop. The boyfriend's action of grabbing her hair in a way that caused her physical discomfort raises red flags. Even if he thought she was okay, consent requires checking in and respecting boundaries. The fact that she immediately stopped after he let go shows she acted on her discomfort. Her reaction of feeling violated and pushing him off is a valid response to something she didn't consent to or find enjoyable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings, blaming her for not communicating properly, which is a common deflection. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping something that made her feel violated. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
