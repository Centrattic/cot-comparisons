  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping sex after their boyfriend grabbed their hair in a way that hurt them. The key points here are about consent and communication.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something new\u2014grabbing hair as reins\u2014which the author found painful and unpleasant. The author felt violated because the boyfriend didn't think they were into it, but that's not the point. Consent is about clear, ongoing agreement. If he did something without checking with her, that's a problem. \n\nThe author tried to signal stop by making sounds, which he didn't understand. But non-verbal cues can be ambiguous, especially in a sexual context. He might not have realized it was a problem because of that. However, the fact that she had to push him off and stop the activity shows her discomfort was clear. \n\nHe's framing it as miscommunication, but the issue is that he didn't ask for consent for a new act that made her uncomfortable. The author's right to stop the activity because of his actions is valid. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
