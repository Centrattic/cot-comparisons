  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping sex after her boyfriend grabbed her hair and used it as reins. The key points here are consent, communication, and understanding boundaries.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair and twisting her head. The woman felt pain and couldn't make clear sounds to stop, which led to her pushing him off. She felt violated and says he didn't think she was enjoying it. He, on the other hand, thought she was okay with it and felt hurt when she stopped.\n\nConsent is about clear, ongoing agreement. If the woman was in pain and couldn't communicate properly, that's a red flag. The boyfriend introducing a new action without checking in on her comfort level might be the issue. The woman stopping the encounter immediately after feeling violated isn't wrong. She has the right to set boundaries and stop if she's uncomfortable. The fact that he didn't realize she was in pain suggests he might not have been attentive to her non-verbal cues, which is on him. The woman isn't in the wrong for stopping; the responsibility lies with the partner to ensure mutual comfort. So the answer should be B.\n"
