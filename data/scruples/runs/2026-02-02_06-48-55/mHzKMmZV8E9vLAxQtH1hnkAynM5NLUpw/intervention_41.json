Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. So the situation is about a couple in a long-term relationship where the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex in a way that she found painful and felt violated. She stopped immediately, but he thought she was into it. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote this) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend had never grabbed her hair before. She felt her neck was in an awkward position, couldn't make proper sounds because her head was twisted back, and was making gagging noises. She stopped the activity, pushed him off, and felt disgusted and violated. He, on the other hand, claimed he thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt that she stopped.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication. In a sexual relationship, especially a long-term one, it's important that both partners are comfortable and express their boundaries. The boyfriend initiated something new (using hair as reins) without prior discussion. The author felt pain and tried to stop but couldn't articulate it because of the physical position. That's concerning because if someone is in pain and can't even communicate properly, that's a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he didn't notice her discomfort. However, if the action caused her physical distress and she immediately stopped, it's not about communication failure on her part. She couldn't make clear sounds, so maybe he should have been more attentive to her non-verbal cues like the awkward head position and gagging. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person applying the action (the boyfriend) has the duty to ensure the other isn't harmed. The fact that he thought she was into it isn't an excuse if his actions caused her pain. The author's response was appropriate given the violation. So the boyfriend's actions were wrong, and the author isn't at fault for stopping. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
