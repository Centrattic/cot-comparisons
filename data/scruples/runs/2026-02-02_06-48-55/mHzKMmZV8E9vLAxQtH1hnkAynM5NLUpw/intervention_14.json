  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which she found painful and violating. She stopped the act immediately, but he felt hurt and thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair in a way that caused her pain. She tried to signal stop through her sounds, which he didn't recognize. She then pushed him off. He felt she didn't communicate well, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of consent, any non-consensual act during sex is a big no-no. If the partner is causing pain without checking in, that's a problem. The fact that she immediately stopped suggests she felt uncomfortable. However, some might argue she should have communicated more clearly, but in the heat of the moment, it's hard to say no, especially if it's painful. Also, using hair as \"reins\" as described sounds aggressive and not consensual. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014that he thought she was into it\u2014could indicate a miscommunication or lack of attention to her cues.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? If she stopped the activity as soon as it happened and was clear in her reaction (pushing him off), maybe not. The boyfriend's responsibility is to check in and ensure she's comfortable. However, some might think she should have said \"no\" verbally before stopping, but realistically, when someone is in a painful position and can't make clear sounds, it's not their fault. So the blame lies more on the boyfriend for not respecting her signals. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend is. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
