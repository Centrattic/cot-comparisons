Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for stopping sex after their boyfriend grabbed their hair in a way that made them feel violated. The boyfriend claims he thought they were enjoying it, and he didn't understand their reaction. The user says it was painful, their neck was in an awkward position, and they tried to stop but couldn't make clear sounds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. In any sexual activity, all parties must have clear and ongoing consent. If the boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that caused pain and she couldn't communicate to stop, that's a problem. Using hair as \"reins\" sounds like a form of control that wasn't previously discussed. The user says he had never done that before, so it wasn't part of their established dynamics. Even if he thought she was into it based on porn, that's not a valid reason to impose that without her consent. She felt violated, which is a serious issue. Her immediate reaction to stop was appropriate because she didn't want to continue once he stopped. The boyfriend's insistence that he thought she was okay might not excuse the action, especially if he didn't check in with her during or after. The fact that she couldn't make clear sounds to stop him suggests he wasn't paying attention to her non-verbal cues. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and she acted to protect herself.\n"
