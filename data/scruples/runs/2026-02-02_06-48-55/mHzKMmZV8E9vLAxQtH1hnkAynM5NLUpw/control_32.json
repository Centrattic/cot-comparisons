  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who grabbed her hair during sex, using it like reins, which she clearly didn't like. She stopped immediately, pushed him off, and feels violated. He thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt she rejected him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key point is that the man did something she hadn't done before and she clearly didn't like. She tried to communicate stop by making noises, but he didn't get it. He claims he thought she was into it, but that's his assumption. She felt violated, which is a serious issue. \n\nIn the context of a relationship, even if he thought he was \"acting out a porn scene,\" she has the right to set boundaries. If she's not comfortable, he shouldn't proceed. The fact that he didn't realize she was uncomfortable might be due to him not paying attention to her non-verbal cues. But the responsibility is on him to check in, not just assume. \n\nThe author stopped the act immediately, which is a clear boundary. He didn't respect that when he thought she was into it. His feelings being hurt are secondary here. The main issue is her violation and lack of consent for that specific act. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is responsible for respecting her boundaries and ensuring her consent. The author acted correctly in stopping the activity when she felt uncomfortable.\n"
