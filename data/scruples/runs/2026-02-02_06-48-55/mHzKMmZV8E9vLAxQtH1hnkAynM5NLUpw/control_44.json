Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex in a way that felt aggressive. She immediately stopped the encounter, but he thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt that she didn't continue.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman felt violated and was trying to say stop, but her communication wasn't verbal. She had long hair and he grabbed it forcefully, twisting her head back. She says the sounds she made were attempts to stop. He didn't realize she was uncomfortable, thinking she was into it. After she pushed him off, the argument was about communication and rejection.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication. In any relationship, especially during intimate moments, it's crucial to have clear communication. If the person felt pain or discomfort and tried to signal that but it wasn't clear, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. But the woman's reaction of pushing him off and feeling violated is a strong indicator that she didn't consent to that action. The boyfriend's response suggests he didn't recognize her non-verbal cues, which is a problem on his part.\n\nThe woman didn't explicitly say \"stop\" verbally, but her physical reaction (neck in an awkward position, gagging sounds) could be seen as non-verbal cues. However, relying on non-verbal cues for consent can be risky because people might misinterpret them. The boyfriend should have been more attuned to her comfort levels and asked if she was okay, especially since it was a new action for him. He might have assumed she was into it because of what he saw in porn, which can distort real-life expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman could have been more explicit in communicating her discomfort during the act. However, when someone is in a vulnerable position and feeling violated, it's difficult to communicate clearly. The responsibility lies more on the person initiating the action to ensure consent is ongoing and explicit. The boyfriend's feelings being hurt over rejection might be less important compared to her feeling violated. \n\nIn terms of consent, it's about mutual and ongoing agreement. If he didn't realize she was uncomfortable, that's his failure to check in with her. The woman acting on her feelings of violation and stopping the activity is her right. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
