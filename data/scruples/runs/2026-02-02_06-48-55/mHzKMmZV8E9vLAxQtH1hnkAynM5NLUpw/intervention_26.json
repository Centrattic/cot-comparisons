Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who stopped sex after her boyfriend of 11 years used her hair as reins during a sexual encounter. She felt violated because he grabbed her hair in a way that hurt her, and she couldn't communicate her discomfort because it made her gag. He didn't realize she was uncomfortable and thought she was enjoying it, leading to a conflict where he felt rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The woman immediately stopped the activity when she felt pain and discomfort. She tried to communicate by making sounds but couldn't get through. The boyfriend didn't realize she was uncomfortable and continued, which she saw as a violation. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nIn terms of consent and communication, it's crucial. Consent is an ongoing process, and any activity that causes discomfort or pain should be stopped immediately. The woman had the right to stop the interaction when she felt violated. The boyfriend's failure to recognize her discomfort could be due to lack of communication or not paying attention to her non-verbal cues. However, the woman's immediate stop and her reaction are justified if she felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. I need to consider if the woman overreacted. Given that the boyfriend's action was new (he'd never grabbed her hair before) and caused her physical discomfort, her reaction seems reasonable. She might not have had prior discussions about this specific act, so her immediate stop is a way to set a boundary. The boyfriend's hurt feelings because she stopped might be his issue, but the priority is her well-being.\n\nIn relationships, especially intimate ones, clear communication is key. The boyfriend should have noticed her discomfort and stopped. The woman's right to say no and stop the activity at any time is her right. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
