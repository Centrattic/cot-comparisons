Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex and using it as reins, which she found painful and violating. She immediately stopped after he let go, and he thought she was into it. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points from the story are that the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before, which caused her physical discomfort and made her feel violated. She tried to communicate by making sounds, which she says came out as gags, but he didn't understand. He thought she was enjoying it, but she felt he didn't think she was into it.\n\nIn consensual sexual activity, it's crucial that both partners are comfortable and communicating. If she felt pain and discomfort during the act and tried to signal stop but he didn't understand, that's a communication issue. However, the responsibility for clear communication lies with both partners. But in this case, she says she made sounds that were attempts to stop, but he didn't get it. That might mean she didn't communicate clearly enough, but if she was physically unable to speak clearly, maybe he should have noticed. Also, he had never done this before, so maybe she expected he'd know not to do it unless she agreed. However, he might not realize the impact of his actions.\n\nThe author immediately stopped after he let go, which is a good sign. He felt hurt, thinking she didn't want to continue. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for stopping because she didn't communicate better or if he's in the wrong for not respecting her comfort level.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should prioritize each other's comfort and consent. If he grabbed her hair in a way that caused her pain and she couldn't comfortably continue, then he was out of line. The fact that she felt violated and had to push him away suggests that his actions were non-consensual. However, if she didn't clearly say stop or physically stop the action, maybe that's a point. But in this case, she did stop immediately once he let go, which might be a clear signal. Also, her physical reaction (neck cocked awkwardly, gagging sounds) might be a non-verbal cue he should have picked up on.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and she was within her right to stop. The fact that he didn't realize she was uncomfortable points to his misreading the situation, not her being at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
