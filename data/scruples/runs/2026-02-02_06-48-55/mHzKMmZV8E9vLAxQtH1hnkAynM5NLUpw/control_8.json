  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, using it as reins, and her stopping immediately because it felt painful and violating. She says he didn't realize she was in pain, and now he's upset she stopped.\n\nFirst, communication is key in any relationship, especially during intimacy. The boyfriend did something he hadn't before, which was grabbing her hair and twisting her head back. The author felt pain and couldn't make clear sounds to stop, leading to her pushing him off. \n\nThe boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it. But the author is clear that there's no way he thought she was. This suggests a miscommunication. However, in consensual activities, partners should be attuned to each other's comfort levels. If there's pain or discomfort, stopping is a valid response. The author's immediate reaction to stop is justified, especially if she felt violated. \n\nThe boyfriend's upset about being rejected might be more about his feelings of rejection than understanding her pain. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and stopping the activity. She didn't communicate verbally because she couldn't, but her actions (pushing him away) and the physical reactions (sounds indicating pain) should have been clear signals. \n\nIn consent, the responsibility isn't solely on the person experiencing discomfort to communicate; the other partner should also be attentive. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping. The boyfriend's lack of awareness is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
