Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair during sex, twisting their head back, causing them to gag and feel violated. The author stopped the activity immediately, but the boyfriend thought the author was enjoying it and felt hurt when the author pushed them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author felt violated, which is a strong indicator that something went wrong. The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that caused physical discomfort, and the author couldn't communicate clearly because it was awkward. The author tried to say stop but ended up gagging, so maybe their communication was non-verbal (like body language or sounds) which the boyfriend didn't recognize. \n\nIn consensual sex, all parties should be comfortable and communicate their boundaries. If the author felt pain or discomfort and stopped the activity, it's their right to do so. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he didn't realize the action was harmful, which might indicate a lack of awareness or communication on his part. The author didn't have a chance to clearly say stop because of the physical position, so the immediate stop makes sense as a self-protective measure. \n\nThe boyfriend's hurt feelings might be a result of not understanding that the action was non-consensual or harmful. The author's reaction of being disgusted and feeling violated is a clear sign that the action was not wanted. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the boyfriend's action of grabbing the hair in a painful way likely crossed a boundary. The author stopping is a reasonable response. The boyfriend not recognizing the signs that the author was uncomfortable might mean he's the one who didn't communicate or read the cues properly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping because they were in discomfort and felt violated. The boyfriend might be the one at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
