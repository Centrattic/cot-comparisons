Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, which she found painful and violating, leading her to stop immediately. He thought she was into it and felt hurt when she stopped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before, and the author felt it was painful and not consensual. She tried to communicate by making sounds but couldn't clearly say \"stop\" because of the position. He didn't realize she was uncomfortable, which led to her feeling violated.\n\nIn any sexual relationship, consent is ongoing and must be enthusiastic. If a partner does something new without checking in, and the other person shows discomfort, that's a problem. The author's immediate reaction to stop is a form of consent withdrawal. The boyfriend's not recognizing her non-verbal cues is a failure to communicate and respect her boundaries. \n\nHer feeling violated is valid because she didn't consent to that act. The man's response placing blame on her for not communicating properly is a common issue where the person in the wrong deflects responsibility. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she had the right to stop when she felt uncomfortable, and the boyfriend should have respected her boundaries.\n"
