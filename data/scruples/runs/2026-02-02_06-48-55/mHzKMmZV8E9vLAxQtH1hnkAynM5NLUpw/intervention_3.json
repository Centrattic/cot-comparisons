Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The question is about a situation where the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, using it like reins, and she immediately stopped. She felt violated, but he thought she was into it. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair and twisting her head back, which caused her discomfort and she tried to signal to stop. He didn't notice her cues and continued for two minutes. She then pushed him off. He claims he thought she was okay with it, leading to a conflict about communication.\n\nThe author is wondering if she's in the wrong. The user's own thought is that she might be, but they're not sure. I need to evaluate based on consent and communication in sexual contexts.\n\nIn sexual relationships, consent is ongoing and can be revoked at any time. If the person is causing discomfort or pain, they should stop immediately. The boyfriend didn't notice her nonverbal cues (gags, trying to say stop), which is a failure to read her signals. She did communicate by stopping the sex, which is a clear action. However, the boyfriend's claim that he thought she was into it might rely on his own perception, but if he didn't check in or pay attention to her reactions, that's his fault.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014stopping and pushing him off\u2014are her asserting her boundaries. She felt violated, which is a serious issue. The boyfriend's responsibility is to ensure all activities are consensual and that he's attentive to his partner's responses. If she was in pain and couldn't communicate verbally, he should have stopped upon noticing her discomfort.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she had the right to stop the activity when she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her signals and assuming consent without checking in. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
