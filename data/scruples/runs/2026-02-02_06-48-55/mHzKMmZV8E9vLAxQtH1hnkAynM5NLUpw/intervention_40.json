Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey're in a 11-year relationship with their boyfriend. During sex, he grabbed their hair as if using it as reins, which the author didn't like. The author stopped the act immediately, feeling disgusted and violated. They mention that this was the first time the boyfriend did this, and they felt their neck was twisted awkwardly, making it hard to speak. They tried to signal to stop but couldn't make clear sounds, and it lasted for two minutes before they pushed him off. The boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it and didn't understand why she reacted that way. The author feels hurt because the boyfriend didn't realize she wasn't into it and now blames her for not communicating properly.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider consent and communication. The author felt violated and stopped the activity because they didn't like the hair being used as reins. The boyfriend didn't realize she wasn't enjoying it, which suggests a breakdown in communication. However, the author tried to communicate by making sounds they thought were \"stop\" but came out as gags. Maybe the boyfriend didn't understand these signals. But if the author felt violated, their immediate reaction of stopping and pushing him away seems appropriate. \n\nUsing someone's hair as reins can be painful and non-consensual if not discussed beforehand. Since this was the first time, the boyfriend might not have known the author's boundaries. However, the author didn't verbally communicate their discomfort during the act, relying on non-verbal cues which might not have been clear. But if the author felt pain and violation, it's understandable they didn't want to continue. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of feeling hurt and blaming the author for not communicating properly might indicate he didn't take her immediate reaction as a clear stop. However, the author's actions (pushing him away, stopping) are valid responses to feeling violated. In consensual sex, both parties should be comfortable and communicate their limits. The fact that the author felt the need to stop immediately suggests that the boyfriend overstepped a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the author could have communicated their discomfort earlier. However, in the heat of the moment, especially if they felt unable to express themselves clearly (due to their neck being twisted), it's not their fault. The key point is that the author felt violated, and their reaction was to stop. The boyfriend's failure to recognize that he was causing discomfort is more on him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to stop the activity when they felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend should have been more attentive to her non-verbal cues and respected her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
