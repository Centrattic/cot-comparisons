  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong when she stopped sex because her boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way she found uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the scenario. The couple has been together for 11 years. During sex, the boyfriend suddenly starts using her hair as \"reins,\" twisting her head back, which causes physical discomfort and makes it hard for her to communicate. She tried to say stop but could only make gagging sounds. After two minutes, she pushes him off, feeling violated, and he's upset because he thought she was into it.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication. In any sexual situation, all parties must have clear, ongoing consent. If one partner is uncomfortable or in pain, the other should stop immediately. The boyfriend's action of grabbing her hair was unexpected and caused discomfort, which is a red flag. The author tried to signal stop but couldn't due to physical constraints. Her reaction is a natural response to being in a painful situation\u2014pushing him off to stop the act.\n\nHe claims he thought she was enjoying it, which is a common excuse in cases where someone ignores non-verbal cues. The key point is that consent can't be assumed, especially when there's a clear indication (like trying to say stop, physical discomfort) that the person isn't okay with it. The boyfriend's hurt feelings seem misplaced because the priority should be his partner's well-being and comfort.\n\nThe author stopping the activity immediately was the correct action. She had the right to remove herself from a situation that made her feel violated. The boyfriend's reaction shifting the blame to her for not communicating properly is a form of gaslighting. He should have been more attentive to her signals and stopped when she tried to communicate distress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: the boyfriend acted in a way that caused harm without checking in with her first. The author acted to protect herself. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
