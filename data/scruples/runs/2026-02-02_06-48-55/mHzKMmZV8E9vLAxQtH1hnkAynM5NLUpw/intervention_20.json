Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with her boyfriend of 11 years. During sex, the boyfriend grabs her hair and uses it as reins, twisting her head back. She feels this is aggressive and painful, to the point where she can't even speak properly, just making gagging sounds. She stops the sex immediately after he loosens his grip, and she pushes him away, feeling violated. He says he thought she was enjoying it, and the situation turns into a disagreement where he feels rejected and she feels he didn't respect her boundaries.\n\nThe author is asking if she's at fault here. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding consent and preferences during intimacy. The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that was new to their relationship and caused her physical discomfort. She tried to signal stop by making sounds but wasn't able to communicate verbally. After the fact, he didn't understand why she reacted that way. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. If he didn't ask for permission first and it caused her harm, then he's overstepping. She had the right to stop immediately when she felt uncomfortable. Pushing him away after being in pain is a natural reaction. The boyfriend not recognizing her distress and feeling rejected instead of taking her boundaries seriously is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't at fault for stopping the activity when she felt it was harmful. She had the right to set boundaries and halt the interaction. The boyfriend's actions were the initial issue, not her response. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
