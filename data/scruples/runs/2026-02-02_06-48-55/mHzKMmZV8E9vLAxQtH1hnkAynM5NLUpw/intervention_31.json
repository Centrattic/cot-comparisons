Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-term boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, which she found painful and violating. She stopped the sex immediately after, but he thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt she rejected him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, consent and communication in relationships are key. The boyfriend did something he hadn't done before, and it caused physical discomfort. The author tried to signal stop by making sounds, but it wasn't clear to him. She then pushed him off and felt violated. He misinterpreted her actions, leading to conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend grabbing hair as a form of control might be something she wasn't comfortable with. If he had asked or checked in, maybe it could have been avoided. However, she didn't explicitly say stop until after, which might be part of the issue. But given the physical reaction and the awkward position, it's possible he didn't notice her discomfort. The fact that it was a new behavior for him could also play a role. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she felt violated, then she's justified in stopping. The boyfriend's lack of attention to her signals might be his fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She acted to protect herself, and he should have respected her boundaries.\n"
