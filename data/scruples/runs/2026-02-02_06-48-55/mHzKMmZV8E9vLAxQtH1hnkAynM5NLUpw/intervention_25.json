Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which they found painful and degrading. The author immediately stopped the activity and pushed him away, feeling violated. The boyfriend, however, claims he thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt by her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The boyfriend used the author's hair as \"reins,\" which she never agreed to beforehand. The act caused her physical discomfort and made her feel violated. She tried to signal for him to stop but he didn't notice, leading her to end the encounter abruptly. The boyfriend's reaction is that he thought she was into it, and she's now in the wrong for not communicating better.\n\nSo, the central issues are consent, communication, and the boyfriend's actions. Consent is crucial in any sexual activity. If the boyfriend did something the author hadn't consented to and it made her feel violated, that's a problem. The fact that she tried to make sounds to stop him but he didn't understand could indicate a failure in communication from his side. However, the author did stop the act immediately, which might be seen as her right to set boundaries. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. In many cases, especially when there's a power dynamic, the person initiating the action (the boyfriend) is responsible for ensuring consent and comfort. If he didn't ask and proceeded with something uncomfortable, that's on him. The author's right to say no or stop at any time is important. Her reaction is understandable given the violation of her boundaries. The boyfriend's hurt feelings are less about the issue here; his actions were the root cause. \n\nAlso, the mention of porn influencing his behavior is a red flag. Using aggressive acts without checking in with the partner can lead to misunderstandings and harm. The author's actions\u2014stopping and pushing him away\u2014were her way of asserting her limits. It's possible he didn't realize the severity of his actions because he misinterpreted her reactions, but that doesn't excuse the lack of consent and attention to her signals. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the issue, and her immediate stop was a legitimate response to protect her well-being. The responsibility lies with him to listen and respect her boundaries, not the other way around. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
