Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-term boyfriend grabbing the woman's hair during sex in a way that felt forced and uncomfortable, leading her to stop immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The woman says she made sounds that were trying to say stop, but they came out like gags. She felt violated. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thought she was into it and didn't understand her reaction. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate their boundaries and limits. If she was trying to stop but her signals weren't clear, that might be a point. But if he grabbed her hair without prior discussion, that's a red flag. Using hair as reins without checking in could be non-consensual. \n\nThe key here is whether he had a responsibility to read her cues. Even if he didn't realize her sounds meant stop, she was physically trying to move or resist (neck cocked awkwardly, pushing him off). That physical reaction should be a clear signal. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't notice her discomfort and instead felt hurt when she stopped suggests a lack of attention to her experience. The author's immediate stopping is a response to being hurt, which is a valid reaction. But maybe she should have communicated more clearly beforehand?\n\nWait, but in the moment, if someone is in pain and trying to stop, the onus is on the partner to stop immediately. It's not the person's fault for not being able to communicate clearly in a painful situation. The boyfriend should have picked up on her physical discomfort and stopped. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping when she felt violated. The boyfriend's actions were the issue because he didn't ask or check in, and didn't notice her pain. The blame should be on him for not respecting her boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
