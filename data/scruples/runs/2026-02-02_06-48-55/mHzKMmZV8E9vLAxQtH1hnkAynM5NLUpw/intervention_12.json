Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend of 11 years who grabbed her hair during sex and used it as reins, causing her physical discomfort and making her feel violated. The author immediately stopped the activity, pushed him away, and now her boyfriend is hurt and thinks she didn't communicate properly. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend did something he hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair in a way that twisted her head back. The author felt physical discomfort and couldn't make clear sounds, interpreting them as trying to say stop. She stopped the activity right away. The boyfriend, however, thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt that she stopped, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nFrom a consent and communication perspective, if someone is engaging in an activity that causes physical discomfort or pain, the immediate right is to stop if they're not comfortable. The boyfriend's actions were unexpected and caused harm, which might not have been discussed beforehand. The author's reaction of stopping and pushing him away is a natural response to feeling violated. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that he thought she was into it and felt rejected when she stopped.\n\nIn many discussions about consent, ongoing and enthusiastic consent is crucial. If the act wasn't consensual because it caused discomfort, then the author had the right to stop. The boyfriend's failure to notice her discomfort or misinterpreting her reactions could be a communication issue on his part. The author might have a responsibility to communicate her boundaries clearly, but in a situation where physical actions are causing pain, immediate stopping is a valid response. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that he might have taken her stopping as rejection rather than understanding her discomfort. The author might not be in the wrong because her safety and consent are paramount. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be responsible for not checking in and respecting her boundaries once she indicated discomfort.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). Her actions were a response to feeling violated and physically uncomfortable, which is a valid reason to stop. The boyfriend's misunderstanding doesn't place the blame on her for stopping the activity.\n"
