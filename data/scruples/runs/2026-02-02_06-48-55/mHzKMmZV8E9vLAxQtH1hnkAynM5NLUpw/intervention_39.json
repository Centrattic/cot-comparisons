  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a couple where the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair during sex, using it as reins, which the author found painful and non-consensual. The author immediately stopped the sex, and the boyfriend felt confused because he thought she was enjoying it. The author is now seeking opinions on whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something new (grabbing hair) that the author hadn't agreed to before. The author felt pain and discomfort, tried to signal stop with sounds that came out as gags, and then pushed him away. The boyfriend claims he thought she was okay with it, leading to a conflict where communication was lacking.\n\nIn healthy sexual relationships, consent must be ongoing and enthusiastic. If one partner does something that the other finds painful or uncomfortable without checking in, that's a problem. The author stopping the sex immediately is a reaction to non-consensual behavior. The boyfriend's response of feeling hurt because they thought communication was the issue suggests he didn't recognize the signals or didn't prioritize her consent.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity when it became painful. The responsibility for understanding consent and checking in with the partner lies with the person initiating the action (the boyfriend). His not recognizing the signs and dismissing her reaction as poor communication indicates he's at fault here. The author's priority was her own comfort and safety, which is right. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
