Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a boyfriend using hair as reins during sex, causing discomfort, and the author stopping it. The boyfriend didn't realize she wasn't enjoying it.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. If the author felt violated, that's a serious issue. But the boyfriend says he thought she was into it. The question is whether she should have communicated better. However, the author tried to stop him by making sounds, which were misunderstood as moans. That's a problem. Maybe she should have been clearer, but also, he should have noticed her discomfort. \n\nWait, the author says she pushed him off immediately. Maybe she didn't ask him to stop first. But she was gagging and making noises that were meant to signal stop. If he didn't understand, that's on him. Also, using hair as a hold can be painful and non-consensual if not discussed beforehand. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he thought she was okay with it. But if she's trying to communicate she's not, then he's not taking her cues. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping something that made her uncomfortable. The boyfriend should have paused if he noticed her discomfort. So the answer is B, the author isn't at fault.\n"
