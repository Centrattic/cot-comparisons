Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple having sex where the boyfriend grabs her hair and uses it like reins. The woman stops immediately, feels violated, and the boyfriend is confused because he thought she was okay with it. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend did something they hadn't done before\u2014grabbing her hair and twisting her head back. The woman felt pain and couldn't make clear sounds to stop, leading her to push him off. She felt violated, but he thought she was enjoying it. The argument now is about communication and his feelings getting hurt.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. I need to apply some general principles here. Consent is crucial in any physical activity. If someone is uncomfortable or in pain, their partner should respect that immediately. Even if there was a prior agreement or a miscommunication, the moment someone shows signs of discomfort (like making gagging sounds, struggling to speak), the appropriate response is to stop and check in.\n\nThe boyfriend grabbing her hair in a way that caused her neck to be awkward and her to be unable to communicate properly might be a red flag. Using hair as a rein in a sexual context can be a sensitive issue, as it's often depicted in certain porn scenarios where the woman might not be genuinely consenting. The fact that she immediately stopped and felt violated suggests that her boundaries were crossed, even if he didn't realize it at first.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is that he thought she was okay with it. The question is whether the onus is on the partner to communicate their discomfort more clearly or if the person engaging in the act should be more attuned to their partner's non-verbal cues. In healthy relationships, partners should be proactive in checking in and respecting each other's comfort levels without assuming.\n\nThe woman did try to communicate by making sounds, but they came out as gags because of the position. That's a legitimate barrier to clear communication. The boyfriend, instead of stopping when he noticed her discomfort, continued for two minutes and then got upset when she stopped. That doesn't seem to show proper consideration for her immediate response.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, the boyfriend likely went beyond her comfort zone without checking in, and she had a right to stop. However, the woman might have been able to communicate her discomfort more clearly before it escalated to that point. But given the situation, her response was immediate and necessary. The key is whether the boyfriend should have stopped when he noticed her reactions. If he didn't and proceeded, he's at fault. But the woman also has a responsibility to communicate her boundaries, maybe before the act starts. However, in the heat of the moment, things can escalate quickly, and partners should be attentive to cues.\n\nConsidering all that, the woman's immediate stop was appropriate. The boyfriend didn't respect her clear signs of discomfort. Therefore, the author (the woman) is not at fault. But wait, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she stopped immediately, which is her right, then she's not at fault. The boyfriend's actions were the issue. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
