Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 11-year relationship with her boyfriend. During a sexual encounter, he grabs her hair in a way that twists her head back, making her neck uncomfortable. She says she couldn't make clear sounds to stop and was gagging. She immediately pushed him off and felt disgusted and violated. He thought she was into it and didn't understand why she reacted that way. Now, he's hurt that she rejected him, and she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something new (grabbing her hair) without prior discussion. She felt it was painful and forced, leading her to stop the activity. The boyfriend believed she was enjoying it, which suggests a miscommunication. \n\nIn consensual sexual activity, both partners should be aware of each other's boundaries and comfort levels. If one partner introduces a new action that causes discomfort or pain without checking in, that's a problem. The author immediately stopped when she felt uncomfortable, which is a sign she respected her own boundaries. However, she didn't verbally communicate \"stop\" during the act, which her boyfriend might not have picked up on. \n\nBut wait, she mentioned that she was trying to signal stop through her sounds, but they came out as gags because of the position. So she couldn't effectively communicate verbally. In that case, stopping immediately after is a valid reaction. The boyfriend's failure to recognize her discomfort, especially since it was a new action, could be his fault for not checking in. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have communicated her discomfort earlier or that stopping abruptly might have caused the conflict. But given the situation where she was physically unable to express her distress clearly, pushing him away and stopping the activity seems reasonable. The boyfriend's assertion that he thought she was into it might be a sign of his own misreading of her cues, which can happen, especially in power dynamics like those in certain porn scenarios.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a mention of porn influencing expectations. The author points out that real reactions in porn don't reflect genuine consent. If the boyfriend was mimicking behaviors from porn without considering her comfort, that's an issue. The fact that he grabbed her hair in a way she found painful without prior discussion shows a lack of communication and respect for her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The boyfriend initiated a new, uncomfortable action without checking in, leading to her feeling violated. She acted to stop it when she could. The boyfriend's hurt feelings over being rejected come from not recognizing her discomfort. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity once she was uncomfortable. The boyfriend's actions were the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
