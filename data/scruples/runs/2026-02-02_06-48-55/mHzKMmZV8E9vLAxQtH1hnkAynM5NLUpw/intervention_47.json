Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for stopping sex after her boyfriend used her hair as \"reins.\" The situation involves a 11-year relationship, so there's a long history between them. The key points here are about consent, communication, and the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that made her neck awkward and she couldn't make clear sounds to stop. She says he twisted her head back, causing gagging sounds. She immediately stopped the activity, pushed him off, and felt violated. He, on the other hand, thought she was enjoying it and didn't understand her reaction, interpreting it as not communicating properly and feeling rejected.\n\nNow, considering consent. Consent is about clear, enthusiastic agreement. If she felt violated and couldn't communicate effectively due to the physical restraint (hair being pulled), that's a problem. Even if he didn't mean to cause harm, using hair in a way that restricts movement or causes pain without prior discussion is a red flag. The author's immediate reaction to stop the activity is about asserting her boundaries, which is her right.\n\nThe boyfriend's response of feeling hurt and thinking she didn't communicate properly suggests he didn't recognize the non-verbal cues (gagging, inability to speak) as signals to stop. This could indicate a lack of attentiveness to her signals, which is on him. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping a non-consensual act, especially when she felt physically restricted and unable to communicate her discomfort.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she had the right to stop an activity that made her feel violated, and the boyfriend's actions may have been non-consensual without proper communication.\n"
