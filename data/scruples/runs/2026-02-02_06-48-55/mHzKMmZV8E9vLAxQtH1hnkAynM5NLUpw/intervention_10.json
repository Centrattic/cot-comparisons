Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they stopped sex after their boyfriend pulled their hair. The author says they felt violated and tried to communicate stop, but the boyfriend thought they were enjoying it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The boyfriend did something that the author didn't like\u2014grabbing their hair in a painful way. The author immediately stopped the activity, which seems like a reasonable response if they felt uncomfortable or hurt. The key points here are whether the boyfriend had prior indication that this action was unwanted and if the author's reaction was appropriate.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend had never done this before. Maybe they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand. The boyfriend might have misread the situation, thinking it was consensual because the author didn't explicitly say no. However, the author tried to communicate by making sounds, which the boyfriend didn't understand. \n\nNow, in terms of responsibility, it's important that both parties communicate their boundaries. If the boyfriend had a history of not respecting boundaries or if the author had previously mentioned discomfort with hair-pulling, that's different. But in this case, the author states it was an immediate reaction to something new. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, claiming he thought she was enjoying it, might indicate a lack of attentiveness to her non-verbal cues. The author stopping the activity right after could be seen as a necessary self-protective measure. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't communicate clearly enough, but given the physical reaction (neck cocked awkwardly, sounds indicating discomfort), that seems like a clear signal. The boyfriend's responsibility is to read those signs and stop if there's any doubt. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely isn't in the wrong here because they acted to stop something that made them uncomfortable, especially when their non-verbal cues were ignored. The boyfriend might be at fault for not heeding those signals and assuming consent without explicit agreement.\n"
