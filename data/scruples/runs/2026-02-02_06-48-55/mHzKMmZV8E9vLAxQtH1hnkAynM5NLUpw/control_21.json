Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their boyfriend grabbing their hair during sex and using it as reins, which the author found painful and unpleasant, leading them to stop the encounter. The boyfriend thought she was into it, but she felt violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in sexual relationships. Consent is ongoing and can be revoked at any time. If the author felt pain and discomfort, they have the right to stop. The key here is whether the boyfriend respected her boundaries when she tried to communicate that she didn't like it.\n\nThe author mentions that when the\u7537\u53cb grabbed her hair, her neck was forced into an awkward position, and the sounds she made were attempts to say stop but came out as gags. She then pushed him off. It sounds like she was clearly signaling discomfort, even if she couldn't form words. In that case, the\u7537\u53cb's response was to think she was into it, which suggests he didn't recognize or respect her non-verbal cues.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was that she \"didn't communicate properly,\" implying the problem was on her side. However, in healthy relationships, partners should be attentive to each other's verbal and non-verbal cues. If someone is in pain or uncomfortable, it's the responsibility of the partner to stop immediately, not wait for explicit verbal consent. The author stopping the sex after experiencing pain is a valid response. The boyfriend's failure to recognize her distress and his hurt feelings over being rejected are not valid because the priority is her well-being.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the sex when she felt violated. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her boundaries and misinterpreting her signals. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
