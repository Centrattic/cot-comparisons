Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend used his partner's hair as \"reins\" during sex, leading to the partner stopping the activity immediately. The user is asking if the author (the partner who stopped) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The partner didn't like the physical action of hair pulling, which is a form of control. Even if the boyfriend didn't intend harm, using hair as reins can be seen as non-consensual if it wasn't discussed beforehand. The partner felt violated, which is a strong indicator of discomfort.\n\nThe author tried to communicate by pushing the boyfriend off and expressing disgust. The boyfriend's reaction was confusion and thinking it was about communication issues. But the key here is whether the action was consensual. Since it's a new act that wasn't previously agreed upon, the partner has the right to stop it. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is uncertain. However, in consensual relationships, both partners should respect boundaries. If the action wasn't discussed or agreed to, the boyfriend should have stopped when the partner showed discomfort. The author's reaction is valid as they are protecting their boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to stop any activity they find uncomfortable, especially when it's not consensual. The boyfriend needs to understand and respect that.\n"
