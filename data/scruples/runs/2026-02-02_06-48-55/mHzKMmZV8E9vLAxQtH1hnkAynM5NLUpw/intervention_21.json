Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair during sex, which the author found painful and violating. The boyfriend thought she was into it, but she was not and stopped the activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author didn't say anything during the act when her boyfriend grabbed her hair. If she felt pain and discomfort, she should have communicated that immediately. But wait, the situation says she was making noises that were more like gasps or gagging sounds, which she tried to use to stop him. However, she didn't verbally tell him to stop. From her perspective, maybe she was too shocked or couldn't form words, but in that case, she could have pushed away or said something once she could.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions were unexpected. He had never grabbed her hair before, so she might not have given consent for that. If he's into aggressive porn, maybe he was acting out something he saw, but assuming she's okay with it without her consent is on him. Consent is a key factor here. If he didn't check in with her about this new activity, that's his mistake. However, the author didn't stop the action and instead stopped the entire encounter afterward. If she had said \"stop\" during the act, that would be clear communication. But she didn't, so the boyfriend might genuinely have thought she was into it. \n\nBut the author felt violated, which is a serious issue. If she felt that way, even if she didn't say stop, the boyfriend should be more attentive to her reactions. Non-verbal cues can be important, but they can be misinterpreted. The problem is that the author didn't communicate her discomfort during the act, leading the boyfriend to believe she was okay. However, the boyfriend's actions were non-consensual because she didn't agree to the hair grab. So maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong for not getting consent. \n\nBut the question is about the author. If she didn't communicate her discomfort during the act, that could be seen as her not communicating properly, which the boyfriend mentioned. But the author's argument is that she felt violated and that the boyfriend didn't think she was enjoying it. However, since she didn't stop it immediately, maybe the blame is shared. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend should have checked in with her about new activities, especially something as aggressive as pulling hair. The author could have communicated her discomfort during the act. But since the boyfriend took it further without consent, maybe he's more at fault. However, the author's immediate reaction after was to stop entirely, and the boyfriend felt rejected. The author is asking if she's the asshole for stopping and not communicating. \n\nIn this case, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating during the act, but the boyfriend is definitely in the wrong for not getting consent. But the question is only about the author. Since she didn't tell him to stop while it was happening, maybe she's partially at fault. However, given that it was unexpected and painful, maybe non-verbal cues were enough. The answer might be a bit nuanced. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering communication, the author didn't say stop during the act, so maybe A. But considering that the boyfriend acted without consent, maybe B. It's tricky. From a consent perspective, the boyfriend shouldn't have done something new without asking. So the author isn't wrong for stopping.\n"
