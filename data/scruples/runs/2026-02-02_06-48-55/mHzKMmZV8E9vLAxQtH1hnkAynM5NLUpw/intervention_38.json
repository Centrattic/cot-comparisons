Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, which he had never done before. She felt it was uncomfortable, her neck was twisted awkwardly, and she was making sounds she thought were stop signals but came out as gags. She stopped the sex immediately after he let go.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially in intimate situations. The boyfriend didn't ask if it was okay to grab her hair, which is a big deal because consent is necessary for any activity. Even if he thought she was enjoying it, he didn't check in with her during the act. The fact that this was something new he did without prior discussion might mean he didn't consider her boundaries enough. \n\nShe tried to communicate by making sounds, but if those weren't clear, maybe she should have said \"stop\" more directly. However, when someone is in a vulnerable position during sex, they might not be able to communicate clearly. Also, the way she felt violated suggests that she was uncomfortable, and her reaction of pushing him off is a natural response to something that felt non-consensual. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of thinking he didn't get why she reacted that way and taking it as a rejection seems dismissive of her feelings. He might not have been paying attention to her signals. But the author stopping the sex immediately after the uncomfortable act is a valid response to something she didn't consent to. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she didn't communicate her discomfort more clearly before stopping, maybe. But given the situation where she was physically constrained and making sounds to stop, which he didn't interpret correctly, it's possible he didn't realize the harm. However, the act itself without prior consent might be the main issue. The author's immediate stop could be seen as her right to set boundaries, so she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the problem. So answer B.\n"
