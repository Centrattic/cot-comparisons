Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex, which she found painful and violating. She immediately stopped, and he thought she wasn't communicating properly.\n\nFirst, I need to assess consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before (grabbing her hair), causing physical discomfort and making her feel violated. She tried to signal stop by making sounds, but he didn't get it. He later thought she was rejecting him, but she felt he didn't think she was enjoying it.\n\nConsent is crucial. If the act was non-consensual or caused harm, the person doing it is at fault. The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her neck and made her feel like she couldn't communicate properly. She felt violated, which is a serious issue. The article mentions that he didn't realize she was in pain, but that doesn't excuse the action. The author stopping immediately is a valid response to feeling uncomfortable or hurt.\n\nThe boyfriend's response was to think she wasn't communicating well, which shifts blame onto her. But in such situations, the responsibility lies on him to check in and ensure she's comfortable. Since he didn't notice her distress and continued, he's at fault. The author's reaction is appropriate given the violation she experienced. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
