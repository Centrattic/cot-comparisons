Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing her hair during sex in a way that made her feel violated, and she stopped the activity immediately. Now, the boyfriend is upset and thinks she didn't communicate properly, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in intimate situations. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something (grabbing hair as reins) that the author had never done before. She felt it was aggressive and painful, leading her to stop. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thought she was okay with it and felt rejected when she stopped.\n\nIn consensual activities, especially in sexual contexts, all participants should have clear communication. If one partner does something outside the agreed-upon activities and the other feels it's non-consensual or harmful, stopping immediately is a valid response. The fact that the boyfriend didn't notice her discomfort or the signs to stop might indicate a lack of attentiveness. Also, using hair as reins is a specific act that can be painful, and if not previously discussed or agreed upon, it could be seen as non-consensual.\n\nThe author's immediate reaction to stop is a sign that she set a boundary. If the boyfriend continued for two minutes despite her non-verbal cues (gags, awkward sounds), that's a red flag. The boyfriend's response that he thought she was okay and taking it as rejection suggests he didn't properly read the signs or didn't respect her boundaries when she did stop.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is that he thought she was into it. But in consensual situations, it's the responsibility of all parties to check in and ensure comfort. Assuming consent without explicit communication can be a problem. The author's action of stopping is a clear communication, and the boyfriend's hurt feelings might be misplaced if he didn't respect her immediate reaction.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong because she stopped something that made her uncomfortable, and the boyfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping without proper communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
