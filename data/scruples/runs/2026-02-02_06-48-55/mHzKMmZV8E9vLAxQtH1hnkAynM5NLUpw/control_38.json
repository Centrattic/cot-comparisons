  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after stopping sex when her boyfriend used her hair as reins. She describes it as painful and awkward, with her neck twisting, making it hard to communicate. She tried to say stop but it came out as gags. After two minutes, she pushed him off and was disgusted. He claims he thought she was enjoying it, leading to a conflict where he felt rejected.\n\nFirst, consent is key in any sexual activity. The author felt violated and painful, which are red flags. Even if the boyfriend didn't realize the discomfort, the fact that she immediately stopped and expressed her feelings shows she wasn't into it. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling hurt because she \"didn't communicate properly\" seems dismissive of her experience. Using hair as reins can be aggressive, and the author's physical reaction (neck pain, awkward position) indicates it was uncomfortable. The fact that he continued for two minutes without checking in on her is problematic. The author's decision to stop was necessary for her well-being. So, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
