  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend of 11 years grabbed her hair as if using it like reins during sex, which she found painful and uncomfortable, and she stopped immediately. He thought she was enjoying it, but she felt violated and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are that the boyfriend did something he hadn't done before, which caused physical discomfort. The author tried to signal stop through sounds, but he didn't notice. She then pushed him off and felt disgusted. He feels hurt because he thought she was rejecting him.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication is crucial. Even in intimate settings, partners should be aware of each other's comfort levels. The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her neck and caused pain. The author's reaction was immediate and clear\u2014she tried to say stop but couldn't, then pushed him off. That seems like a legitimate response to being in pain and feeling violated.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he thought she was enjoying it might be a problem. It's his responsibility to check in with her and ensure she's comfortable. Relying on porn as a reference might have led to misinterpretation, but that's not an excuse. The fact that he didn't notice her distress signals and continued for two minutes suggests he wasn't attentive enough. \n\nThe author's decision to stop the activity was necessary for her well-being. Feeling violated is serious, and her reaction is valid. Blaming her for not communicating better might be dismissing her experience. He should have been more perceptive and responsive to her non-verbal cues.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend should have been more attentive and checked in with her, especially when trying something new. The answer should be B.\n"
