Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which caused her discomfort, and she stopped the activity. He thought she was okay with it, but she felt violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author mentioned that her boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that made her neck awkward and she couldn't make a sound, which she interpreted as a way to signal stop. She pushed him off and was disgusted. He, on the other hand, thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt when she rejected him.\n\nIn relationships, clear communication is key. The boyfriend has never done this before, so maybe he didn't realize it was uncomfortable. But the way he did it\u2014twisting her head back\u2014sounds aggressive. Even if he thought she was okay with it, if she clearly showed distress (like making gagging sounds and pushing him off), he should have stopped immediately. The fact that it lasted two minutes suggests he might not have noticed her discomfort. \n\nThe author stopping the sex after feeling violated is a valid reaction. She should not have to enjoy or tolerate something that makes her uncomfortable. Saying she's in the wrong would imply that her reaction is unjustified, but the situation seems to indicate that she had a right to feel violated. The boyfriend's argument that she didn't communicate properly is a bit of a red herring because her actions (pushing him and stopping) are forms of communication. \n\nAlso, using hair as reins, as mentioned, is something that can be problematic in real life versus porn. The author points out the difference between porn and reality, which is valid. So, the boyfriend's actions might have been influenced by porn, leading to a misunderstanding. However, the author's right to set boundaries and stop the activity is clear. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted within her right to stop something that made her uncomfortable, and the boyfriend should have recognized her distress and stopped earlier.\n"
