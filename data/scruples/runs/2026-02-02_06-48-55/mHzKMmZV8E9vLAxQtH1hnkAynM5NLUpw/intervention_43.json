Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after stopping sex when her boyfriend used her hair as \"reins.\" The situation involves a sudden act of aggression during sex that the author found painful and violating. She immediately stopped the interaction, feeling disgusted and violated. The boyfriend, however, claims he thought she enjoyed it and felt hurt by her reaction, interpreting it as poor communication and rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend grabbed her hair in a way that caused her physical discomfort, twisted her head back, and she couldn't make clear sounds to stop. She felt it was non-consensual and that he didn't think she was enjoying it. He, on the other hand, believed she was okay with it. The author's response was to push him off and stop the activity, which he took as rejection.\n\nIn terms of consent, it's crucial that all sexual activity is consensual and that communication is clear. If the author felt pain and discomfort, and her attempts to stop were not understood, that's a problem. The boyfriend's use of her hair as a means of control (using it as \"reins\") might be a power dynamic he's seen in porn, but real-life consent can't be assumed from that. The fact that she had to stop immediately suggests that her boundaries were crossed. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of hurt feelings and blaming her for not communicating properly is problematic. Healthy sexual relationships require active consent and the ability to stop at any time without guilt. If the partner doesn't respect the immediate stop, that's a red flag. The author's right to feel violated is valid if the act was non-consensual. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity when she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend's actions and his subsequent response indicate a failure to understand consent and her boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
