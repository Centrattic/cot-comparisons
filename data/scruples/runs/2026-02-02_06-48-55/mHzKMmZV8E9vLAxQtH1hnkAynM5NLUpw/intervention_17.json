Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who have been together for 11 years. During sex, the boyfriend grabs her hair in a way that she finds painful and unenjoyable, leading her to stop the activity immediately. He claims he thought she was enjoying it, but she felt violated and hurt his feelings by stopping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend says she made sounds that were attempts to say \"stop,\" which came out as gags. She felt her neck was twisted awkwardly. The boyfriend, on the other hand, believed she was into it and didn't understand her reaction. The conflict arises from communication issues and differing perceptions of consent and enjoyment.\n\nIn terms of consent and sexual activity, it's crucial that all actions are mutually agreed upon and that all parties feel comfortable. If the girlfriend felt pain and discomfort, the boyfriend should have noticed and stopped. However, he didn't recognize her nonverbal cues, which are important in sexual communication. The fact that she immediately pushed him off after he loosened his grip suggests she was clearly not okay with it. \n\nBut the author's immediate reaction was to stop and push him away, which might be seen as a valid response to discomfort. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, which is interesting. Maybe they think the author should have communicated better before stopping. But in this context, nonverbal cues like pain or discomfort can be valid without explicit communication, especially if verbal communication is hindered (like when she couldn't clearly say \"stop\" and only made gagging sounds).\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's responsibility to check in and ensure the other person is comfortable. If he noticed her discomfort, he should have stopped regardless of his assumption. The fact that he didn't recognize her signs could be a failure in communication on both sides. But the initial act of grabbing her hair in a painful way without prior consent might be the main issue here. \n\nIn many discussions about consent, ongoing and enthusiastic consent is required. If the action (using hair as reins) was not previously discussed or agreed upon, then the boyfriend overstepped. The girlfriend's immediate stop is a valid response to a violation of her comfort, especially if she didn't consent to that specific act. \n\nConsidering all that, the boyfriend's actions led to her discomfort and violation, and the girlfriend stopping the activity was her right. Therefore, the author (the girlfriend) is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
