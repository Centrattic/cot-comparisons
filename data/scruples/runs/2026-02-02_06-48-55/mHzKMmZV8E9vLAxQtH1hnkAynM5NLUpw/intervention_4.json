Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after stopping sex because her boyfriend used her hair as reins during the act.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author and her boyfriend have been together for 11 years. During their sexual activity, he grabbed her hair in a way that twisted her head back, making it hard to move or speak. She felt violated and immediately stopped the interaction. He, on the other hand, thought she was enjoying it and didn't understand her reaction. Now, she's questioning if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend did something he had never done before, which caused discomfort and potentially pain. The author felt violated and stopped the activity. The boyfriend claims he thought she was okay with it, leading to a conflict about communication and consent.\n\nI should consider the concept of consent here. Consent is ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time. If the author felt uncomfortable and stopped the activity, that's her right. However, the question is whether she was wrong in doing so. The boyfriend's action might be seen as a boundary not discussed, so using hair as reins in a way that causes physical discomfort without prior agreement could be a problem. But the author could have communicated her discomfort during the act, especially since it's a new behavior. However, she might not have had the chance to do so because of the physical restraint.\n\nHer reaction is immediate and based on her feelings of violation. He didn't realize she was uncomfortable, which points to a communication issue. But the responsibility isn't entirely on her to communicate if the action is non-consensual to begin with. Wait, but if he had never done it before, maybe he assumed she was okay with it? But that's a risky assumption. Consent should be explicit, not assumed.\n\nIn many discussions about sexual activity, it's emphasized that partners should check in with each other and be aware of each other's comfort levels. If he grabbed her hair in a way that caused her physical discomfort and she couldn't make sounds, that's a sign of possible coercion or non-consensual action. Her stopping it was a valid response to protect herself. The boyfriend's claim that he thought she was enjoying it might indicate a lack of awareness or empathy towards her signals.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, the boyfriend's action might be the main issue here. However, the author could have tried to express her discomfort earlier. But given the situation where she was physically constrained, it's understandable she couldn't. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault for stopping the activity. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and her reaction was justified. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
