Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they stopped sex after their boyfriend grabbed their hair in a way that felt aggressive. The boyfriend didn't realize it was painful until after the fact and thinks the author didn't communicate properly.\n\nFirst, the key points: the boyfriend grabbed the author's hair, twisted their head back, causing discomfort. The author tried to say stop but couldn't make clear sounds. They felt violated and pushed him away. The boyfriend thought she was enjoying it and felt hurt when she stopped.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication. Consent is about clear, enthusiastic agreement. If the author felt pain and tried to stop, that's a clear sign of non-consent. The boyfriend's action was unexpected and aggressive, not something they had discussed before. Even if he thought she was into it, her physical reactions (painful sounds, neck position) should have been red flags. The fact that he didn't notice these signs and instead blamed her for not communicating properly is problematic. He has a responsibility to check in and ensure she's comfortable. The author acted to stop something that was clearly uncomfortable, so she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend should have been more attentive and stopped when she showed distress. So the answer is B.\n"
