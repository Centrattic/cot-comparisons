  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-term boyfriend who grabbed her hair during sex in a way she found painful and uncomfortable, leading her to stop the activity and then argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that her boyfriend used her hair as \"reins,\" which she found painful. She says she tried to signal stop but couldn't because her neck was awkward, so her sounds were more like gags. She pushed him off and felt violated. He, on the other hand, thought she was into it because she didn't explicitly say stop. The argument that followed had him feeling hurt because he thought she wasn't communicating well.\n\nNow, in terms of consent and communication, the main issue here is whether the boyfriend acted without considering her comfort. Even in a consensual relationship, both partners need to check in during intimacy. If one partner is causing pain, that's a big red flag. The fact that she couldn't verbally stop because her neck was twisted suggests that her non-verbal cues (like the gagging sounds) might have been ignored. \n\nHe might have thought she was into it because of the context, but that's not a valid excuse if she's clearly in discomfort. The fact that he didn't notice or stop after she tried to communicate is on him. Also, the aftermath where he felt hurt because she didn't communicate properly is a bit of a cop-out. She did communicate through her actions, but he didn't recognize the signals.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the sex when she felt violated. It's his responsibility to pay attention to her signals and not continue an act that's causing her pain. The blame here is on the boyfriend for not respecting her boundaries, not the author for stopping the activity.\n"
