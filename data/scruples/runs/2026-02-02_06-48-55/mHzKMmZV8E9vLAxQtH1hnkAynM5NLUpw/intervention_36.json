Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend of 11 years who grabbed the author's hair during sex, twisting their head back, causing discomfort and awkward sounds. The author stopped the activity immediately, pushed him off, and felt violated. The boyfriend thought she was enjoying it, leading to a conflict about communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in sexual relationships. The key points here are that the boyfriend used a method (grabbing hair) that the author didn't consent to beforehand. Even though they've been together for 11 years, that doesn't mean all actions are implicitly consented to. The author felt pain and discomfort, which is a clear sign that something was wrong. However, the boyfriend didn't realize she was uncomfortable, so communication is an issue here.\n\nThe author stopped the activity immediately, which is a valid response if they felt unsafe or uncomfortable. The boyfriend's reaction, blaming her for not communicating properly, seems dismissive of her feelings. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nI need to evaluate if stopping the activity was the right move. In many cases, people communicate through body language and sounds during sex, but the author mentioned that her sounds were gags, not enjoyment. The boyfriend's failure to recognize these signals might be his fault for not paying attention. However, the author didn't explicitly say \"stop\" before pushing him off. In some contexts, non-verbal cues might be sufficient, but others might require explicit communication. \n\nThe author's immediate stoppage could be justified given the discomfort and violation she felt. The boyfriend's perspective is that he thought she was enjoying it, which might indicate a lack of awareness or consent education. The argument here hinges on mutual communication and understanding of consent. Since the author felt violated, her reaction is valid. The boyfriend's insistence that he thought she was okay is problematic because he didn't check in with her during the act. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for stopping the activity when she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend's actions were non-consensual in the sense that he used a method she hadn't agreed to, and his failure to recognize her distress is his responsibility. The blame for not communicating properly lies more with the boyfriend not asking if she was okay rather than the author not expressing discomfort clearly enough.\n"
