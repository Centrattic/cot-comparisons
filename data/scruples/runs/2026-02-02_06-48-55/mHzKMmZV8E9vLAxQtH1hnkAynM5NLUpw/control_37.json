Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that her boyfriend, after 11 years, grabbed her hair during sex in a way that felt aggressive and caused her physical discomfort. She immediately stopped the activity and pushed him off, feeling violated. He claims he thought she was enjoying it and took her reaction as poor communication and rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key here is that the author felt violated and had to stop the act. She tried to communicate by making sounds, which he didn't understand. The boyfriend didn't realize she was in pain or wanted to stop, which suggests he wasn't paying attention to her non-verbal cues. In healthy relationships, both partners should be attuned to each other's comfort levels. If one person is causing physical discomfort or pain, that's a red flag. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He didn't get why she reacted that way and felt hurt, implying he didn't consider her discomfort. The fact that he used hair as leverage, which he hadn't done before, might be influenced by porn scenarios, but that's not an excuse. The author stopping the activity immediately when she felt uncomfortable is a valid response. \n\nCommunication is two-way. While the author could have perhaps verbalized her discomfort more clearly, the boyfriend's failure to recognize her distress and his subsequent defensiveness shift the blame onto him. The author's actions to stop the activity were necessary for her well-being, so she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and misinterpreting her signals. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
