Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which caused her physical discomfort and she felt violated. She immediately stopped the activity, but he didn't understand why she reacted that way and thought she wasn't communicating properly. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in intimate relationships. The key point here is that the author felt physically uncomfortable and stopped the activity. She felt violated, which is a strong indicator that the action crossed a boundary. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't realize she was uncomfortable and thought she was enjoying it. \n\nIn consensual sex, both partners should be aware of each other's comfort levels. If someone is in pain or uncomfortable, the other partner should stop immediately. However, the author stopped the activity as soon as it happened, which is appropriate. The boyfriend's response was to feel hurt and believe it was a communication issue, which might suggest he didn't take her distress seriously.\n\nThe fact that he used her hair as \"reins\" is a form of physical control that can be non-consensual if not discussed beforehand. Even if the author didn't explicitly say no, her physical reactions (like trying to say stop and feeling violated) should be clear signs. The author stopping immediately is a valid response to discomfort, not a rejection of him personally. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was wrong, but based on these points, it seems like the boyfriend is the one who acted inappropriately by not respecting her boundaries. The author's actions were about stopping something that made her uncomfortable, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
