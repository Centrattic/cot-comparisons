Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they stopped sex because their boyfriend used their hair as reins. The boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it, while she felt violated and says he didn't realize she was trying to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. In any sexual activity, consent must be ongoing and clear. If the person is experiencing pain or discomfort and their partner isn't recognizing non-verbal cues, that's a problem. The author says she tried to say stop but couldn't make clear sounds, which might indicate she was in a position where she couldn't communicate effectively. That's concerning because consent can't be given if someone is unable to communicate their refusal.\n\nHer boyfriend grabbing her hair and twisting her head back sounds aggressive and possibly non-consensual. Even if he didn't intend harm, the act itself could be causing physical distress. The fact that she felt violated suggests that her boundaries were crossed, which is a serious issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it. This might point to a communication gap. However, the responsibility for clear communication in such situations is not solely on the person who is in discomfort. Partners should be attuned to each other's signals and check in regularly. If she was making gagging sounds and uncomfortable noises, he should have noticed and stopped immediately. \n\nThe author stopping the act immediately after feeling violated is a reasonable response. She felt her boundaries were violated, so stopping is appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling hurt because she rejected him shows that he didn't take her feelings into account. \n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend's actions led to her feeling violated, and her response was justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
