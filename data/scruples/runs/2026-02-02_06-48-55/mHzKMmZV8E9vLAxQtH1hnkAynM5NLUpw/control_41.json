Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with 11 years together. The boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex, using it as reins, which she found painful and uncomfortable. She immediately stopped the activity, but he thought she was into it and felt hurt. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is consent and communication. The woman felt violated and had to stop the act, which is her right. The boyfriend's action of grabbing her hair was new and caused her physical discomfort. She tried to communicate by making sounds, but he didn't realize she wanted to stop. He then blamed her for not communicating properly.\n\nIn consensual sexual activity, all parties must have clear, enthusiastic consent. If she wasn't comfortable with a specific act (hair grabbing), and she communicated her discomfort, even if it was non-verbally, it's the partner's responsibility to recognize and stop. However, in this case, he didn't recognize her signals and continued, leading to her stopping abruptly. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to blame her for not communicating is problematic. It shifts the responsibility from him not noticing her discomfort to her not expressing it clearly enough. In healthy relationships, communication is a two-way street. Partners should be attentive to each other's cues. If the man was truly paying attention, he should have noticed her distress without needing explicit words. \n\nMoreover, the fact that this behavior was new to him adds another layer. It's possible he was influenced by porn, which doesn't accurately reflect real consent. As the user mentioned, porn can mislead people about what is consensual and enjoyable. The woman's reaction is valid because she wasn't comfortable with the act, and her stopping it is not wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's feelings being hurt because she didn't continue is less important compared to her autonomy and comfort. Prioritizing emotional comfort over physical safety and consent is a red flag. The woman's immediate stop was a necessary action to protect herself from further discomfort or violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author (the woman) is not in the wrong. She had the right to stop the activity when she felt uncomfortable. The boyfriend's failure to recognize her signals and his subsequent blame on her for not communicating properly is the issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
