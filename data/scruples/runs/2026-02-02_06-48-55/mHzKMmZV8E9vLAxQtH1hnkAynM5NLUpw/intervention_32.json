Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend grabbing the author's hair during sex, which she found painful and violating, and she stopped immediately. The boyfriend thought she was into it, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says her boyfriend did something he never did before\u2014grabbed her hair and twisted her head back, causing her to make gagging sounds. She felt violated and stopped the activity. He, on the other hand, thought she was into it and felt hurt when she rejected him.\n\nCommunication is a big part of consensual sex. The boyfriend introduced a new action without prior discussion. If he didn't check in with her during the act, that's a problem. The author tried to communicate by making sounds, but he didn't recognize them as signals to stop. She then physically pushed him off, which is a clear stop signal. \n\nIn many relationships, consent is ongoing and requires active communication. If one partner is doing something that causes discomfort, the other should be attentive and responsive. The boyfriend's failure to notice her discomfort and his assumption that she was into it could indicate a lack of awareness or respect for her boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author did stop the interaction immediately upon feeling violated. She didn't continue, so she isn't at fault for not addressing it later. The boyfriend's hurt feelings stem from not understanding her reaction, which is his responsibility to address through better communication and understanding consent cues.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to a violation, and she took immediate steps to stop it. The boyfriend is at fault for not recognizing her discomfort and proceeding without considering her boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
