Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-term boyfriend who, during sex, grabs the author's hair in a way that causes discomfort and pain. The author stops the activity immediately and is upset, feeling violated, while the boyfriend claims he thought she was enjoying it and is hurt that she didn't communicate her discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The main issue is consent and communication during intimate activities. The boyfriend's action of grabbing the hair was new and caused physical discomfort, leading the author to feel violated. The boyfriend's reaction is that he thought she was into it and is upset about her not communicating her feelings.\n\nIn terms of consent, it's crucial that all activities during intimacy are consensual and that all parties are comfortable. The boyfriend's action was a change from their usual behavior, and the author didn't express her discomfort during the act, which he might not have picked up on. However, in such situations, the responsibility isn't solely on the person experiencing discomfort to communicate every single moment. Partners should be attuned to each other's reactions and cues. The fact that the author felt she couldn't make a sound and was gasping for air suggests her distress wasn't obvious to him, but he should have noticed her physical reactions and stopped.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he thought she was enjoying it might be a case of him misreading the situation, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He initiated an action that caused harm, and even if he thought it was consensual, the actual result was her feeling violated. The author's immediate stop and pushing him off is a clear signal of her discomfort. \n\nIn terms of communication, while the author didn't explicitly say \"stop\" during the act, the physical reactions and the aftermath communication were there. The boyfriend's hurt feelings about being rejected might be valid, but the primary issue is his action causing pain. The responsibility here is on the boyfriend to ensure that his partner is comfortable and to heed her signals. The author's actions after the fact (pushing him off and expressing disgust) are valid responses to being physically hurt and feeling violated.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the problem, and the author's response was appropriate given the situation. The key points are the lack of prior communication about hair pulling, the physical discomfort caused, and the boyfriend's failure to recognize her distress signals. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
