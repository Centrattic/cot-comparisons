  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for immediately stopping sex after my boyfriend of 11 years lets go of my hair that he has decided would be good to use as reins?\nWe all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who've been together for 11 years. The boyfriend grabbed her hair during sex and used it like reins, which she found uncomfortable and painful. She stopped the act immediately, but he thought she was into it and felt hurt because she didn't continue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze consent and communication during sexual activity. Consent is an ongoing process, and any time a new action is introduced, it's important to check in. The boyfriend introduced a new action (grabbing hair) without prior discussion. The woman felt pain and discomfort, which she tried to communicate by making sounds, but it wasn't clear to him. She stopped the activity right after, which is her right.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he didn't recognize her discomfort. The woman felt violated and disgusted. Since she immediately stopped and he didn't notice, maybe he wasn't attentive to her non-verbal cues. In that case, the fault isn't hers for stopping. She has the right to set boundaries and stop at any time. The boyfriend's hurt feelings might be his own issue, but the main point is that she didn't want to continue. So she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
