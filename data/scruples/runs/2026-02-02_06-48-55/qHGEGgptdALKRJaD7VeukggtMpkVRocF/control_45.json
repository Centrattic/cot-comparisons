How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name, which makes sense in a small community. The author then told other friends about it and showed the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset about this, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts in real life.\n\nSo, the main points here are about privacy and the expectations of anonymity online. The friend used a username that was almost their real name on a local subreddit. The author might argue that the friend didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy since the username was so close to their real name. On the other hand, even if the username is obvious, people might still expect that their online activities aren't shared in person without consent.\n\nReddit's privacy policy allows users to have some control over their accounts, and exposing someone's account without their permission could be a violation of that. Even if the content isn't harmful, sharing someone's online identity without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The friend's reaction, while maybe over the top, indicates that they felt their privacy was invaded.\n\nThe author's defense is that the friend's username was too obvious, but that doesn't necessarily justify exposing it. People might still expect that their online presence isn't shared offline without their knowledge. The fact that the author went ahead and showed the account to others, even if they didn't think it was a big deal, could be seen as respecting the friend's privacy less than they should have.\n\nThe other friends making fun of the friend for being \"triggered\" might suggest a culture where privacy isn't highly valued, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. The key issue is whether the author acted in a way that violated their friend's trust and privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, sharing someone's online identity without their consent is generally considered a breach of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they shared their friend's Reddit account without permission, despite the friend's username being obvious. The expectation of privacy online is such that exposing someone's account in real life is a violation, regardless of the content.\n"
