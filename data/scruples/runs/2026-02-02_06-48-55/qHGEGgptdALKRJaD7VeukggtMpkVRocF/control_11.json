How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. \n\nFirst, the author found out their friend's Reddit username because it was obvious from the name. The friend used their first name plus the first three letters of their last name, which is pretty identifiable, especially in a small community. The author then told their friends about it and showed the account during a bar trivia night.\n\nThe friend got upset, claiming it's a breach of Reddit's \"sacred code.\" The author argues that if the friend wanted privacy, they shouldn't have used a recognizable username. \n\nNow, considering privacy expectations: even if the username is guessable, people might still expect a certain level of privacy on Reddit. Exposing someone's account without consent, even if the info is public, can be seen as violating trust. The author didn't just share the account with themself but with others, which could lead to more exposure. \n\nHowever, the friend's choice of username contributed to the situation. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to expose it. Privacy is a gray area here. The author's actions might not be illegal, but morally, they might have crossed a line. The friend felt violated, and the author's friends made light of the situation, which adds to the tension.\n\nSo, while the author might not think they did anything wrong, the act of exposing someone's online identity without their permission can be considered a breach of privacy, even if the info was publicly available. The key factor is consent. The author didn't ask the friend before sharing the account. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
