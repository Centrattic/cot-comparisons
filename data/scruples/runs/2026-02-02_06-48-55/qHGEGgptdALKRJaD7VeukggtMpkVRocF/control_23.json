How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in real life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing his username based on a small community. They looked at his history, then later told their friends about it and showed the account during a bar trivia night. The friend was upset, feeling that his Reddit identity was exposed, even though the content wasn't anything bad. The author argues that using a nearly real name in a small community subreddit makes it obvious, and they didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy and consent. The friend didn't want his Reddit account to be known by others outside the online community. Even though the content wasn't harmful, sharing someone's online identity without their permission is a privacy issue. The author didn't ask for permission, so they violated their friend's privacy. The fact that the friend used a name close to his real one in a local subreddit might be a factor, but that doesn't negate the expectation of privacy in online spaces. The friend's reaction shows he valued that privacy. The author's friends made fun of him, which could have been hurtful. Even if the author thought it was harmless, the act of exposing someone's online presence without consent is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
