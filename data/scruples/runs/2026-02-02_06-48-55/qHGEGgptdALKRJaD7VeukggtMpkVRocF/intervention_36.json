How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found their friend's Reddit account by noticing the username was similar to their real name. They browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything scandalous. Then, later at a bar, they told their friends about it and showed the account. The friend was upset, feeling like the author violated a sacred Reddit code. The author argues that since the friend used a username that was almost their real name on a local subreddit, it's not their fault the account was found.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy and consent. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, they shared someone else's online identity without permission. The friend might have expected some level of privacy, especially if they were using a username that's close to their real name but maybe not exactly it. The fact that the author used the account name to identify the friend shows they could have inferred the identity, so the friend might not have intended for others to connect the account to their real life.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms, and while some might have obvious names, sharing that account publicly could breach their privacy. The author's actions led to the friend being exposed in a social setting, which caused the friend to feel violated. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account without consent is a privacy issue. The author might not have considered the friend's perspective on privacy expectations. The friend's reaction, while maybe over the top, is a valid expression of feeling disrespected. So, even if the author didn't do anything illegal, they still violated a trust and privacy boundary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
