How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in person. The backstory is that the friend used a username that's almost obvious given the small community, and the author found their account, then shared it with mutual friends during a trivia night. The friend got upset, and the author is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's Reddit account was using their first name and the first three letters of their last name in a small community subreddit. The author found it and later told their other friends. The friend was upset, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nKey points here: The friend's Reddit presence was private, even if the username was easy to guess. By exposing it, the author potentially breached that privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of revealing someone's online identity without consent can be a violation. The author might have thought it's not a big deal, but the friend's reaction suggests otherwise. Also, the friends in the bar made fun of the friend for being triggered, which adds to the social pressure.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. So I should analyze whether the action crossed a privacy line. Reddit allows pseudonymity, and users typically don't expect their usernames to be linked to their real identities unless they explicitly use their real names. The author's friend might have wanted to keep their Reddit activity separate from their real-life persona. Even if the username was obvious, the author didn't ask for permission before exposing it. Sharing it with others could lead to unwanted attention or exposure of the friend's online habits, which they might not want their real-life friends to see.\n\nThe author's justification is that the username was obvious and the content wasn't embarrassing. But that's not the point. The friend might have wanted to maintain a boundary between their online and offline life. The act of exposing the account, regardless of the content, could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the other friends taking it as a joke doesn't mitigate the harm done to the friend who was upset. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't intend any harm, the action was a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
