How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends in real life. The backstory is that the author discovered their friend's Reddit account because the username was clearly identifiable with their real name. The friend was using a subreddit for their local community, and the username was almost his full name. The author then told the story to their friends and showed them the account, which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend used a username that's almost his real name in a local subreddit. The author found this out by themselves, then told others and showed them the account. The friend felt this was a breach of a \"sacred Reddit code\" about not exposing online personas in real life.\n\nNow, thinking about privacy. Even if the username is almost the real name, does that mean it's okay to expose it? The friend might have expected some level of anonymity, even if it's not perfect. Reddit users often assume that their online activity, even with identifiable usernames, is separate from their IRL lives. So, even if the username is obvious, sharing it with others could violate that privacy. The friend's reaction suggests he didn't want his online presence to be shared in real life, regardless of how obvious the username is.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that since the username is so obvious, it's not a big deal. But that's not considering the friend's feelings and expectations. The friend might have chosen a username that's a bit anonymous, even if it's almost their real name, for the sake of the subreddit community. By exposing that, the author might have breached that unspoken agreement or expectation of privacy.\n\nAnother angle: the author browsed the friend's history themselves first. That's a bit of a privacy breach on its own, though maybe minor. Then, sharing that info with others could escalate the issue. The friends who were with them made fun of the friend for being upset, which might indicate that the author wasn't fully aware of the implications of their actions.\n\nReddit's community norms: There's an understanding that people might use pseudonyms or modified names for their accounts. Even if the name is almost real, the platform is meant to have some separation between online identities and real life. By revealing the account to others, the author is merging those two, which the friend found problematic.\n\nSo, even though the username was obvious, the act of exposing it to others in real life could be considered a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction is valid because he expected his online presence to remain in the online realm. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings or the social norms of Reddit, so they might be in the wrong here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated their friend's expectation of privacy, even if the username was somewhat obvious.\n"
