How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends.\n\nSo, the backstory is that the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was clearly identifiable. They didn't do anything harmful, just shared the account with others at a bar. The friend got upset, thinking it's a violation of some Reddit \"sacred code.\" The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used an obvious username.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy and consent. The friend didn't want their Reddit activity to be known by others, and the author shared it without permission. Even if the username was obvious, the act of exposing it and showing others could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut the author might counter that the friend was careless with their username. However, the principle is that sharing someone's online identity without their consent, even if it's public information, can still be a privacy issue. The friend's reaction suggests they valued their Reddit identity as private, and the author crossed that line by exposing it. \n\nEven if the content wasn't harmful, the act of revealing the account in a social setting where others might now know could lead to discomfort. The author's friends laughed at the friend's reaction, implying the friend might feel embarrassed or violated. \n\nTherefore, while the author might not have malicious intent, they did act without considering their friend's privacy expectations. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
