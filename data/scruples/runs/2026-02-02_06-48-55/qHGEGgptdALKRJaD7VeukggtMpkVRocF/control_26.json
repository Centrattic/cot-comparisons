How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. So, the situation is that the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obviously the friend's name, like first name plus first three letters of the last name. Then, when they met up with friends, the author told them about this and showed the account. The friend was upset, thinking it's a breach of some Reddit \"sacred code.\" The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key factors are the expectation of privacy, how the account was discovered, and the action of sharing it. The friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community subreddit, which made it easy to identify. The author didn't do anything like hacking or asking for the password; they just recognized the username. Then, the author shared the account with friends in person. \n\nNow, privacy on Reddit: Reddit is a public platform, but users often assume a certain level of anonymity, especially with usernames. If someone uses a username that's easy to connect to their real identity, maybe they're not taking full precautions. But does that mean others are justified in exposing it? The author didn't steal the account or do anything malicious, just shared the account name. But the friend felt their privacy was breached. \n\nThe author argues that the friend should have been more careful with their username. That might be a valid point, but does that absolve the author? Even if the account is somewhat public, sharing someone's username with others, especially if they didn't want it known, could be considered a breach of trust. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their online privacy, even if their username wasn't perfectly anonymized. \n\nAlso, the context matters. The account was shown to friends, and the friend was embarrassed. The author thought it was harmless, but the friend felt it was a violation. The other friends laughed it off, but that doesn't mean the action was right. \n\nIn such cases, the key is whether the author acted with intent to harm or if they were just being careless. The author didn't seem to think it was a big deal, but they did expose their friend's account. Even if the friend's username was guessable, the act of sharing it could be seen as violating their privacy, especially without permission. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the expectation of privacy was reasonable. The friend used a semi-anonymous username in a small community, so maybe they expected some level of anonymity. The author, knowing the friend, could have reasonably known that sharing the account would affect that privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they shared the account without considering the friend's privacy, even if the friend wasn't perfectly anonymous.\n"
