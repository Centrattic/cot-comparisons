How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found their friend's Reddit account, which had an obvious username, and then told the story to their friends at a bar. The friend got upset, but the others didn't find it a big deal. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the friend used a username that was almost their full name. In a small community, that's not exactly private. The author didn't actively out or expose the friend, they just shared the story. But maybe the friend didn't want his Reddit activity to be known in real life. The author might have violated that privacy, even if the username was obvious. \n\nReddit is a platform where people often use pseudonyms, and the culture does value anonymity. So even if the friend's username was guessable, the act of exposing that they have a Reddit account and that they use a certain username might be considered a breach of that unspoken rule. The author might have done something that the friend considered a privacy violation, even if the content wasn't harmful. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests they felt their privacy was invaded. The author's defense is that the username was obvious, but that doesn't necessarily mean the friend was okay with others seeing their activity there. Maybe the friend thought that using a near-real name in a local subreddit was a risk they were willing to take, but didn't expect someone to actually find and share it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. It was a bit of curiosity and a story shared in a casual setting. The content wasn't embarrassing, just sports-related. The others didn't mind, which might indicate that in their group, this isn't a huge issue. However, the key here is that the author didn't get consent before sharing this. Even if it's a trivial matter to some, the friend felt it was a problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by exposing their friend's account without permission. Privacy breaches can be subjective, but since the friend was upset, the author might be at fault for not respecting that boundary. The answer could be A (they're in the wrong) because they shared a personal detail without consent, even if it's a public platform. The friend's username was public info, but using it to expose their online presence to others might be a violation of trust. \n\nAlternatively, since the info was publicly accessible, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the friend's reaction is important. The author might have been unaware of the friend's desire for privacy, but once they exposed it and the friend was upset, they should have been more considerate. The line between harmless sharing and privacy violation can be thin here. \n\nConsidering all that, the author probably is in the wrong. They shouldn't have shared the friend's Reddit account information without asking. Even if the content wasn't bad, it's about respecting the friend's privacy and boundaries. The answer is A.\n"
