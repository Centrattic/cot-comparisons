How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was almost their full name. Then, when they met up with friends, the author told them and showed the account. The friend was upset about it. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friend used a username that was his real name plus part of his last name, which made it easy to identify him. The author didn't think it was a big deal because the friend wasn't posting anything embarrassing. The friend, however, felt that exposing his Reddit account violated some kind of \"sacred Reddit code,\" which the author didn't know about.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's username made his identity somewhat public. If he used a pseudonym, maybe the situation would be different. But since he used a name that's almost his real one, maybe he didn't expect complete anonymity. However, Reddit is a platform where people often use pseudonyms to keep their online activities separate from their real lives. Even if the username is a real name, maybe the friend still expected some level of privacy.\n\nThen there's the act of exposing the account to others. Even if the account isn't posting anything bad, sharing someone's personal online presence without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might think they're being honest or just having fun, but the friend felt it was a violation. The key here is consent. The author didn't ask before sharing the account, so the friend's privacy was intruded upon, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe argument that the friend shouldn't have used a real-ish username is a bit of a \"they had it coming\" reasoning. Just because someone made their identity somewhat public doesn't mean they're okay with others exposing that information. People might have different comfort levels. Also, the fact that they live in a small community might make the username less anonymous than intended.\n\nThe author tried to justify it by saying they didn't think it was a big deal because the content wasn't bad. But the issue isn't about the content but the act of revealing the account without permission. Privacy is about control over one's information. The author took away the friend's control by sharing the account with others.\n\nThe friend's reaction, while maybe over the top, is still valid because it's about his personal boundaries. The author's actions, even if well-meaning, cross into violating those boundaries. The other friends making fun of the friend for being triggered might indicate that the author's side is more in the majority, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the right. It's about respecting others' feelings and privacy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they shared a friend's personal account without consent, which invaded the friend's privacy, even if the account wasn't entirely anonymous. The key factor is the lack of permission and the breach of trust.\n"
