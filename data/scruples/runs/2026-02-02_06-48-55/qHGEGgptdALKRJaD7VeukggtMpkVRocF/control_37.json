How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given story is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in person. The situation involves the author figuring out their friend's Reddit username, then later showing it to mutual friends at a bar, which upset the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend used a username that's almost their real name (first name plus three letters of the last name) on a local subreddit. The author found out and later shared the account with friends. The friend was upset, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life.\n\nSo, the main question is about privacy and consent. The friend might have expected their Reddit presence to remain online, especially since usernames can be private. Even if the username was obvious, sharing it without permission could be a breach of trust. The author argues that the friend should have used a more anonymous name, but that's a bit of the \"it's their fault\" line. However, just because someone uses a semi-identifiable username doesn't necessarily mean they want their identity shared with others. People might assume a certain level of anonymity even with identifiable usernames, especially when it's a small community.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author shared the account in a group setting, which could be embarrassing for the friend, even if the content wasn't harmful. The friends laughed at the friend's reaction, which might add to the tension. The author might not have realized the importance their friend placed on keeping online identities separate from real life.\n\nReddit's culture does emphasize anonymity, so exposing someone's account could be seen as violating that. The friend's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is valid because their privacy was breached. The author might have thought it's not a big deal, but the friend's discomfort shows that it was.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the information was easy to figure out, sharing it without consent is generally wrong. The author had no right to disclose the friend's Reddit identity to others, regardless of how obvious the username was. The friend had the right to keep their online activities private, even if their username wasn't completely anonymous.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author did do something that breached their friend's privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account without permission is a violation. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
