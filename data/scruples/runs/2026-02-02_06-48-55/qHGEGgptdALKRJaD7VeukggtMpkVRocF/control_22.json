How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious, like the first name and first three letters of the last name. They looked through the history and then later shared the account with friends during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" was broken. The author thinks it's not a big deal since the friend's posts aren't harmful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's consider privacy. Even if the username is a bit obvious, sharing someone's online account without permission could be a privacy issue. The friend might have expected that their Reddit activity is private, even if the username is recognizable. The author might have breached that trust by showing others the account.\n\nAlso, the friend was upset and called it a violation of a \"secret code,\" which Reddit users might take seriously as a community norm. The author's defense that the friend used an obvious username might not justify the exposure. Privacy is about respecting someone's wishes, not just the technical possibility of being discovered.\n\nThe author also egged on by others, but that doesn't make it right. The main issue here is respecting boundaries. Even if the content isn't embarrassing, sharing someone's account without consent is a violation of privacy. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's expectation of privacy, regardless of how the account was found.\n"
