How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious, then later showed it to mutual friends during a trivia night. The friend was upset about this, but the other friends didn't think it was a big deal. Now they want to know if they did something wrong.\n\nReddit is an online platform where people have some expectation of privacy. Even if the account isn't private, sharing someone's online identity without their consent can be an issue. The username here included real names, which might have been a mistake on the friend's part, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to expose it. The author's action was sharing the account details with others, which could lead to the friend feeling their privacy was invaded. \n\nEven if the content isn't harmful, like sports comments, the act of revealing someone's online persona without their permission could be seen as a breach of trust. The friend's reaction about a \"sacred Reddit code\" might be a bit over the top, but their discomfort is valid. The author didn't ask for permission and just assumed it was okay because of the username. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have been careless with their username choice. However, just because someone makes a mistake in choosing a username doesn't automatically give others the right to exploit that. The key here is consent. The author didn't get consent to share the account, so even if the content is innocuous, the act of sharing without permission is problematic.\n\nThe author's justification that they didn't think it was a big deal because it's just Reddit doesn't consider the friend's perspective. Privacy matters, and even if the content isn't malicious, exposing someone's online identity can have consequences. The other friends making fun of the friend for being triggered might have lightened the mood, but it doesn't negate the initial action.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely overstepped by sharing the account without permission. The fact that the friend was upset shows that the action had an impact, even if the content wasn't harmful. The line between a joke and an invasion of privacy is thin here, and the author crossed it by not respecting the friend's privacy boundaries.\n"
