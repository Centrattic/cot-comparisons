How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in real life.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend was using a Reddit account with a username that was almost their real name. They browsed the friend's history and later told others about it during a bar trivia night, showing the account. The friend got upset, feeling there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life. The author argues that the friend shouldn't be surprised if he used a username close to his real name in a local subreddit.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Reddit is a platform where users can choose to remain anonymous or use pseudonyms. The friend chose a username that's almost his real name, which might indicate he's okay with some level of real-world identification. However, even if the username is obvious, sharing that account with others without the friend's consent could still breach his privacy. People might use Reddit to express opinions they wouldn't share openly, even if the username is close to their real identity. The friend's reaction suggests he didn't want that information shared, so the author's action violated that privacy expectation.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to browsing the friend's history, which might have included things the friend didn't want others to see. Even if nothing was found, the act of sharing the account without permission is a breach of trust. The author's argument that the username was obvious doesn't fully address the breach of privacy. The friend's intention to keep his Reddit activity separate from real life matters here, and the author undermined that by exposing it.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's an unspoken expectation that Reddit accounts are kept separate from IRL interactions. The author's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of the content. The friend's irritation is valid because his privacy was invaded, even if unintentionally. The author's friends making fun of him for being triggered doesn't negate the fact that the action was a privacy violation.\n\nSo, even though the username was easy to guess, the author didn't have the friend's consent to share the account. The key issue is the lack of consent and respect for the friend's privacy, which makes the author at fault.\n"
