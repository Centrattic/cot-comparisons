How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. I need to figure out if it's A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was his first name plus the first three letters of his last name. Then, they told the story to other friends at a bar, showed them the account, and this made the friend upset. The friend felt it was a breach of some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author thought it wasn't a big deal.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's use of a semi-identifiable username in a local subreddit might imply some level of privacy. Even though the username was easy to guess, the act of exposing it to others in real life could be seen as violating that privacy. The author argues that the friend should have used a more anonymous username, but the friend didn't expect his online identity to be revealed. \n\nReddit users often value anonymity, and using a username that's almost their real name could be a mistake, but that doesn't mean the author's action is justified. The author had access to the friend's account and shared it without consent. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of revealing someone's online presence without permission can be a privacy issue. The friends making fun of the friend for being \"triggered\" might indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings. \n\nThe author's defense is that the friend's username was obvious, which is true, but the responsibility for privacy isn't solely on the friend. The author's action was to expose it to others, which is a choice they made. Even if the content was innocuous, the violation of trust is there. The friend felt it was a big deal, and the author dismissing it by saying \"what do you expect\" might come off as dismissive of the friend's privacy concerns. \n\nSo considering all that, even though the friend's username was guessable, the author's action of revealing it without consent is a breach of privacy. The key here is the lack of consent and the potential for embarrassment or discomfort. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
