How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation involves the author figuring out their friend's Reddit username by using their real name and some context clues. Then, they showed the account to others during a trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming it's a breach of some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author doesn't think it's a big deal because the content isn't offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The friend chose to use a username that was almost their real name in a small community subreddit. That might have been a mistake because they didn't use a pseudonym. But does that mean the author is justified in exposing it? Even if the friend made themselves identifiable, does that negate their privacy expectations? The author didn't just know the username; they actively showed it to others, which could be seen as a violation of privacy, regardless of how the username was discovered.\n\nReddit users generally expect a level of anonymity, even if their usernames are close to their real names. The friend might have had the intention to keep their online presence separate from their real life. By exposing the account, the author could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the content isn't harmful. The friend's reaction is valid because their privacy was invaded.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that using a username with their name was a mistake isn't a solid defense. People can make mistakes in their online identities, but that doesn't give others the right to expose them. The key point here is the act of revealing the account without consent. Even if the information could be guessed, the act of exposing it is a breach of trust. The author's friends might have laughed it off, but the main issue is the respect for the friend's privacy. So, the author is in the wrong because they violated that trust and privacy, regardless of the username choice.\n"
