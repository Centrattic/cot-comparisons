How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends in real life. The situation is that the friend had a Reddit account with an obvious username, and the author found out and shared it with others.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the friend used a username that's almost their full name, the author found the account, shared the story, and showed it to friends. The friend was upset about being exposed. \n\nI need to consider privacy. Reddit is a public platform, but people might expect some level of anonymity, especially with usernames that are a mix of real names and other letters. Even if the username is obvious, the friend might not want their real identity linked to their online activity, especially when it's shared with others. \n\nThe author argues that the friend \"shouldn't expect privacy\" if they use a recognizable name. But even if the username is obvious, the friend might have still wanted to keep their account separate from their real-life identity. Exposing it could make them feel uncomfortable if others see their posts. \n\nAlso, the author's intention was to share the story and show the account, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the content isn't harmful. The friend's reaction suggests that they felt their privacy was invaded. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA,\" it's about whether the action was wrong regardless of the content. The fact that the friend is upset and the other friends took it lightly doesn't necessarily mean the author is right. The author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account, so that's a point against them. \n\nOn the other hand, the username was very identifiable, so maybe the friend didn't do enough to keep it private. But the author's role was to expose it even after the friend didn't take measures to hide it. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they revealed the friend's Reddit account without consent, even if the username was obvious. Privacy expectations should still be respected unless the person has waived them by using a public profile. But here, the friend might not have intended for their real identity to be known. The author's action, while not malicious, was a breach of trust and privacy, so they are at fault.\n"
