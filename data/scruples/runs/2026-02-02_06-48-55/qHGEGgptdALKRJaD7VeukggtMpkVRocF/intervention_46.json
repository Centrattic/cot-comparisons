How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author discovered their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious\u2014using their first name and part of the last name. The friend was posting on a local subreddit, which made it easy to identify. The author then told their other friends about this account during a trivia night and showed them the account.\n\nThe friend was upset about this, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life. The author defended their actions by saying the username was obvious and they didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The friend's privacy might be a concern. Even if the username was obvious, the friend might not have intended for others to find out their identity. The author accessed the account's history, then shared it with others, which could be a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction indicates they didn't want this exposure, which is a red flag.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms to maintain anonymity. Even if the username was easy to guess, the act of revealing it to others without consent could be seen as violating that anonymity. The author's argument that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if using a local subreddit and an obvious username is a common defense but doesn't necessarily justify the action. Privacy expectations can vary, and the friend's discomfort suggests they had a right to expect their online identity to stay separate from their real life.\n\nAlso, the author shared the account with others, which might have made the friend feel exposed or embarrassed, even if the content wasn't harmful. The social norm here might be that exposing someone's online identity without permission is a breach of trust, regardless of the content.\n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything malicious, just shared information that others found amusing. But intent doesn't always mitigate the impact. The friend felt violated, and the author might have overstepped by sharing the account details.\n\nSo, in this case, while the username was easy to guess, the act of exposing it without consent is a privacy invasion. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
