How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their mutual friends. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was pretty obvious\u2014first name and three letters of the last name. The friend was using a local subreddit, which is a small community, so it's easy to guess who people are. The author then told other friends about it during a trivia night, showed them the account, and the friend got upset about it.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at privacy aspects. Even if the username makes it easy to guess, Reddit is still a platform where people expect a certain level of anonymity. The friend probably created that account under the assumption that their online activity isn't going to be shared in person. The author might argue that the friend didn't have a strong privacy expectation given the username, but others might say that the friend's choice of username doesn't negate their right to keep their online presence separate from their real-life interactions.\n\nThen there's the act of exposing the account. The author didn't just mention the username; they showed the account to the friends. The friend found this a big deal, which suggests that the action crossed a boundary. Even if the content wasn't malicious, sharing someone's online activity without their consent could be seen as violating their privacy. The author's argument is that the friend didn't take Reddit seriously and used a username that gave away their identity, but that doesn't necessarily justify sharing it with others. The friend might have wanted to keep their online and offline selves separate, which is a common practice for many people to avoid judgment or pressure.\n\nAlso, the author's friends made fun of the friend for getting upset, which might indicate that the social group has a culture of not respecting online privacy. However, that doesn't make the action right. The author might have a point in thinking the friend is overreacting, but the key here is consent. The friend didn't agree to have their account shared, so the author went against their expectations, even if those expectations weren't clearly communicated.\n\nIn terms of the \"sacred Reddit code,\" it's a colloquial term, but it reflects a community norm where anonymity is valued. The author might not have known about that, but norms exist for a reason. The fact that the friend felt violated suggests the author's actions were inappropriate. The author might not have intended to cause harm, but the outcome was that the friend felt their privacy was breached.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably is in the wrong because they shared their friend's online account without consent, despite the username being guessable. The friend's reaction, while maybe surprising to the author, is valid because privacy expectations exist even on platforms where some information is public. The author's justification about the username not being a secret doesn't override the friend's right to have their online activity kept separate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
