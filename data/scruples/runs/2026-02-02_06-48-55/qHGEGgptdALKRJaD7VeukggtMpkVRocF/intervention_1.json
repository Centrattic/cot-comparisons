How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which used the friend's first name and part of the last name. The community is small, so it was obvious. The author then shared this account with their friends at a bar, leading to the friend getting upset.\n\nNow, considering privacy. The friend probably expected some level of anonymity or at least not having their online presence exposed. Even though the username was semi-public, the act of revealing the account to others might have breached that person's privacy. The friend's reaction suggests he valued his Reddit activity as a private space, which is common. People often use Reddit to express themselves more freely, even if their usernames aren't completely anonymous. \n\nThe author argues that the friend was careless by using a recognizable username. But even if the username was semi-public, sharing it with others could still be a violation. The friend might have wanted to keep his online persona separate from his real-life interactions. The fact that others made fun of him for getting \"triggered\" doesn't negate the fact that the author violated his privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's justification that the content wasn't embarrassing doesn't matter because the issue here is about the act of exposing the account, not the content itself. The friend's privacy expectations matter here. So, even if the author didn't think it was a big deal, the friend did, which makes the author responsible for crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
