How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to others in person. The back story is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username because it was obvious with their name and parts of their last name. Then, when they met up with friends, the author showed the account, and the friend got upset.\n\nSo first, I need to consider privacy. Even if the Reddit account isn't hiding anything illegal or extremely embarrassing, people might have an expectation of anonymity or at least not having their online persona known by others without consent. The friend's username was a mix of their real name and last name, but maybe they didn't want others to connect their online activity to their real life. \n\nThe author argues that since the friend used a username that was easy to guess, they shouldn't be surprised. But using a username like that doesn't necessarily mean someone is okay with others exposing it. People might not be aware of how obvious their usernames are. The author did some lurking and then shared the account without the friend's permission, which could be seen as violating that friend's privacy.\n\nAlso, the friend felt it was a big deal, and even though the author didn't think it was, the key point here is whether the action was a breach of trust or privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of sharing someone's online identity without their consent could be considered wrong because it's about respecting their boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended any harm, and the friend's reaction is seen as over-the-top. But the question is whether the author was wrong, regardless of intent. Privacy breaches can be unintentional but still harmful. The friend's right to have their online activity remain private, even if it's public in a subreddit, is something to consider. Public information doesn't always mean it's okay to share in person without consent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they shared someone else's private account details without permission, which can be seen as a breach of trust and privacy, even if the content wasn't harmful. The friend's reaction highlights that the author overstepped by exposing their account.\n"
