How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username because it was obvious (small community, similar name) and then later showed it to their friends during a trivia night. The friend got upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that's close to their real name, but does that mean they're okay with being exposed? Maybe not. Even in a small community, people might expect some level of online anonymity. The author might think that since the username was easy to guess, sharing it isn't a big deal. But the friend felt violated, which is a key point here.\n\nAlso, the author browsed the friend's Reddit history without permission. That's a privacy issue even before sharing it. The act of revealing someone's online presence without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the content isn't harmful, the principle is about respecting someone's privacy. The friend felt that Reddit is a private space, and the author didn't consider that. \n\nThe response from the author's other friends makes fun of the friend for being triggered, which shifts blame away from the author. But the main question is whether the author overstepped. Even if the username was easy to find, sharing it without asking is a privacy violation. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings and expectations of privacy. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they exposed their friend's account without permission, violating their privacy despite the username being guessable. The friend's reaction is valid because the expectation of privacy was breached.\n"
