How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account because they used an obvious username with their first name and part of their last name. The community is small, so it made sense. The author didn't do anything bad like sharing personal info, just showed it to friends during trivia night. The friend was upset about it, but others didn't think it was a big deal. The author argues that using a semi-real name in a small subreddit is a bit risky, but maybe the friend didn't consider that.\n\nHmm, privacy on Reddit is a thing. Even if the username is obvious, people might expect a certain level of anonymity. The author didn't hack or anything, just used public info. But by showing it to friends, they're exposing it in real life, which could be a breach of trust. The friend felt violated, which matters. Even if the content wasn't bad, the act of revealing the account without consent is the issue here. The author's friends laughed it off, but the friend was actually upset. \n\nReddit's \"sacred code\" isn't real, but the friend's reaction shows they value their online privacy. The author might not have intended harm, but they should have respected the friend's privacy. Even if the username is obvious, sharing it without permission is a no-go. So the author probably is in the wrong because they shared someone else's personal account without their consent, regardless of how public the information was.\n"
