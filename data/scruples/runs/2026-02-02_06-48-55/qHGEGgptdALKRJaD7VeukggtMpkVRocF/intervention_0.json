How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends in real life. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was just the friend's first name and the first three letters of his last name. Since they live in a small community, it was easy to figure out. The author then told other friends about it and showed them the account during a trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping accounts private. The author argues that using an almost full name as a username in a small community subreddit makes it obvious who it is.\n\nSo, the main points here are: privacy, consent, and the context of Reddit usage. Reddit is an online platform where people might expect a certain level of anonymity, especially if they use pseudonyms. Even if the username is close to their real name, the friend might have still expected that their online persona remains separate from real life. By exposing the account, the author potentially breached that privacy. \n\nEven if the content isn't harmful or embarrassing, the act of sharing someone's online identity without their permission is a privacy issue. The friend might have wanted to keep their online and offline interactions separate. The author's argument about the username being obvious doesn't negate the fact that they shared it without consent. \n\nAlso, the friends made fun of the guy for getting upset, which might indicate they didn't take his privacy concerns seriously. The author might be dismissing the friend's feelings by saying they didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author did something that invaded their friend's privacy, even if the intent wasn't malicious. The friend's reaction is valid because they didn't consent to their account being shared. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
