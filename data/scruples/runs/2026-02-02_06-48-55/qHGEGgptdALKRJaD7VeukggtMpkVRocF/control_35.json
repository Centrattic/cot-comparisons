How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. So, the situation is that the author found their friend's Reddit account by guessing the username, which was almost their real name. Then they told other friends about it and showed the account during a trivia night. The friend got upset, thinking there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts. The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used an identifiable username.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the username is easy to guess, people generally expect some level of anonymity online. Reddit is a platform where users might share personal thoughts, and exposing an account without consent can be a privacy violation. The friend's reaction suggests they valued their Reddit activity as private. The author might argue that the friend's choice of username made it easy to find, but does that justify sharing it?\n\nThen, there's the social norm aspect. The \"sacred Reddit code\" mentioned by the friend is probably about keeping online identities separate from real life. Even if the content isn't bad, sharing someone's online handle in person could lead to more exposure, especially in small communities. The author's friends made fun of the friend, which adds to the social pressure.\n\nIntent matters too. The author didn't mean to cause harm, just thought it was a funny story. But intent doesn't always negate responsibility. The key point is consent. Did the friend give permission for their account to be shared? No. So, the author took away the friend's control over their online presence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could say the friend's username was too obvious. But using a name like first name + first three letters of the last name is still a username, and people might do that for a reason, like being recognized in a local subreddit without revealing full identity. Maybe they didn't expect someone to find them through that.\n\nSo, even if the username was guessable, sharing it without consent is a breach of trust. The author's actions led to the friend feeling exposed, even if others didn't take it seriously. Privacy is about control over one's information. The author didn't respect that boundary, so they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
