How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation involves the author discovering their friend's Reddit account through some clues and then showing it to mutual friends in person. The friend got upset about it, claiming it's against some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author thinks it's not a big deal because the account isn't posting anything harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author found the friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was almost their real name. Then, they told their friends about it and even showed the account during a social event. The friend felt this was a breach of privacy, even if the content wasn't offensive.\n\nReddit is a platform where many people use pseudonyms, and there's a culture of keeping online identities separate from real life. By exposing the friend's Reddit account, the author might have violated that unspoken agreement. Even if the username was obvious, the act of revealing it could be seen as a privacy breach. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their online anonymity, which others might not take into account.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the friend's choice of username made it easy to find, implying that the friend didn't take sufficient precautions for privacy. However, expecting someone to completely obscure their identity in a small community might be unrealistic, but that doesn't mean others can expose it without consent. The author's action, while perhaps not malicious, could still be considered a violation of trust.\n\nThe situation is a bit ambiguous. The author didn't post anything harmful, but the act of exposing the account without permission could still be wrong. Privacy expectations matter here. Even if the content is benign, the friend might have wanted to keep their Reddit activity separate from their real-life identity. The author's friends making fun of the upset friend doesn't help, but the main issue is the exposure of the account.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't ask for permission, and regardless of the username's obviousness, the friend's privacy was breached. So, the author is probably in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
