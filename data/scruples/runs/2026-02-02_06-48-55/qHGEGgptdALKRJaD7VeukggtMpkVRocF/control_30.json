How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which used the friend's first name and the first three letters of the last name. The community is small, so it was obvious. The author then told other friends about the account during a trivia night, showed them the account, and this made the friend upset. The friend felt like there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts. The author argues that using almost your full name in a local subreddit isn't private.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy and consent. The friend didn't want their Reddit account to be known by others. The author accessed the account (though only the history, nothing private) and then shared it with others. Even if the content isn't embarrassing, the act of revealing the account without permission could be a breach of privacy.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms, and there's an unspoken expectation of anonymity, especially in local communities. Even if the username gave away the identity, the friend might not have intended their online presence to be shared with others. The author's action might have violated that unspoken trust, regardless of the content. \n\nThe key points here are intent and consent. The author didn't ask the friend if it's okay to share their account with others. Even if the information wasn't sensitive, the friend felt violated. The concept of \"sacred Reddit code\" might not be real, but the friend's feelings are real. The author's justification about the username not being private is debatable, but the act of exposing it still went against the friend's wishes. \n\nTherefore, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared their friend's account without permission, leading to discomfort. Even if the content wasn't bad, the act of exposing the account without consent breaches privacy.\n"
