How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about exposing a friend's Reddit account to other friends in real life.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was pretty obvious with their real name. The friend wasn't posting anything bad, just some sports comments. Then, when they met at a bar, the author told the others about finding the account and showed them. The friend was upset, thinking it's a violation of Reddit's \"sacred code\" of keeping accounts private. The author argues that using a near-real-name username in a small community subreddit makes it easy to find, so they shouldn't be surprised.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy expectations. Reddit users often use pseudonyms, but if someone uses a username that's almost their real name in a small community, does that mean they have no right to privacy? The friend was upset about exposure, even if the content wasn't embarrassing. The author didn't think it was a big deal because they don't take Reddit seriously, but the friend did.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's privacy was breached by sharing their Reddit account with others without consent. Even if the username was guessable, the friend might have expected that their online presence, even with a near-real name, would stay within the online community. The act of exposing it to others, even friends, could be seen as a violation. The author's justification is that the friend used an identifiable username, but that doesn't necessarily negate the friend's discomfort. Privacy is about consent and expectation. The friend didn't want their account shared, so the author's action went against that expectation.\n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong. Answering A.\n"
