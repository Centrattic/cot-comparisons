How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The person found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious, using their first name and part of the last name. They checked the friend's history but didn't find anything problematic. Then, later, they told other friends about it and showed them the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, feeling it was a breach of privacy, but the author thinks it's not a big deal because the content wasn't bad.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. The friend might have expected his Reddit activity to stay online and not be shared IRL. Even though the username was guessable, that doesn't necessarily mean others should expose it. Reddit users often value their anonymity, even if their usernames are identifiable. By sharing the account with friends, the author took something that was meant for online use and brought it into the real world, which could make the friend uncomfortable. \n\nThe author argues that the friend shouldn't have used an identifiable username, but that's a bit of an invasion of privacy. Even if the info is public, sharing someone's account details without permission can be considered a breach of trust. The friends at the bar made fun of the friend, which might have added to the discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy expectations. The friend didn't agree to have his account shared, so the author overstepped by doing so. Even if there's no malicious intent, the action itself was a privacy violation. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
