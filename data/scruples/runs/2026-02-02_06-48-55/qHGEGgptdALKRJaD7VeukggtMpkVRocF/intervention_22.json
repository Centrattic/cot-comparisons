How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. So, the situation is that the author discovered their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which included the friend's first name and part of the last name. Then, they told other friends about it at a bar, showed them the account, and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend used an identifiable username on a local subreddit, which made it easy to figure out who he is. The author didn't just know about it but shared it with others. The friend felt violated, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping the account private. The author argues that the friend should be cautious online, especially with a username that's almost his full name.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the friend's username was obvious, the act of sharing someone's online account without their consent could still be a privacy issue. People might use Reddit to express themselves more freely, expecting some level of anonymity. By exposing the account, the author might have breached that trust, even if the content wasn't anything harmful. The friend's reaction shows that he valued his privacy, and the author didn't respect that. The fact that others made fun of him at the bar could have made the situation more uncomfortable for the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the friend should have used a more anonymous username. But just because someone's identity can be guessed doesn't mean it's right to share it without permission. The line between privacy and curiosity is thin here. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, still involved exposing personal information without the friend's consent, which is a breach of privacy. \n\nTherefore, even though the friend might have contributed to the situation by using an identifiable username, the author's act of sharing the account without permission is still a violation of trust. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
