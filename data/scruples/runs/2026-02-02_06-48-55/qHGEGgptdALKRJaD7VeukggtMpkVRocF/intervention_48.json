How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their mutual friends in person (IRL). The scenario involves the author figuring out their friend's Reddit username by noticing the username pattern in a local subreddit. They then told their friends and showed them the account during a trivia night. The friend was upset about it, claiming it's a violation of Reddit's \"sacred code,\" while the author thinks it's not a big deal because the content wasn't embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and consent. Even though the friend used an almost real name on a local subreddit, that doesn't necessarily mean they intended for others to know their identity. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to share someone else's account details without their permission. The author might have thought it was obvious and not a big deal, but the friend felt it was a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nReddit's \"sacred code\" isn't an official rule, but there's a culture where users often expect their online identities to remain separate from real life. The friend's reaction suggests that he valued this separation. The author's actions exposed his online presence to others in a way he didn't consent to, which could be seen as violating his privacy, even if the content itself wasn't harmful.\n\nThe author might argue that the friend should have been more discreet with their username, but that's not entirely their fault. Using a username with personal information in a local subreddit is a common practice, but it's still a personal choice. The author's decision to share it without asking could be seen as overstepping, regardless of the content's nature.\n\nAdditionally, showing the account to others during a social gathering turned it into a public matter, which the friend might not have anticipated. Even if the author didn't think it was a big deal, the fact that the friend was upset indicates that the action had a negative impact on their relationship. The author's friends making fun of the friend for being \"triggered\" might have also escalated the situation, but the initial act of sharing the account was the catalyst.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the lack of consent and the breach of privacy seem to place the author in the wrong. The friend had a reasonable expectation that his Reddit activity wouldn't be shared without his knowledge. The author's justification about the username being obvious doesn't negate the fact that they shared private information without permission. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
