How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who exposed their friend's Reddit account is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend had a Reddit account with an obvious username (first name plus first three letters of the last name), and the author found it while lurking. Then they told other friends about it at a bar, showed the account, and the friend got upset. The author is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend's Reddit account was publicly accessible, right? The author discovered it by chance because the username was obvious. Then they shared it with friends without the friend's consent. The friend felt their privacy was invaded, even if the content wasn't anything bad. \n\nThe question is about whether the author overstepped. Even if the account wasn't private, sharing someone's online identity in person without their consent might be seen as a breach of privacy. The friend might have used Reddit as a space where they didn't want their real identity connected, even if it's public. So exposing that could be a violation of their privacy expectations. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests they felt it was a big deal. The author thinks it's trivial because it's just Reddit and the content isn't bad. But the main issue here is about respecting someone's privacy, not the content itself. \n\nSo, even if the account was public, by revealing the username to others and showing the account, the author might have breached the friend's trust. The friend might not want others to know their Reddit activity, even if it's public. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings or privacy boundaries here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared someone else's private (in the sense of online identity) information without consent, leading to the friend being upset. The fact that the account was public doesn't necessarily justify sharing it with others in person, especially if the friend didn't want that connection made.\n"
