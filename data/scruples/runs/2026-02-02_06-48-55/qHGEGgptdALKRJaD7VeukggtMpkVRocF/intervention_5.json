How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to their other friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was his first name and the first three letters of his last name. Since it's a small community, it's easy to guess who it is. The author then browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything serious. Later, at a bar trivia night, the author told the story and showed the account to their friends. The friend got upset and felt like the author broke a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping accounts private. The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used a username that's so obvious and in a public subreddit.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy and consent. The friend probably expected some level of privacy on Reddit, even if the community is small. The author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account details with others. Even though the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's online presence without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The friend might have wanted to keep their Reddit activity separate from their real-life interactions. \n\nAlso, the username choice does make it public, but that doesn't necessarily mean others can share it. The friend might have thought that using a semi-anonymous name was enough to keep it private. The author's defense that the friend \"should have known better\" doesn't negate the fact that the author took action without the friend's approval. \n\nIn terms of Reddit's \"unwritten rules,\" there's a common understanding that Reddit accounts are meant to remain anonymous or semi-private. Exposing someone's account could be seen as violating that norm, regardless of the content. The friend's reaction is valid because the author shared personal information without consent, which can be hurtful even if there's no malicious intent.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the username was guessable and the content wasn't harmful, the author isn't entirely at fault. But the main issue here is the lack of consent. Privacy violations can occur even in minor contexts, and the friend's discomfort is a valid reaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely did something wrong because they shared their friend's private account details without asking, leading to discomfort and a breach of trust. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
