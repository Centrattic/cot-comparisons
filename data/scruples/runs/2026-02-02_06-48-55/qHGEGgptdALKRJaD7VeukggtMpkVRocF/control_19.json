How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by noticing it was a small community and the username was almost their full name. Then, when they met up, they mentioned it and showed others, which upset the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that was close to their real name, but maybe they didn't want people to know it was them. The author didn't steal info; they just recognized it from context. But by showing it to others, they might have violated the friend's privacy.\n\nReddit users often assume some level of anonymity. Even if the username is obvious, others might still expect that their online presence isn't linked to their real life. The author might think it's not a big deal, but the friend felt it was, which matters.\n\nAlso, the author shared it with other friends, which could be seen as spreading the information. Even if the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing the account without permission is a privacy issue. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their online anonymity, which the author didn't respect.\n\nThe author's defense is that the username was obvious. But just because something is guessable doesn't mean it's okay to expose someone. Privacy is about respecting someone's wishes, even if the information isn't hard to find. The sacred Reddit code mentioned might be a meme, but the friend felt it was a breach.\n\nSo, the author probably did cross a line by sharing the account without the friend's consent, even if it was a trivial thing. The key point is about respecting others' privacy and boundaries, even if those boundaries aren't obvious to others.\n"
