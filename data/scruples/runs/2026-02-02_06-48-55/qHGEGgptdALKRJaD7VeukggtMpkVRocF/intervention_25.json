How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was using the friend's first name and part of the last name. The community is small, so it was obvious. The author then told other friends about it and showed the account during a trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming it's against some \"sacred Reddit code\" to expose accounts in real life. The author thinks maybe the friend is overreacting but isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the username is partially identifiable, the friend might expect some level of privacy on Reddit. Sharing someone's account publicly, even if it's just among friends, could be seen as violating that privacy. The friend's reaction suggests that he didn't want his online presence known by others, even if it's just his friends. \n\nSecond, the author's reasoning is that since the friend used a semi-identifiable username, he shouldn't expect privacy. But that might be a flawed assumption. People might use such usernames for convenience or because the community is small, not realizing that someone could connect it to their real identity. The author's action of exposing it, even without malicious intent, still invades the friend's privacy. \n\nThird, the friends present at the bar egged them on, which might have escalated the situation. However, the author made the choice to share the information. The friend's upset reaction indicates that he felt his privacy was breached, regardless of the author's intentions. \n\nIn terms of Reddit's norms, there's often an unspoken rule about keeping accounts private. The friend's mention of a \"sacred code\" might be hyperbolic, but the underlying sentiment is about respecting others' online anonymity. The author might not have malicious intent, but exposing someone's account without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nSo, even if the username was guessable, the act of sharing it without the friend's consent is a privacy violation. The author should have respected the friend's privacy and not shared the account details. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
