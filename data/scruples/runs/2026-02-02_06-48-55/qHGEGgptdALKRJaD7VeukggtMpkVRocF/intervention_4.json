How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their friends in real life. \n\nFirst, the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was obviously based on the friend's real name. The friend used a username that was easy to guess in a small community. The author then shared this account with others during a trivia night, which made the friend upset.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that he valued his privacy on Reddit. Even though the content wasn't anything bad, the act of exposing the account without consent might be a breach of trust. The key point here is consent. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to share his Reddit account with others. \n\nThe author argues that the friend should have been more careful with his username, but that's a common privacy issue. Just because someone's username is guessable doesn't mean it's okay to out them without permission. People might have personal reasons for keeping their online identities separate from their real lives. \n\nEven though the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing the account could lead to other issues. The friend might not want his online interactions to be linked to his real life, perhaps due to fear of judgment, harassment, or just maintaining a separation between online and offline personas. \n\nThe other friends made fun of the friend for being upset, but that doesn't negate the fact that the author didn't respect the friend's privacy. The author didn't have the right to share the account without permission, regardless of how harmless the content was. \n\nSo, even though the situation might seem trivial, the author did violate the friend's privacy by exposing the account without asking. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
