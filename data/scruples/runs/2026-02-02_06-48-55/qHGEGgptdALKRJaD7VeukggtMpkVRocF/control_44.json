How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found out their friend's Reddit account unintentionally, right? They were in a local subreddit and noticed the friend's username because it was obvious. Then later, when Reddit came up in conversation at the bar, the author showed the account to their friends. The friend felt it was a big deal and got upset, claiming there's some sacred Reddit code against exposing accounts. The author argues that the friend should have been more careful with his username.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author discovered the account unintentionally, didn't share anything harmful, and the friend's username was easy to guess. The author didn't know about the \"sacred code\" but thought the friend should expect some privacy if he was using a public platform with an identifiable username.\n\nReddit users often do use pseudonyms, but in this case, the friend's username was almost their real name. The author didn't have malicious intent; it was more of a light-hearted moment among friends. However, the friend felt violated. But does that make the author wrong? Well, the account was public, so technically, anyone could find it. The friend might have been negligent in choosing a username that's easy to identify. The author didn't hack or do anything secretive. So maybe the fault isn't on the author. Also, the friend's reaction might be overblown given the circumstances. The answer might be B, but I need to make sure there's no privacy breach here. Since the author didn't do anything beyond what anyone else could do, it's a B.\n"
