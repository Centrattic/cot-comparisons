How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which the friend had set up with their first name and part of their last name. The author then told their other friends about this and showed them the account during a trivia night. The friend was upset about this, feeling it was a breach of some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author and others didn't see it as a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friend used a username that was mostly their real name in a small community subreddit. The author discovered the account by recognizing the name and then shared it with others. The question is whether this exposure was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have expected some level of privacy on Reddit, even if their username wasn't completely anonymous. By using a username that's easy to identify, the friend might have contributed to the situation, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author had the right to expose it. Privacy is a big deal, and even if the friend isn't hiding anything, the act of exposing their account without permission could be seen as a violation of their privacy. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the friend's reaction shows that it was annoying or uncomfortable for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the friend's username made it obvious, and they didn't do anything malicious. The author didn't publicize it widely, just showed it to friends in person. The friends even made fun of the friend for being \"triggered,\" suggesting that maybe the friend was being overly sensitive. But that doesn't negate the fact that the author shared private information without consent, even if it was in a casual setting.\n\nReddit's terms of service might have rules about sharing accounts, but the main ethical question is about respect for privacy. Even if the information is discoverable, sharing it without asking can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might not have intended harm, but the friend felt their privacy was invaded. In such cases, the person who shared the information is usually in the wrong because they didn't get permission, even if the information wasn't secret in a traditional sense.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author probably is in the wrong. They took something private (the friend's Reddit identity) and shared it without consent, even if it was a small act. The fact that the friend was upset is a key indicator that the action was inappropriate, regardless of the author's intent.\n"
