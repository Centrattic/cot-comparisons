How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend was using a Reddit account with a username that clearly identified him. They browsed his history and later told others about it during a bar trivia night. The friend was upset, feeling that exposing his Reddit account was a violation of some kind of \"sacred Reddit code.\" The author argues that since the friend used a username that's almost his real name on a local subreddit, it's not their fault.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The key points here are privacy and intent. The friend likely expected some level of anonymity on Reddit. Even if the username was obvious, sharing that information publicly (especially with friends) could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author might not have intended harm, but the act of exposing the account and showing it to others could make the friend feel uncomfortable. \n\nReddit users often use the platform to avoid real-world consequences, so the idea that someone could connect their online activity to their real identity is a big deal. The author's defense that the username was obvious doesn't negate the breach of trust. Even if the content isn't harmful, the act of exposing it without consent is a privacy issue. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that he valued his online anonymity, which the author didn't respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they didn't do anything malicious and that the friend should have used a more private username. But the responsibility for privacy isn't solely on the friend; the author should have respected the friend's potential desire for anonymity. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the consensus often leans towards respecting others' privacy, even if the information isn't harmful. So, the author probably is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
