How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was basically their real name plus part of the last name. Then, they told other friends about it and showed them the account during a bar trivia night. The friend was upset about this, feeling it's a breach of privacy or something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the author did. They discovered the account through the username, which wasn't exactly hidden. The friend used a username that's very close to their real name, which in a small community makes it easy to guess. The author then shared this information with others. \n\nNow, the question is whether this is a violation of privacy. Reddit users often have pseudonyms, but in this case, the username was almost their real name. The friend might have expected some level of anonymity, but if they used a username that's too obvious, maybe they didn't take enough precautions. However, even if the username is obvious, the act of sharing it with others could be seen as a privacy issue. \n\nThe author argues that since the username was easy to figure out, the friend shouldn't be upset. But just because something is easy to find doesn't mean it's okay to share without permission. The friend's discomfort is valid because they might have wanted their Reddit activity to remain private, even if the username isn't a secret. \n\nAlso, the author's action of showing the account to others in person could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the content isn't harmful, exposing someone's online presence without their consent can feel like a betrayal. The friend's reaction of being \"triggered\" suggests that they felt their privacy was invaded. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. They found the account through public means and shared it in a social setting where others were curious. But the key point here is consent. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to share their Reddit account. Even if the friend's username is obvious, the act of sharing it without permission is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's privacy by sharing the account without consent, even if the information was public. The friend had a reasonable expectation of privacy on Reddit, and the author's action, while not malicious, violated that expectation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
