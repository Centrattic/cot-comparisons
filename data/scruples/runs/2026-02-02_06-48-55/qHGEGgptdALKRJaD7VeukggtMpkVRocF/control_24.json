How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in person. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend used a username that was almost his real name on a local subreddit. The author figured out it was him and later showed his friends the account. The friend was upset about it. The author argues that the username was obvious, so there's not much privacy there. But the friend felt his Reddit anonymity was violated.\n\nHmm. Reddit is a place where people often use pseudonyms to keep their online presence separate from real life. Even if the username is close to the real name, the expectation might be that others won't connect it to the person IRL. The author might have breached that trust, even if the friend wasn't hiding anything bad. The key point is about consent. The friend didn't give permission for his account to be shared. So even if the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing it without consent could be wrong. \n\nAlso, the author admits they browsed the friend's history, which might be another privacy issue. But the main question is about sharing the account with others. The friend felt violated, which matters. So the author might be in the wrong here because they didn't respect the friend's privacy, even if the username was guessable. The answer is probably A.\n"
