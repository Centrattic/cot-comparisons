How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to their other friends. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious (first name and first three letters of the last name). Then, when they met up, the author told the others and showed the account. The friend got upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy, while the author argues that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if he used a public platform with an obvious username.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't create the situation where the friend's identity was linked to their Reddit account. The friend chose a username that made their identity clear. However, the author did take the step of revealing that account to others. Even if the username was public, sharing someone's online presence without their consent could be a privacy issue. \n\nReddit is a public platform, but people often assume a certain level of anonymity or pseudonymity. The friend might have wanted to keep their Reddit activity separate from their real life. By exposing the account, the author potentially breached that privacy. The author's argument is that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if they used such a username, but that's a bit of a stretch. People can choose usernames that are more obscure, but the friend made a choice here. The author's action of showing the account to others could have consequences, even if the content isn't harmful. The friend's reaction is valid because they felt their privacy was invaded. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have malicious intent. They found the account by accident and shared it in a social setting, not realizing the friend's discomfort. However, the action itself is still a privacy violation regardless of intent. The author should have respected the friend's privacy and not shared the account. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. The friend's privacy was breached, even if the information was publicly available. The key is that sharing someone's private online identity without their consent is a violation of trust and privacy.\n"
