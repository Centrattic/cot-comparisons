How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found their friend's Reddit account, which was pretty obvious because of the username, and then told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend got upset about it, and the author is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is about privacy and consent. The friend used a username that was easily identifiable, which might be a factor. The author didn't think it was a big deal because the content wasn't anything harmful. But the friend felt that their Reddit presence should remain private, hence the anger.\n\nReddit does have its own culture where people often keep their accounts separate from real life, so there's this unspoken rule of not exposing others. The author's action might have violated that, even if the content wasn't embarrassing. The friend's reaction is based on the breach of trust or privacy, regardless of the content's nature.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's username was a mix of their real name and initials, making it easy to guess. The author might argue that the friend shouldn't have used such an obvious handle. But on the other hand, even if the username is guessable, the act of exposing it to others without consent is a privacy issue. The friend didn't consent to their online presence being revealed, even if it's a public platform.\n\nThe author might not see it as wrong because the content wasn't harmful, but the key is about respecting boundaries. Even if the information is public, sharing it without permission can be a violation of trust. The friend's right to have their online identity separate from their real-life identity is important here. The author's actions led to the friend feeling that their privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared their friend's Reddit account without the friend's consent, regardless of the content's nature. The friend's reaction is valid because their privacy was breached, even if the username was guessable. The sacred Reddit code mentioned is about maintaining that separation, and the author crossed that line.\n"
