How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their friend's Reddit account, then showing it to other friends IRL. The friend was upset about this, thinking it's violating some \"sacred Reddit code.\" The author is defending their actions by saying the friend's username was obvious and that the content wasn't harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy aspects. Reddit is a platform where people might use pseudonyms, but this friend used a username that almost gave away their real identity. The author found it and then shared it with others. The friend was upset about being exposed. The key here is whether the author respected the friend's privacy. Even if the username was obvious, sharing it without consent could be a breach of privacy. The friend might have expected some level of anonymity on Reddit, which the author took away by exposing the account to others.\n\nAlso, the author's justification that the friend's username was obvious doesn't necessarily make it okay. Just because someone's identity can be guessed doesn't mean others have the right to confirm and share it. The friend's reaction is valid because they felt their privacy was invaded. The fact that the author didn't find anything embarrassing doesn't negate the breach of trust. The other friends laughed it off, but that doesn't make it right. The main issue is consent\u2014did the friend agree to have their Reddit account shared? The answer is no, so the author went against their friend's expectations of privacy.\n\nReddit's terms of service might not explicitly cover this scenario, but from a social standpoint, respecting someone's privacy is important. Even if the content isn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's online identity without permission can be seen as a violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they shared their friend's account information without permission, disregarding his privacy expectations.\n"
