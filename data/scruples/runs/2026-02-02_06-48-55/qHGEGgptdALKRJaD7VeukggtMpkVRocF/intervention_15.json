How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was clearly identifiable. They browsed the friend's history but didn't share anything harmful. Then, at a bar, the author told others about this discovery and showed the friend's account. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some kind of Reddit \"code.\" The author argues that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if they're using an obvious username in a small community subreddit.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy and consent. Even though the friend's username was easy to guess, does that mean others are okay with having their Reddit activity exposed? Reddit users often expect a certain level of anonymity or pseudonymity. By exposing the account, the author might have breached that trust, even if the content wasn't harmful. \n\nBut the friend did use a username that's almost their real name. Maybe they didn't take proper precautions for privacy. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the author sharing it without permission. The line here is about respecting boundaries. The author might not have realized that their friend wanted their online presence kept separate, even if the username was obvious. \n\nAlso, the author showed the account to others, which could lead to embarrassment or discomfort for the friend. Even if the content wasn't bad, the act of exposing someone's online activity without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. The friend's reaction suggests they valued their Reddit identity as separate from their real life, which the author didn't respect. \n\nSo, even though the content wasn't harmful, the act itself was a privacy breach. The author didn't ask for permission and shared the account with others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. They should have respected the friend's privacy, regardless of how identifiable the username was.\n"
