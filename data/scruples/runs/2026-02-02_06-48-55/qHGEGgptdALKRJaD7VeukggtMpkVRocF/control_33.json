How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out a friend's Reddit account because the username was very obvious (first name and first three letters of the last name in a small community), then shared the account with other friends at a bar. The friend was upset about this, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code,\" and the others made fun of him for being triggered. The author is trying to figure out if they did something wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author discovered the account due to the obvious username, then shared it with friends. The friend was privacy-conscious about their Reddit activity, which is common since Reddit is a pseudonymous platform. The author's defense is that the username was too obvious and that the friend's content wasn't anything bad. The author also mentions they don't take Reddit too seriously.\n\nNow, considering Reddit's privacy angle. Users typically expect that their online activities, even if in local subreddits, are kept private. Even though the username was obvious, the friend might have intended their account to remain anonymous. The author's action of exposing the account, even if not malicious, could be seen as violating that privacy. The friend had the right to expect that their Reddit identity isn't shared without consent. The author's reasoning about the username being obvious doesn't negate the breach of trust. Also, the friend's reaction, being somewhat irate, indicates that this was a significant issue for them. The other friends might not care, but the act of sharing someone's account without their permission is generally considered a privacy violation. So, even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of revealing the account's identity could be a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they shared their friend's personal information without consent, regardless of how obvious the username was.\n"
