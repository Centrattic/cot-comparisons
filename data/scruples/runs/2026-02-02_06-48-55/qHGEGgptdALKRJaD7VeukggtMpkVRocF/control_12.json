How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is at fault for revealing their friend's Reddit account to others. The friend got mad about it, and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which used the first name and part of the last name. Since it's a small community, that made sense. They then told their friends about it and even showed the account during trivia night. The friend was upset about this, thinking there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is privacy. Reddit users might expect a certain level of anonymity or separation between their online and offline identities. Even if the username was obvious, does that mean it's okay to out someone? The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used a recognizable username, but does that absolve the author of responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have chosen a username that's too identifiable, which could be seen as contributing to the problem. On the other hand, even if the username is obvious, others might not go looking for it. The author's action of showing the account to friends could be seen as violating the friend's privacy, regardless of how the account was discovered.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests they value their online identity's secrecy. Even if the content isn't harmful, the breach of trust is what's important here. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the friend felt exposed. So, even if the author didn't do anything malicious, they might have crossed a line by sharing the account without consent.\n\nReddit is a public platform, but users might expect that their accounts remain within the online context. The author's action brought that into the real world, which the friend found objectionable. The fact that others made fun of the friend for being \"triggered\" doesn't change the fact that the author's action caused discomfort. So, the author might be in the wrong because they shared someone else's account without considering their privacy expectations.\n"
