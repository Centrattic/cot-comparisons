How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious (first name plus three letters of the last name). They looked up the friend's history but didn't say anything at first. Then, later, they told their friends the story and showed the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy, while the author didn't think it was a big deal because the content wasn't offensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and consent. The friend's username was somewhat identifiable, but does that mean it's okay to share the account with others? Even if the content isn't harmful, sharing someone's online account without their permission could be seen as crossing a privacy boundary. The friend felt it was a big deal, which suggests that the author didn't respect their privacy. \n\nEven though the username was guessable, people might still have an expectation of privacy on Reddit. The author didn't ask for permission before exposing the account. The fact that the friend was upset indicates that the action was hurtful. The author's reasoning that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if using a semi-public username is a common defense, but it doesn't necessarily justify the action. People can have different boundaries, and the friend's reaction shows that this was important to them. \n\nAlso, the author showed the account to others, which could lead to embarrassment or discomfort for the friend. The friends made fun of the friend for being \"triggered,\" but that doesn't resolve the issue. The main question is whether the author violated the friend's trust and privacy. \n\nIn most cases, sharing someone's personal online information without their consent, even if it's publicly accessible, is a privacy violation. So the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
