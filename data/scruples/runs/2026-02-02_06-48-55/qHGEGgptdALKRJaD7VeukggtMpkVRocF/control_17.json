How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious, using the first name and part of the last name. They browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything bad. Then later, they told other friends about it and showed them the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, thinking there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life. The author argues that since the friend used an identifiable username on a local subreddit, they shouldn't be surprised. The other friends laughed at the friend for being triggered.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy and consent. The friend might have expected their Reddit account to remain private, even if the username was a bit obvious. By exposing the account, the author shared personal information without the friend's permission. Even if the friend's username wasn't secret, the content they post online might be something they don't want others to see in real life. \n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms, but some might still expect a level of anonymity. The author's action could be seen as violating that trust, especially if the friend didn't want their online presence to be connected to their real-life identity. The argument that the username was obvious doesn't necessarily justify sharing the account publicly. \n\nAlso, the context matters. Sharing it with mutual friends in a social setting might not be as severe as exposing it to strangers, but it's still a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction indicates that they felt their privacy was invaded. The author might not have intended harm, but the act itself was a privacy violation. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the friend's username was guessable, the author didn't have consent to share the account. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
