How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was almost their real name. Then, they told other friends about it and showed them the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming it's a breach of some Reddit \"code,\" while the author thought it wasn't a big deal since the friend's posts weren't harmful.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy and consent. The friend probably expected their Reddit activity to be private, even if the username was obvious. By exposing the account, the author shared personal information without the friend's permission. Even though the content wasn't bad, the act of exposing someone's online identity without their consent can be a violation of trust. \n\nReddit users often value anonymity, and using a slightly altered real name might be a way to keep some privacy. The author's action might have breached that trust, regardless of the content. The friend's reaction suggests they felt their privacy was invaded. The author's defense about the username being obvious doesn't negate the lack of consent. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, sharing someone's online account without permission is generally considered wrong. The other friends making fun of the upset friend doesn't help, but the main issue is the author's action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
