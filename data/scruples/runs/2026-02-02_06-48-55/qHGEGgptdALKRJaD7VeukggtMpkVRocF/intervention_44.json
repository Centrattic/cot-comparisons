How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out a friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name and then showed it to other friends. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some Reddit \"code.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that's almost their real name, but does that mean they waived their privacy? Maybe not entirely. Even if the username is recognizable, the friend might expect that their Reddit activity remains online and not shared IRL. The author didn't just find out but actively shared it with others, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The friend didn't give permission for their account to be exposed. Even if the content isn't embarrassing, the act of sharing someone's online identity without consent can be problematic. The author might argue that it wasn't a big deal, but the friend's reaction shows it was important to them.\n\nAlso, the idea of \"Reddit's sacred code\" is a community norm. Even if not a formal rule, users often expect their online personas to remain separate. The author dismissed this, which could indicate a lack of respect for the friend's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's choice of username made it easy to identify them. The author might feel it's not their fault for noticing it, but the key action was sharing it. The question is whether the author overstepped by showing it to others, even if it's just friends.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the information wasn't secret in a strict sense, sharing it without consent is a breach. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings and didn't ask if it was okay. So the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong, which is option A.\n"
