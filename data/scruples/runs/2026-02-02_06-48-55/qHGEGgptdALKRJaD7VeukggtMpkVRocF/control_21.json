How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their friends. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name and some other clues. Then, when they met up with friends, the author told the story and showed the friend's Reddit account. The friend got upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy or something.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The friend used a username that's almost his real name\u2014first name plus first three letters of the last name. The author argues that since the friend used an identifiable username in a small community subreddit, he's somewhat public about his identity. But the friend felt exposed because Reddit is supposed to be a pseudonymous space, and revealing the account in real life was a privacy violation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author violated the friend's privacy. On one hand, the friend's choice of username made it easy to identify him. On the other, even if the username is identifiable, people might still expect a certain level of privacy when using pseudonyms online. The act of exposing the account to others without consent could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of how obvious the username was.\n\nAnother angle is the context of Reddit's \"sacred code\" the friend mentioned. Reddit users often value anonymity, so exposing someone's account in real life might be considered a taboo there. The author didn't think it was a big deal because the content wasn't embarrassing, but the friend was upset. There's a difference in perspectives here. The author might not see the issue, but the friend does, which affects their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author shared the account with other friends, which could make the friend feel humiliated or exposed in front of others. Even if the content wasn't bad, the act of sharing someone's personal information without consent is generally considered wrong. Privacy is about consent and respecting boundaries, even if the information isn't sensitive.\n\nSo, even though the author found the account through a public means, sharing it without the friend's permission crosses into privacy concerns. The friend's upset reaction is valid because his online identity was revealed without his consent, which can be a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for sharing the account information without considering the friend's expectations of privacy.\n"
