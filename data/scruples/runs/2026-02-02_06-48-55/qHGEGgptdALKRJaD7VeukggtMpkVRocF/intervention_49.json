How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in real life. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend uses Reddit with an account name that's almost their real name. The author then told other friends about it and showed them the account during a trivia night. The friend was upset, claiming it's against some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author thinks it's not a big deal because the friend used an obvious username.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author didn't just find the account; they actively revealed it to others. Even though the username was almost their real name, does that mean they intended it to be public? Maybe not. People often use pseudonyms on Reddit for privacy, even if the name is close to their real one. The author's action of showing the account to others could be seen as violating that privacy. The friend's reaction, while maybe over the top, is about privacy concerns. \n\nThe author argues that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if they used a name close to their real one in a local subreddit. But using a username that's part of your real name in a small community doesn't necessarily mean you want it to be known by others outside the platform. The act of exposing the account to friends, even if they're close, might still be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. They were curious and shared it without thinking it was a big deal. The friend's upset reaction might be more about feeling exposed rather than the content of the posts. However, respecting someone's privacy, even in a casual context, is important. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The line here is between curiosity and privacy. Even if the username is guessable, sharing it with others without consent could be seen as a privacy violation. The author didn't ask the friend if it's okay to share, which is a key point. So, while the author might not be a \"total\" ass, they might still be at fault for not considering their friend's privacy expectations. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at intent, context, and the reasonable expectations of privacy. The friend's reaction suggests he did not want his Reddit activity to be discussed IRL. The author's action, while not malicious, disregarded that. So, the answer would likely lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
