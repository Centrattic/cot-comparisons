I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned. The author's mom is covering most costs except the rehearsal dinner. The author was looking into a videographer as per the mom's request. A family friend suggested a videographer via Facebook, which was too expensive. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented, emphasizing the importance of quality, and the author responded defensively, saying they don't need strangers to tell them how to run their wedding.\n\nThe author's main point is that they're tired of unsolicited advice from strangers. They responded with a comment that seems dismissive and a bit harsh. Now, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the context. The stranger's comment was likely meant to be helpful, even if it came off as pushy. The author's response was confrontational. However, the author had the right to set boundaries regarding their personal event. But the tone and choice of words might have been unkind.\n\nIn such situations, people often feel defensive when they're inundated with unsolicited advice, especially for such a personal event. The author's response was direct but could be seen as rude. However, defending the right to make their own decisions without interference isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the response was disproportionate to the situation.\n\nThe stranger's input was unsolicited, and the author had already explained budget constraints. The author's reply, while perhaps terse, was clarifying that they don't need outside input. But the way they phrased it\u2014calling the person a \"random stranger\"\u2014might come off as dismissive. Still, the core issue is the author asserting their autonomy, which is valid. However, the manner in which it was done could have been more diplomatic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to set boundaries, but the tone matters. If the author had said something like, \"We appreciate the suggestion, but we're sticking with our budget,\" that might be better. But their actual response was more confrontational. That said, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their right to make their own decisions. The mistake might be in the approach rather than the sentiment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's nuanced. The author had the right to set boundaries, even if the response was a bit harsh. The key is that they were defending their personal choices, which is understandable.\n"
