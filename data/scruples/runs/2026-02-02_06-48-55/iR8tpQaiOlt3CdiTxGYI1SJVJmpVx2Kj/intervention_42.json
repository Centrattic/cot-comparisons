I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning their wedding and dealing with unsolicited advice from strangers, particularly a family friend and her mom who's a videographer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The couple has already booked most vendors, and the mom is covering most of the costs except the rehearsal dinner. The fianc\u00e9e's mom asked her to look into videographers, so she did, even though they don't care much for it. A family friend suggested her nephew, who's overpriced, and the fianc\u00e9e politely said it's out of budget. Then, a stranger (the nephew's mom) comments about the importance of quality, implying they should pick her son. The fianc\u00e9e responds by saying they don't need the advice and that it's their day.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So I need to evaluate both sides. The stranger's comment is unsolicited and possibly pushy, trying to sell their son's services. The author's response is defensive and dismissive, which might come off as rude. However, the couple isn't obligated to accept advice from strangers. The key points are about the right to make personal choices without unsolicited input and the appropriateness of the response.\n\nThe author's comment \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" is a strong statement, but it's a valid point about autonomy. The stranger's comment was intrusive and possibly manipulative. The author's response was direct but not necessarily wrong. They had the right to set boundaries. The author might have handled it better with more politeness, but the core issue is about respecting their decision-making authority. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
