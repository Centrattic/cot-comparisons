I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning a wedding, and most of the big vendors are already booked. The mom is covering most of the costs, and the author was asked to check out videographers. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The author politely told the friend that he's out of their budget. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the post, pushing the idea that quality is most important. The author responds by saying they don't need input from a stranger and that it's their day.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was dealing with a stranger who is essentially a salesperson or someone trying to promote their son's service. The stranger's comment is a bit pushy, implying that not choosing her son's service would lead to a bad outcome. The author's response is firm but not aggressive. They made it clear that they don't need unsolicited advice and that it's their event to decide.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, people often get defensive when strangers give unsolicited advice, especially for something as personal as a wedding. The author had already been polite in declining the initial suggestion. The stranger then continued to push, which the author found annoying. The response was a clear boundary, which is understandable. However, the author's tone could be seen as a bit harsh, but considering the context, they were trying to stop further unwanted input.\n\nOn the other hand, the stranger might have been trying to help, even if it was from a self-serving angle. The author's comment about \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" might come off as dismissive or rude. But given that the author was already clear about the budget and the stranger kept pushing, the author's reaction is a reasonable defense of their autonomy.\n\nI think the main issue is that the stranger overstepped by commenting unsolicited advice, and the author was within their right to set boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
