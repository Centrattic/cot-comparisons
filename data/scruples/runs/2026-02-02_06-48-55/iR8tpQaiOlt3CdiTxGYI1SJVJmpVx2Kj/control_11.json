I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding planning conflict on Facebook.\n\nSo the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about the importance of quality, implying maybe the author should choose her son's services. The author responds by saying the budget is an issue and that strangers shouldn't comment on their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was asked by the mom to look into videographers, but they don't really care about it. The mom's comment seems to be pushing for her son's service. The author's response is defensive and a bit harsh, but maybe they have a right to be annoyed. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and respect. The stranger (the mom) is inserting herself into a personal decision, using the platform where the author was reluctantly using Facebook. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable. However, the tone of the response might be seen as confrontational. \n\nBut considering the author's frustration with strangers giving unsolicited advice, their response is a reaction to that. The author isn't being rude without cause. They were defending their autonomy. Also, the mom's comment could be seen as a sales tactic. The author's reply was to assert their control over the wedding planning. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The stranger overstepped by giving unsolicited input. The author's response might have been a bit abrupt, but it's not inconsiderate. They thanked her at the end, so there's a polite element. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had a right to protect their decision-making process from strangers.\n"
