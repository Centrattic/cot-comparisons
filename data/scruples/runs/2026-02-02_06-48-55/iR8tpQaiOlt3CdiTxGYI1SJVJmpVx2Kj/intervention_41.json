I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author responding to a stranger's comment on Facebook regarding their wedding vendor choice.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 and they had already booked most of their wedding services. The mom asked to check videographers, so they did. A family friend suggested her nephew, who was expensive. The author politely said he's out of budget. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality and media. The author responded by saying the budget is the issue and that they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were wrong to respond that way. The user initially thought the author was wrong but wants to know the opinion. So, the answer needs to be A or B.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author was approached by a stranger pushing their son's services. The author had already made decisions and was firm on the budget. The response was polite but firm, stating that the day is theirs and not needing input. The author felt defensive because of previous unsolicited advice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were within their right to set boundaries. The stranger's comment came off as pushy and possibly condescending, implying their choice was inferior. The author's response was to assert their autonomy. While the tone might have been a bit curt, the action of defending their decisions against unsolicited advice is justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
