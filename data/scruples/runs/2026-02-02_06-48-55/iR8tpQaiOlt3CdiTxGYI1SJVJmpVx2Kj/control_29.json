I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding planning conflict on Facebook. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most of the major vendors. The mom is paying for everything except the rehearsal dinner. The author's mom-in-law suggested a videographer through a family friend, but the nephew is too expensive. The author politely declined. Then, a random stranger (turns out to be the videographer's mom) comments about the importance of quality for the video, implying it's essential.\n\nThe author responds by saying the stranger shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding, emphasizing it's their day. The author feels harassed by strangers giving unsolicited advice.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they were polite when declining the initial suggestion. The stranger then added a comment that the author perceived as pushy. The author's response is a bit defensive, pointing out that it's their day and they don't need unsolicited input. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, strangers giving advice unsolicited can be annoying. The author has the right to set boundaries. However, the response might come off as harsh. The author says, \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" While the author is justified in not wanting unsolicited input, the tone could be seen as rude. However, given the context of repeated unwanted advice, it's understandable. The key points are whether the author crossed a line in their response. The initial decline was polite, and the follow-up is a reaction to the stranger's persistence. Since the author is the one being advised, they aren't in the wrong for asserting their autonomy over their wedding. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
