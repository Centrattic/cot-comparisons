I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding the way they did to a stranger's comment about their wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has already made most of their wedding decisions. The author was looking into a videographer suggested by a family friend. The family friend posted the nephew's page, and then the nephew's mom, a complete stranger to the couple, comments on Facebook saying that quality is the most important and that photos/videography last forever. The author responds by saying the videographer is out of budget and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the stranger's unsolicited advice. The author is frustrated with people they don't know giving input. The stranger's comment seems to be pushing for the more expensive option, implying that not choosing it would be a mistake. The author's response is defensive and direct, asserting their autonomy.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the stranger's intrusion into a personal decision, the author's right to make their own choices, and the appropriateness of their response. \n\nThe author's response was polite but firm. They stated the budget issue again and expressed frustration with strangers' input. The stranger's comment was unsolicited and possibly condescending, implying that the couple's preferences aren't valid. The author's reaction is a defense of their autonomy. \n\nIn social norms, people often get defensive when their personal choices are criticized, especially by strangers. The author's response is a valid expression of boundaries. While it's possible to be more polite, the content of the response is justified given the context. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter without being asked. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They were defending their right to make decisions for their own wedding without unsolicited input. The answer should be B.\n"
