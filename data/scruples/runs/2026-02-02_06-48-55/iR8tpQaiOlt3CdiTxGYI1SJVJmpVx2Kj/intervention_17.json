I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 had most of their wedding details already set. The author's mom asked them to look into a videographer. A family friend suggested her nephew, who's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the nephew's mom) commented on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality in videography. The author responded with a comment stating the videographer is out of budget and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nThe author's response is direct and a bit confrontational. They felt that the stranger was pushing her son's services and implying that not choosing him would lead to a worse wedding. The author is clearly frustrated with unsolicited advice from strangers.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The stranger's comment was an attempt to persuade them to choose her son's service, using emotional appeal. The author's response was to assert their autonomy and budget constraints. While the tone might be harsh, the author did address the budget point first and then expressed their stance on unsolicited input. \n\nHowever, the author's response could be seen as dismissive and a bit rude, especially towards the end. The phrase \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" is a bit confrontational, even if justified by their frustration. But considering the context\u2014strangers giving unsolicited advice about a major personal event\u2014it's understandable. The core issue is about respecting boundaries. The stranger overstepped, so the author's pushback isn't entirely uncalled for. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they were dealing with multiple people giving unsolicited advice. Their response was a reaction to that, and while the tone could be softened, the underlying message of setting boundaries is reasonable. The stranger initiated the unwanted input, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for defending their decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
