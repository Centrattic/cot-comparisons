I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation started with a family friend suggesting a videographer who was too expensive. The friend posted his page, and then his mom, a stranger, commented about the importance of quality and the lasting value of photos. The author responds by saying budget is a concern and they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, the author had already made decisions about most vendors, and the videographer was being recommended by someone not close. The stranger's comment came off as unsolicited advice, which the author found offensive. The author's response was polite but firm, stating their budget constraints and that it's their day.\n\nThe key points here are unsolicited advice from a stranger and the right to make personal decisions. The author isn't being rude, just setting boundaries. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter they weren't invited to discuss. The author's response was appropriate in asserting their autonomy. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
