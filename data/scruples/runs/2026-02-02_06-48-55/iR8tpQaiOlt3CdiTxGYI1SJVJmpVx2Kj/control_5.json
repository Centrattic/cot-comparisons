I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I get it right.\n\nThe person is getting married in December, and they're on Facebook looking for vendors. They've already booked most things, and their mom is covering the costs except the rehearsal dinner. The mom asked them to check out videographers, even though the couple isn't super into it. A family friend suggested a nephew of hers, but he's too expensive. The friend posted the page on their Facebook. Then, a stranger (who turns out to be the videographer's mom) comments saying that quality is most important because things like flowers and cake don't last. The author responds by saying the videographer is still out of budget, that the day is theirs, and they don't want strangers telling them how to run it. They feel defensive because the stranger's comment seems to imply that not choosing the suggested videographer would mean a bad wedding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author was polite initially, telling the family friend the videographer is too expensive. Then, the stranger (the videographer's mom) chimes in, pushing the importance of quality. The author's response was a bit snappish, but they were defending their right to make their own decisions. The author felt that the stranger was overstepping, which is a common issue with strangers giving unsolicited advice, especially on personal events like weddings.\n\nThe key points here are: the author has already made decisions, is within their budget, and is tired of unsolicited input. The stranger's comment was intrusive and possibly trying to push the videographer. The author's response was direct but not necessarily rude. They were asserting their boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, people get AITA when they're being inconsiderate, but here the author is defending their autonomy. The stranger was a random person commenting on a private matter. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
