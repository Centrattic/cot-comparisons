I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author responding to a stranger's comment on Facebook regarding a videographer recommendation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding booked, with the mother covering most costs. The mother-in-law suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author declined politely. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality in videography. The author responds strongly, saying they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the stranger was pushing for the videographer, which the author found intrusive. On the other, the author's response was defensive and maybe a bit harsh. \n\nBut wait, the stranger commented on a public post, which the author's mom had asked them to look into. The author had already declined the recommendation. The stranger's comment seems like an unsolicited pitch, which can be annoying. The author's response was to assert their autonomy, which is understandable. However, the tone of the reply might have been confrontational. The key here is whether the author had the right to be assertive or if they overstepped.\n\nThe author's main point is that they're tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. The stranger, being the videographer's mom, might have a vested interest in getting the business. The author's response was direct, but maybe they could have been more polite. However, since the author had already stated the budget issue, the stranger's comment was perhaps trying to guilt-trip them into choosing her son, which is unfair. The author's reply, while maybe a bit sharp, was defending their right to make decisions for their wedding. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about respecting boundaries. The stranger was overstepping by commenting on a personal matter they weren't close to. The author's response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a valid assertion of their autonomy. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
