I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author responding to a stranger's comment about a videographer they suggested.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, which the author checked out. The author found the price too high, so they politely declined. Then, the stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality and how the memories will last. The author responded defensively, saying they don't need input from strangers and that the wedding is about them being together.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is within their rights to set their budget and make decisions for their wedding. However, the way they responded might be too harsh. The stranger might have been trying to advocate for her son's services, but the author felt it was an intrusion. The author's comment about \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" is a bit dismissive, which could be seen as rude. \n\nOn the other hand, the stranger's comment was unsolicited advice, which can be annoying. The author was justified in not wanting unsolicited input, especially from someone they don't know. However, the author's response was confrontational. A more polite response might have been better. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to make decisions vs. the tone of their response. The author is not in the wrong for not wanting strangers' input, but their response could have been more courteous. However, in the context of social media, where people can comment without being asked, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the stranger gave unsolicited advice and the author's response was a reaction to that, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way they phrased it might be seen as harsh. But since the stranger was a stranger and the author was clearly stating their position, the author is justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
