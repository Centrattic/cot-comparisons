I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the post, emphasizing the importance of quality. The author responded defensively, saying they don't need strangers to dictate how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. Their response was direct and maybe a bit harsh. The stranger's comment was pushing for quality, which the author took the wrong way.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were defending their right to make their own decisions without interference. But their response was pretty strong. They said, \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" That's assertive, but maybe not entirely unreasonable. People often get frustrated with unsolicited advice, especially on social media. \n\nOn the other hand, the stranger's comment might have come off as pushy or condescending. The author's response was a bit confrontational, but they were standing up for their autonomy. The question is whether they were wrong. If the stranger was overstepping, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, maybe they could have responded more politely. But given the context, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their decisions against a stranger's interference. The response was a bit sharp, but not entirely unwarranted. The stranger's comment was intrusive, so the author's reaction is justified.\n"
