I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and the author are planning their wedding. The mom is covering most of the costs except the rehearsal dinner. The author checked out a videographer suggested by a family friend's nephew, but it's too expensive. They politely told the family friend that. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality, saying photos and videos last forever. The author responded by saying the budget is an issue and that they don't need strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was polite initially when told about the videographer. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments, and the author responds firmly. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nThe author felt that the stranger was pushing their product, implying that if they don't hire them, the wedding would be bad. The author's response was to say the budget is a factor and that it's their day. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom what I see, the author had a right to set boundaries. The stranger was trying to sell their service, maybe a bit pushy. The author's response was about asserting their own preferences and budget. The initial comment from the stranger might be seen as trying to upsell or pressure them, which the author rightfully rejected. The author didn't make a harsh comment, just stated their position and that they don't need unsolicited advice.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The stranger was overstepping by commenting on a personal matter they have no connection to. The author's response was appropriate in defending their autonomy over their wedding plans. The answer should be B.\n"
