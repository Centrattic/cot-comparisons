I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. So the situation is that a family friend suggested a videographer, but the author found him too expensive and told the friend. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented about quality being important. The author responded by saying they don't need advice and that it's their day. \n\nFirst, the author is within their right to set boundaries. The stranger wasn't asked for input and came in with unsolicited advice. The author's response was firm but polite, stating their budget constraints and asserting their autonomy. The key here is that the stranger was trying to pressure them by implying that without their son, the wedding would be bad. The author pushed back against that, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the author's tone might be seen as a bit harsh. They mention being \"beyond tired\" and responding with \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" While justified in not wanting unsolicited advice, the response could have been more diplomatic. But considering it's a personal matter and the stranger was overstepping, the author's reaction isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe main question is about being in the wrong. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical. They're defending their space and decisions. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
