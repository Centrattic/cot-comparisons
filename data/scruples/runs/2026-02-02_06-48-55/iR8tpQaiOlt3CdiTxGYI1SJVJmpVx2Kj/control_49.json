I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 and their mom are handling the wedding, and a family friend suggested a videographer via Facebook. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality. The author responds by saying they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has already made decisions on major vendors, and the fianc\u00e9's mom is covering most costs. The stranger's comment feels pushy. The author's response is defensive. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The comment from the stranger is unsolicited advice. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since it's their wedding. However, the tone of the author's response is a bit harsh. They accused the stranger of implying their wedding would be \"shit\" if they chose someone else, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nBut the stranger was trying to sell a service, which can come off as pushy. The author's response is a form of setting a boundary, which is understandable. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being rude. The stranger was not a close friend or family, so their input is less justified. The author's frustration is valid given the number of unsolicited opinions people often give about weddings. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author was within their rights to reject unsolicited advice from a stranger, even if their response was a bit strong. They are not in the wrong for defending their autonomy in planning their wedding.\n"
