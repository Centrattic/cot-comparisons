I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning their wedding. They found most vendors already, and their mom is covering the costs except for the rehearsal dinner. The author's mom asked them to check out videographers, even though they don't really care about having one. A family friend suggested her nephew, who's a videographer but too expensive. The author politely told the friend that he's out of their budget. Then, a random stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the Facebook post, pushing the idea that quality is the most important thing. The author responds by saying that the videographer is still out of budget, that the wedding is their day, and they don't need input from strangers. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The stranger was a videographer's mom, so maybe she was trying to advocate for her son's services. But the author already stated the budget issue, and the mom's comment seems to be trying to push the idea that the videographer is worth the cost. The author then tells her not to tell them how to run their wedding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author had every right to set their budget and not hire someone. The stranger's comment could be seen as overreaching, especially since they weren't invited to comment. The author's response was firm but polite. They might have overreacted a bit by calling the other person a \"random stranger,\" but it's understandable given the context. \n\nThe key points are that the author was defending their autonomy in wedding planning, and the stranger was imposing unsolicited advice. Weddings are personal, and it's common for people to have strong opinions, but it's the couple's decision. The author's response was within their rights. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
