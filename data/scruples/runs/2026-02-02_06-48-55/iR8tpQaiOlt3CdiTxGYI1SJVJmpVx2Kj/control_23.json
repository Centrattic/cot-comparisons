I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for responding the way they did to a stranger's comment about their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is planning their wedding, and the fianc\u00e9's mom suggested a videographer through a family friend. The author checked out the videographer but found him too expensive. Then a random stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the post, pushing the idea that quality (like a videographer) is important because photos and videos last forever. The author replies firmly that they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries and respect. The author is tired of unsolicited advice from people they don't know. The stranger's comment was unsolicited and came off as pushy. The author's response was polite but clear, stating their budget constraints and that they don't want outside input.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people often have strong opinions about weddings, especially when they're family or friends. However, the stranger here wasn't even part of the immediate network; she was the videographer's mom. Her comment was a bit condescending, implying that choosing someone else would lead to a worse outcome. The author's response was direct but respectful, explaining their reasons (budget) and asserting their right to control their wedding. \n\nThe key factors here are:\n1. The stranger's comment was unsolicited and possibly pushy.\n2. The author had already explained the budget issue, which the stranger didn't acknowledge.\n3. The author's response was firm but polite, defending their right to make their own decisions.\n\nIn such cases, it's common for people to feel defensive when strangers overstep. The author's main issue is with the intrusion into their personal decision-making. The response seems justified as a boundary-setting action. They didn't attack the person personally but stated their position clearly. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the tone could be seen as harsh, but given the context of repeated unsolicited advice, it's more about standing up for themselves. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their space and decisions regarding their wedding. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
