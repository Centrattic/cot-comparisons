I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have already booked most of the wedding. The author's mom is paying for most of it, but they're looking into a videographer. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the Facebook post about quality being important. The author responds by saying the budget is out of reach and that they don't need strangers' advice.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel strangers are giving unsolicited advice. The key points here are the unsolicited input and the author's response.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author's response was wrong. The author was polite when declining the family friend's suggestion. Then the stranger (the videographer's mom) adds a comment that might have come across as pushy or implying the author's choice is inferior. The author's reply is defensive, stating the budget issue and that the wedding is theirs. The question is whether this response was wrong.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, people often get annoyed with unsolicited advice. The author had already explained the budget issue, so the stranger's comment seems unnecessary. The author's response was firm but not aggressive. They were standing up for their own preferences. However, the tone of the response might be seen as dismissive or unkind. But considering the context\u2014repeated unsolicited input and the wedding being a personal event\u2014the author might have a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have responded more politely or ignored the comment. But given the frustration mentioned, it's understandable. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriate given the stranger's overstepping.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their personal space and had already been clear about the budget. The stranger's comment was intrusive. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
