I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding where the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already made most of the big decisions. The author's mom is paying for everything except the rehearsal dinner, and the author was checking out a videographer suggested by a family friend. The friend posted the videographer (her nephew) on the author's Facebook. The author politely said he's too expensive. Then, a random stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality and how photos and videos last forever. The author responds strongly, saying they don't need a stranger's input on how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is defensive about strangers giving advice, especially on a social media post. They felt the stranger was overstepping. The author's response was direct and maybe a bit harsh, but they had a reason to be upset since they were already frustrated with unsolicited input.\n\nFirst, the stranger wasn't part of their inner circle. The author didn't know her before. The stranger's comment came after the author had already declined the suggestion for budget reasons. The author's response was to assert their autonomy, which is understandable. People often get annoyed when strangers comment on personal events like weddings, especially when it's unsolicited.\n\nThe stranger's message implied that the author's choice would negatively affect the wedding's quality, which the author felt was dismissive of their priorities. The author's reply was firm, but it was in defense of their right to make their own decisions. In this case, the author isn't being disrespectful back, just setting a boundary. Since the stranger initiated the unsolicited advice, the author's response is justified. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
