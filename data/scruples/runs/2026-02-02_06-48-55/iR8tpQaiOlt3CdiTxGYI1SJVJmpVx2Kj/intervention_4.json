I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned. The author's mom is covering costs except for the rehearsal dinner. The author was looking into a videographer suggested by a family friend's relative, but the cost was too high. They politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the post, arguing that quality is important and that photos/videography matter because they last. The author responded that the budget is the issue and that strangers shouldn't dictate how they run their wedding.\n\nThe author feels that the stranger implied their wedding would be bad if they didn't go with the videographer. The author is frustrated with strangers giving unsolicited advice and defended their stance.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are:\n\n1. The stranger (the videographer's mom) gave unsolicited advice. The author was polite when declining the recommendation but then received more input from someone they don't know. The author had the right to set boundaries here.\n\n2. The author's response was direct but not necessarily aggressive. They stated their budget constraint and asserted that their wedding is their own. The tone could be seen as defensive, but given the context of repeated unsolicited input, it's understandable.\n\n3. The author's frustration is valid if they're overwhelmed by others' opinions. The situation might have been handled more calmly, but the core issue is about respecting boundaries.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The author was within their rights to decline the recommendation and express that they don't need strangers' input. The stranger's comment could be seen as intrusive, so the author's response is a reasonable assertion of their autonomy. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
