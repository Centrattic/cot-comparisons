I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 who are planning a wedding with most major vendors already booked. The author's mom is covering most of the costs except the rehearsal dinner. The author was looking into videographers as per their mom's request but found a family friend's nephew too expensive. The family friend posted the videographer's page on Facebook, and then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality. The author responded by saying the price is out of their budget and that they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel strangers are giving unsolicited advice. The key points here are the context of the wedding planning, the role of the family friend, the stranger's comment, and the author's response. \n\nFirst, the author had already made up their mind about the videographer being too expensive and had a polite initial response. Then the stranger, the videographer's mom, made a comment that the author found pushy. The author's reply was firm, stating that the budget is the priority and that strangers shouldn't dictate how they run their wedding. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was justified. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. The author's response could be seen as defensive, but they are within their rights to set boundaries on their own wedding. The stranger was giving unsolicited advice, so the author's pushback isn't unreasonable. The tone of the author's response might be a bit harsh, but considering the context of many people giving input they didn't ask for, it's understandable. \n\nIn social situations, people often have the right to decline advice they don't want. The author is asserting their autonomy over their wedding, which is a significant life event. The videographer's mom's comment might have come across as condescending, leading the author to respond strongly. The author is not wrong for setting boundaries with strangers who offer uninvited opinions. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their budget and preferences without outside interference.\n"
