I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation involves a family friend suggesting a videographer, which the couple can't afford. The author responds politely to the friend, then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about the importance of quality. The author then snaps back, saying they don't need input and that it's their day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has already made most of their decisions, and the author is handling the videographer request for the mom. The stranger's comment seems to be pushing for a more expensive option, implying that the couple's choice would lead to a worse outcome. The author is frustrated with unsolicited advice from strangers, which is a common issue in online spaces, especially for events like weddings that are highly personal.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's response was direct but not overtly rude. They mentioned the budget and emphasized it's their day. The stranger's comment might have come off as dismissive of the couple's priorities. The author's frustration is valid because they're dealing with a lot of input already. However, the tone of the response could be seen as a bit harsh, especially since the videographer's mom is part of the family friend network. But the author did address the budget issue first, so it's not like they were ignoring the suggestion without reason. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being unreasonable. They have a right to set boundaries, especially from strangers. The stranger overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a public forum. The author's response, while maybe a bit terse, is a reasonable boundary. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
