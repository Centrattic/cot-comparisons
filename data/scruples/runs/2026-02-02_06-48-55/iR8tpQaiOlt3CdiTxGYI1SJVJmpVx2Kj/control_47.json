I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple already has their main vendors booked. The fianc\u00e9's mom asked them to look into videographers. The author checked out a suggestion from a family friend's nephew, but he was too expensive. The family friend posted the videographer's page on the author's Facebook. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about quality being important and how photos last forever. The author responds by saying the budget is an issue and that it's their day, not wanting strangers to tell them how to run it.\n\nSo the key points here are that the stranger was pushing for a specific videographer, possibly trying to upsell or promote her son's services. The author was polite but firm in saying they can't afford it and doesn't want unsolicited advice. The author feels frustrated with strangers giving input despite not being close friends or family.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were responding to a comment from a stranger who was essentially pushing a service. The author's response was direct but not rude. They clarified the budget issue and their stance on the wedding being their own. The stranger's comment might have been overstepping by implying that using someone else would result in a bad wedding. The author's pushback seems justified because they have the right to make their own decisions without unsolicited input. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
