I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding planning conflict. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9 and their partner are planning their wedding, and the mom is covering most of the costs. They already have most vendors booked. The fianc\u00e9's mom asked them to check videographers. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The fianc\u00e9 politely said he's over their budget. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the Facebook post. She argues that quality is important because photos and videos last. The author responds by saying the budget is set, the day is theirs, and they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the author had a polite response initially when the family friend suggested someone expensive. The stranger (the videographer's mom) then added a comment pushing for quality, which the author felt was intrusive. The author's reply was a bit defensive and dismissive. \n\nNow, considering the context: the author is within their rights to set their budget and make their own decisions. The stranger commenting is indeed a stranger, and it's reasonable to not want unsolicited advice, especially from someone not close. The author's response was direct but not necessarily rude. They explained their stance and set boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's reply could have been more polite. Phrases like \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" might come off as harsh. But given the context of repeated unsolicited input, especially from a stranger, it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the stranger's comment was intrusive and possibly overstepping, as they didn't know the couple. The author's frustration is valid because they're managing their wedding, which is a personal event. The fact that the author was trying to accommodate the fianc\u00e9's mom by even looking into videographers shows they're trying to be considerate, but the stranger's input was unwelcome.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to decline the suggestion and set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
