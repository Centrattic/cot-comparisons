I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. So the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, which the author found too expensive. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about quality being important. The author responds by saying they don't need a stranger's advice and that it's their day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author has already made most decisions, and the mom's comment seems like unsolicited advice. The author's response was firm but polite. The key points are whether the author overreacted or was within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nThe stranger's comment could be seen as intrusive, especially since they were pushing for a specific vendor. The author's response was to clarify the budget and assert their autonomy. It's common for people to get stressed about weddings and feel pressure from others, so defending their choice might be justified.\n\nAlso, considering that the author's mom was the one who asked them to look into videographers, but the author and fianc\u00e9 aren't that interested, the input from a stranger might feel especially unwelcome. The response wasn't hostile, just clear. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They're protecting their event from unnecessary interference. Answer B.\n"
