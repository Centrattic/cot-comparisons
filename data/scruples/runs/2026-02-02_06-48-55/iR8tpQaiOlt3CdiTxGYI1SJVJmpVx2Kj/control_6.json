I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation involves a family friend's relative being recommended as a videographer, which the couple finds too expensive. The stranger, the videographer's mother, comments about the importance of quality, leading the author to respond defensively.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they were tired of strangers offering unsolicited advice. The stranger's comment could be seen as pushy, implying that their choice would affect the wedding's quality. The author's response was to assert their control over their day. \n\nThe key points here: the author was polite initially when rejecting the suggested videographer. The stranger then added her opinion, which the author found intrusive. The response was direct but not abusive. The author's frustration is about the intrusion by someone they don't know. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often get annoyed with unsolicited advice, especially for personal events like weddings. The author's response was a firm boundary setting. While the stranger might feel defensive, the author had every right to prioritize their budget and preferences. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
