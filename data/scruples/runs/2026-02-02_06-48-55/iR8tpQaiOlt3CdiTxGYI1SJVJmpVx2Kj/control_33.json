I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding plans set. They were looking for a videographer, but a family friend suggested someone expensive. The author declined because of the budget. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, commented about quality being important. The author responded by saying they don't need advice from strangers and that it's their day. The author is asking if they were wrong for that response.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author and fianc\u00e9 have already made most decisions.\n2. The mom of the videographer is a stranger to the couple.\n3. The stranger's comment was unsolicited advice.\n4. The author's response was firm, stating it's their day and not needing input from strangers.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Generally, people are expected to be polite and not be rude to strangers. However, the stranger was pushing a product (her son's videography services) under the guise of advice. The author felt harassed by unsolicited input, which is common in such situations.\n\nIs the author's response too harsh? They were polite in declining the initial suggestion from the family friend but were clearly put off by the stranger's comment. Their reply was direct but not necessarily rude. They explained their budget issue and asserted their right to make their own decisions without interference. The author's frustration is understandable, as many people feel that their wedding is personal and don't want unsolicited advice, especially from strangers trying to upsell services.\n\nThe stranger's comment was manipulative, implying that not choosing her son's services would lead to a less meaningful wedding. The author's response was a defense of their autonomy. In many cases, people are within their right to set boundaries, even if it means being firm with strangers. The author didn't attack the person personally; they just stated their position.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could have been more polite, but the stranger was being pushy. Also, the author's mom was involved in wanting a videographer, but the couple wasn't invested. The author's response to the stranger was justified because it was unsolicited and came off as pushy.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing up for their right to make their own decisions without interference from a stranger. The answer should be B.\n"
