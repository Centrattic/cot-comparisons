I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's mom asked them to look into videographers, and a family friend suggested her nephew, who's too expensive. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality and the photos being forever. The author responded by saying they don't need strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The main issue is the author's response to a stranger. The author is clearly frustrated with unsolicited advice, especially from people outside their close circle. The videographer's mom chimed in after the initial suggestion from the family friend. The author's comment was defensive, implying that the stranger's advice is unnecessary and possibly intrusive.\n\nNow, considering social norms. People often give advice about weddings, even if they're not asked, because they think it's important. But the author has stated that they don't need input, especially from strangers. The key here is whether the author's response was rude or within their right to set boundaries.\n\nThe stranger's comment was a bit presumptuous. She's suggesting that quality is the most important, but the author and their fianc\u00e9 don't prioritize a videographer. The author's reply was polite but firm, explaining that the most important thing is their own day and that they don't need unsolicited advice. The tone might be a bit harsh, but the author is asserting their right to make decisions without interference. \n\nAITA (Am I the Asshole) questions often hinge on respect and appropriateness. The author's response is direct and dismissive, but they were defending their choice and setting a boundary. The stranger's input was unexpected and perhaps overstepping, so the author's reaction is understandable. However, the comment \"your wedding will be shit\" is the author's interpretation of the stranger's intent, not what was actually said. The stranger might have been emphasizing the value of the service without implying a negative outcome if they choose otherwise.\n\nIn terms of fault, the stranger initiated the unwanted advice, which the author had already rejected. The author's response was a clear boundary, though maybe a bit snippy. But given the context of repeated unsolicited input, especially from a stranger, the author's frustration is valid. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were setting boundaries against unsolicited advice, which is acceptable.\n"
