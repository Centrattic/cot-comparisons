I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple planning their wedding, and a stranger (the videographer's mom) giving unsolicited advice on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but the author found him too expensive and politely declined. Then the videographer's mom, a complete stranger, comments on the post with advice about the quality being important. The author responds defensively, emphasizing that it's their day and they don't want strangers' input. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for their response.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The stranger's comment was unsolicited, which can be frustrating, especially when you're already overwhelmed with planning. The author has a right to set boundaries and protect their personal event. However, the author's response was a bit harsh. They accused the woman of implying their wedding would be \"shit\" if they didn't hire the videographer. That might be an overreaction. The stranger's comment was probably meant to highlight the importance of videography, but the way the author responded could come off as confrontational.\n\nThe key points are: the stranger gave unsolicited advice, the author dismissed it, and the author's response was defensive. While the author has the right to not want unsolicited input, their reaction might not have been the best way to handle it. Maybe a more polite dismissal would have been better. But the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" because they were standing up for their personal choice. However, the tone of their response was harsh. So balancing both aspects, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, since the options are only A or B, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on the analysis. The author's response was defensive but not cruel, and they had a valid reason to want to avoid strangers' input. So the answer is B (No).\n"
