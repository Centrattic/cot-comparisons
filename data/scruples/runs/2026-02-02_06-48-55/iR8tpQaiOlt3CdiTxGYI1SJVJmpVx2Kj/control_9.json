I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding the way they did to a stranger's comment about their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most of their wedding vendors. The fianc\u00e9's family friend recommended a videographer, but he's too expensive. The stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality for the photos and video. The author responds by stating that the budget is the issue and that they don't need input from strangers on how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The author is defending their right to make decisions for their wedding without unsolicited advice from strangers.\n2. The stranger's comment was a form of unsolicited advice, possibly pushing for higher quality despite the cost.\n3. The author's response was firm but polite, stating their budget constraints and that they don't need input from strangers.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette. People often feel that when they offer advice, especially on something as personal as a wedding, they are helping. However, the author has made it clear that they've already made decisions and don't need input. The stranger's comment was in response to the family friend's recommendation, but since they are a stranger, their input might be unwelcome.\n\nThe author's response is direct but not rude. They explain the budget issue and assert ownership over their wedding decisions. The stranger's message implied that the author's choice (not hiring the videographer) would result in a less meaningful experience, which the author correctly points out is not their concern. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their response was appropriate. They didn't attack the person personally, just stated their position. The stranger overstepped by making a judgment about the authors' decision, so the author's response is a reasonable boundary-setting. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
