I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding planning conflict on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 and they have most of the wedding booked. The mom is paying for things, and they were looking into a videographer suggested by a family friend. The friend's nephew is too expensive, so the author politely declined. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, comments on the post, pushing her opinion about the importance of quality in videography. The author responds defensively, saying they don't need input and that the wedding is theirs.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. The key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author felt that strangers shouldn't give unsolicited advice, especially since they were already making their own decisions. The stranger's comment came off as pushy and maybe offensive, implying that without their choice, the wedding would be subpar.\n\nThe author's response was a bit harsh, but they were defending their right to make their own decisions. It's common for people to get overwhelmed with advice from strangers, especially in situations like weddings where there's a lot of pressure. However, the author's reply was direct and perhaps a bit confrontational. Instead of just reiterating their budget, they accused the stranger of overstepping. But given the context, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. The stranger was not a close friend or family member, so her input was indeed unsolicited. The author's response, while maybe a bit strong, was a reaction to being told how to run their wedding. So, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were defending their autonomy. The stranger was the one who intruded with unnecessary advice. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
