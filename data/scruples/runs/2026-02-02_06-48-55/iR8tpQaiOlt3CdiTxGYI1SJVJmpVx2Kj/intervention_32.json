I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding the way they did to a stranger's comment about their wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has already booked most vendors, and the mom is paying. They were considering a videographer suggested by a family friend, but the nephew is too expensive. The author politely said he's out of budget. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about the importance of quality, implying that their choice might affect the lasting memories. The author responds by saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The stranger was a complete stranger, not a close relative or friend. The author was clearly annoyed with unsolicited advice. The key points are: the stranger gave unsolicited advice, the author was under pressure from others already, and the author was firm about their decision. \n\nOn one hand, the stranger might have been trying to advocate for her son's services, but the author had already made a decision and was firm. The author's response was direct but not necessarily harsh. The person might feel entitled to push for their son's business, but the author's right to control their wedding is valid. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author overstepped. The author was polite initially, then firm. The response was a bit confrontational, but given the context of being bombarded with unsolicited advice, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their autonomy. The stranger was being pushy without being asked, so the author had the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
