I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. The situation involves a family friend's nephew being recommended as a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declines, but then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about quality being important. The author responds firmly, saying they don't need a stranger's advice.\n\nFirst, the author's initial response to the family friend was polite, which is good. The stranger then chimes in, maybe trying to defend her son's business. The author's response was a bit harsh, using phrases like \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" That might come off as rude, even if they're frustrated. People often get defensive when their event is discussed, but the author did address the comment directly. \n\nHowever, the key points here are: the stranger was trying to push her son's services, and the author stood up for their decision. The author's comment about the wedding being \"OUR day\" is valid because they are the ones getting married. But the tone might be an issue. The stranger might not have intended to be pushy, but the author's response was defensive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's usually okay to decline recommendations, especially if they don't fit the budget. However, the author's response was a bit sharp. Maybe a more polite decline would have been better. But considering the author was already stressed about the wedding and dealing with family input, their reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. They were within their rights to make their own decisions and express that, but the way they did it might have been abrupt. The stranger was just trying to promote her son's business, which can be a sensitive area if it's family-related. The author's response could be seen as dismissive, but they have the right to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their autonomy over their wedding. They had the right to decline the recommendation, especially when it's outside their budget. The stranger overstepped by commenting, and the author was justified in pushing back. However, the tone could have been smoother. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions are defensible.\n"
