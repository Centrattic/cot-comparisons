I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nSo the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have most things booked, mom is paying. They don't really care about a videographer, but the author looked into it for the mom's sake. A family friend suggested her nephew, who's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about quality being important. The author responds firmly, saying they don't need strangers' input. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had every right to set boundaries. They were approached by a stranger on social media giving unsolicited advice. The initial response from the author was polite about the budget, and the stranger (the mom) overstepped by commenting further. The author's response was clear and respectful, stating their position without being rude. They emphasized that it's their day and they don't need input from strangers. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The stranger wasn't invited to give advice. The author's frustration with unsolicited input is valid. People often think they have the right to comment on weddings, but it's the couple's choice. The author's response was firm but not aggressive. They didn't attack the person, just stated their stance. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their right to make their own decisions without outside pressure. The stranger's comments were intrusive, and the author handled it by setting a boundary.\n"
