I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have most things booked. The author's mom is paying, but they're looking into a videographer. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The friend posted the nephew's page on the author's Facebook. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about quality being important. The author responds firmly, saying they don't need input and that it's their day. They feel the stranger was pushing, and they got defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the author is tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. The stranger commented on a public post, which the author might not have expected. The author's response was direct, but is that wrong?\n\nThe author's response was polite but firm. The stranger's comment could be seen as unsolicited and maybe even a bit condescending. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially since the wedding is their event. The author's mom is paying, but the author and fianc\u00e9 are the ones making the decisions. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter they're not involved in. The author's reply was a clear boundary, which is reasonable. People can get defensive when they feel their autonomy is being questioned, especially in a public forum. \n\nSo, the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their right to make decisions about their wedding without unsolicited input from strangers.\n"
