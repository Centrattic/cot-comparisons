I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after responding to a stranger's comment about their wedding videographer choice. The key points here are the context of the interaction and the appropriateness of the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 and they have already booked most of the major vendors, and the mother is covering the costs except for the rehearsal dinner. The mother asked the author to look into videographers, even though the couple isn't particularly interested. A family friend suggested her nephew, but he's too expensive. The author politely said so. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the post, arguing that quality is important and implying that not choosing her nephew would lead to a worse wedding experience.\n\nThe author's response was firm: stating the budget issue, emphasizing that it's their day, and not wanting input from strangers. The user is wondering if that was too harsh.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people often have strong opinions about weddings. However, the author had already addressed the budget concern. The stranger's comment seems pushy and possibly condescending, implying judgment. The author's reply was direct but not rude, as they were clear about their stance without attacking the person. It's reasonable to protect one's own decisions, especially from strangers. The author isn't obligated to accept unsolicited advice, especially when it's coming from someone not close to them. They were within their right to set boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
