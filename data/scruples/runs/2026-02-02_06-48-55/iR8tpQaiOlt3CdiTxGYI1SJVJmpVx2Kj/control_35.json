I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. So, the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author politely said he was out of budget. Then a stranger, who turned out to be the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality. The author responded by saying they don't need a stranger's advice and that it's their day.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong here. The key points are whether the author was rude or unnecessarily harsh. The stranger commented on the importance of the videographer's service, implying maybe the author should consider it. The author then replies, emphasizing that it's their day and they don't need input from strangers. \n\nThe initial interaction was the stranger pushing for a specific vendor after the author had already stated budget constraints. The author's response was to assert their right to make their own decisions. Facebook can be a public space, so the stranger might have overstepped by commenting on a personal matter. The author's reply, while direct, doesn't come across as overly rude. They thanked the person and then stated their position. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're already dealing with a lot of wedding planning and unsolicited advice. \n\nThe videographer's mom might have felt she was advocating for her son's business, but the author was within their right to set boundaries. The main issue is the stranger's initial intrusion into a personal decision. The author's response is a reasonable boundary. So, likely the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their autonomy in the situation."
