I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of the wedding booked. The author's mom is covering most costs, and they checked a videographer suggested by a family friend. The videographer is too expensive, so they politely declined. Then, the videographer's mom, a stranger, comments on the post saying quality is important and that photos (and presumably videos) last forever. The author responds firmly that the videographer is too expensive and that they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe author feels that the stranger is implying their wedding would be bad without the videographer. They're frustrated with strangers giving unsolicited advice.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the stranger's comment might have been a bit pushy, trying to sell their son's services. The author's response was direct, stating their budget constraints and asserting their right to make their own decisions. The author didn't attack the stranger personally, just set boundaries. They also mentioned they're tired of unsolicited input, which is valid. The response was polite but firm, and they didn't engage in a hostile way. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong here. The stranger was giving unwanted advice, and the author had the right to say no. So the answer is B.\n"
