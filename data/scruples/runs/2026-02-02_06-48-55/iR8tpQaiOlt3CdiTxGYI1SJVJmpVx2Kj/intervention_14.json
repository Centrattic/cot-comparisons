I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of the wedding booked. The author's mom is paying, and a family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented, emphasizing the importance of quality and that the photos/videography will last. The author responded by saying it's their day, they don't need strangers' opinions, and that if they choose someone else, the wedding won't be \"shit.\" The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's response was appropriate. The key points here are the author's right to make their own decisions versus the stranger's unsolicited advice. \n\nThe stranger's comment was about the importance of quality in videography, implying that the author's choice might affect the lasting memory. The author felt it was intrusive. However, the author's response was a bit confrontational, even though they were polite in the beginning. The phrase \"if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit\" is a bit harsh, even if it's implied. \n\nBut the author is clearly within their right to set boundaries. The stranger was overstepping by giving unsolicited advice. The author's frustration is understandable, as they were tired of strangers commenting on their wedding. The response, while maybe a bit snarky, was a way to assert their autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more respectful without being confrontational. However, the stranger's comment was itself unsolicited and possibly pushy, so the author's reaction isn't entirely out of line. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to decide how to handle their wedding and who to take advice from. The stranger's input was unwelcome, and the author was justified in setting that boundary, even if the response was a bit sharp. So the answer would be B.\n"
