I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding planning conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is getting married and has already booked most vendors. They were asked to look into videographers by their mom. A family friend suggested her nephew, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the post, pushing the idea that quality is important. The author responds by saying they don't need input and that it's their day. The author is defensive and a bit harsh, calling the stranger a \"random stranger\" and implying that the advice is unwanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The stranger, the videographer's mom, added a comment that might be seen as unsolicited advice. The author's response was to tell her she's not needed to comment on their wedding. The author feels entitled to control their own wedding, which is reasonable. However, the tone might be seen as rude. The key points here are: the stranger's comment was unsolicited, the author had the right to set their budget, and the response was firm but not overtly abusive. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable since they're already overwhelmed with wedding planning and dealing with unsolicited advice. The stranger's comment could be perceived as pushy, trying to upsell their son's services. The author's response was to assert their autonomy, which is valid. However, some might argue that even if the advice is unwanted, responding in a dismissive manner is unkind. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the author had already explained the budget issue, and the stranger continued to push\u2014responding firmly to set boundaries is not necessarily wrong. The author is within their rights to not accept unsolicited input, especially from someone they don't know. The response, while perhaps a bit harsh, is a common reaction to unwanted advice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to control their wedding and can set boundaries against unsolicited advice. The stranger overstepped by continuing to comment after the budget was mentioned, and the author's response was a reasonable boundary-setting action.\n"
