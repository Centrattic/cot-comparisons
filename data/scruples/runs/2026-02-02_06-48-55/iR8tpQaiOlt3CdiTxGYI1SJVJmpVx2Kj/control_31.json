I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (ITA or AITA). The situation is about a couple who are planning their wedding and getting unsolicited input from strangers.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most vendors. The mom is paying, and the author is looking into a videographer on their mom's request, even though they don't really want one. A family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely said so. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about quality being important because photos last forever. The author responded defensively, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is tired of strangers giving input. The stranger's comment was a pushy sales tactic disguised as advice. The author's response was direct but not rude, stating their budget and that they have the final say. They didn't attack the person, just stood their ground.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main factors are whether the person acted in a way that's unreasonable or overly harsh. The author had already made decisions, and the stranger was trying to upsell. The response was firm but polite. The author's frustration is understandable since they don't want unsolicited advice. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a post they weren't part of. The author's reply was a clear boundary setting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
