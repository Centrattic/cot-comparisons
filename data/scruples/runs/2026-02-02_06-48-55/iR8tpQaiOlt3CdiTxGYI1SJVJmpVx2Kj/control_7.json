I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already made most of their decisions. The author's mom asked them to look into a videographer, and a family friend suggested her nephew, who's too expensive. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented on the Facebook post, pushing for the quality of the videographer. The author responded by saying the budget is set and that strangers shouldn't dictate how they run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overstepped. The author was polite when initially declining the suggestion from the family friend. Then a stranger inserted herself into the conversation, making a comment that the author found intrusive. The author's response was direct and explained their stance, but maybe a bit harsh? The key points are whether the author was rude or if they were justified in pushing back against unsolicited advice.\n\nThe stranger's comment seems to be implying that the videographer they suggested is necessary for quality, which the author found pushy. The author's response was firm but not necessarily aggressive. They clarified their budget and their right to make their own decisions. The author felt tired of unsolicited input, which is understandable. In terms of social norms, while it's generally good to be polite, standing up for one's decisions, especially when others are being pushy, can be seen as justified. The author didn't attack the person but stated their position. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were defending their autonomy against a stranger's unsolicited advice. However, maybe the tone was a bit harsh, but given the context, it's a reasonable reaction.\n"
