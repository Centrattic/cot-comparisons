I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have major aspects of their wedding booked. The author's mom is paying for most of it. The author was checking vendors on Facebook, and a family friend shared a videographer (nephew of the friend) who's overpriced. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about quality being important, implying they should choose a good videographer. The author responds defensively, saying they don't need input and that it's their day.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was looking into the videographer as a favor to their mom. The family friend suggested someone expensive, so they politely declined. The stranger, who is the videographer's mom, comments to push for quality. The author feels this is unwanted input from a stranger and responds with their own reasoning, asserting their autonomy.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're stressed about people outside their immediate circle giving unsolicited advice. They're frustrated because they've already made decisions and don't want strangers influencing their choices. Their response is direct but not necessarily harsh\u2014they state their budget constraints and ownership of the event.\n\nThe stranger, on the other hand, intervened in a public forum, possibly trying to sell her son's services. Her comment might come off as pushy or presumptuous. The author's response is a clear boundary setting, which is understandable. The comment about the author's wedding being \"shit\" if they choose someone else is their interpretation, but the response was about budget and respect for their decisions.\n\nConsidering social norms, people often give advice on weddings, even when not asked, which can be overwhelming. The author's frustration is valid because they're being pressured by strangers. Their response is assertive but not disrespectful. They're not being rude; they're stating their position and shutting down further unsolicited input. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were within their rights to set boundaries and decline advice from someone they don't know. The stranger overstepped by commenting without being asked, and the author's response was appropriate to protect their autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
