I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. The scenario involves the user and their fianc\u00e9 planning their wedding, with the mother covering most costs. They looked into a videographer suggested by a family friend, but found the price too high. The family friend posted the videographer's page on the user's Facebook. Then a random stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality.\n\nThe user responds by saying the price is still out of budget and that it's their day, not wanting input from strangers. They feel the stranger was pushing the videographer and that the comment was implying that without this videographer, the wedding would be bad. The user is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, first, the stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the post, which was initiated by a family friend. The user didn't ask for the suggestion, but since the post was on their personal Facebook, maybe the stranger saw it through that. The user's response was direct but polite? They said it's out of budget and that they don't need input. The user feels justified because they don't want unsolicited advice, especially from strangers. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the stranger did make a comment that could be seen as pushing their service, and the user was defending their own decision. The user's response was firm but not necessarily rude. They didn't attack the person, just stated their stance. On the other hand, the stranger might have felt their input was just advice, but the user didn't appreciate it. \n\nIn social situations, people often give advice even when not asked, but the user has the right to set boundaries. Since the user is not obligated to accept unsolicited opinions, especially from someone they don't know, their response was probably appropriate. The key point is that the user was clear and respectful in stating their position without being confrontational. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
