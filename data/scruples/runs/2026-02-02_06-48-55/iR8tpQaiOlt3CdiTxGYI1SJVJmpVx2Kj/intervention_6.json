I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding vendors booked. The author's mom is paying, and the fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer from her nephew, which was too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality and the lasting value of photos. The author responded by saying the budget is the issue, that it's their day, and they don't want strangers telling them how to run it. They felt the stranger was implying their wedding would be bad if they didn't choose the suggested videographer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They've already made decisions, the budget is a constraint, and they're tired of unsolicited advice. The stranger's comment might have come off as pushy or dismissive of their choice. The author's response was direct, stating their position and setting boundaries. They might feel justified in protecting their autonomy over the wedding.\n\nFrom the stranger's perspective: She's defending her son's business and trying to highlight the value of quality. However, since it's a stranger, her comment might be seen as overstepping. She didn't know the couple's budget or preferences, so pushing her son's services could be intrusive.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author was polite when declining the friend's suggestion but then received a comment from a stranger that felt like pressure. The author's response was firm, emphasizing their right to make their own choices. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to evaluate if the author's response was appropriate. The author didn't attack the stranger personally; they clarified their stance and set a boundary. The stranger's comment could be interpreted as implying the author's choice is inferior, which might be why the author felt defensive. \n\nIn social interactions, people often give advice expecting it to be accepted, but it's not their responsibility. The author had every right to state their position. However, the tone of the response might have been harsh. The phrase \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" could come off as dismissive or confrontational, even if the intent was to set a boundary.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014unsolicited advice from a stranger, the author was within their rights to decline further input. The core issue is that the stranger overstepped, so the author's response was a reaction to that overstepping. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they're protecting their decision-making autonomy and were within their right to set boundaries. However, the response could have been more tactful. But since the stranger initiated the unsolicited advice, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
