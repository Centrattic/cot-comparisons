I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that a family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The person politely declined. Then a random stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about quality being important. The author responds by saying the budget is out of reach and that it's their day, and they don't need strangers to tell them how to run it.\n\nFirst, the stranger wasn't a family member or friend. She just jumped into the conversation on Facebook. The author had already addressed the family friend's suggestion, so the stranger's comment was unexpected. The author's response was firm but maybe a bit harsh. They felt that the stranger was implying their wedding would be bad if they didn't hire the videographer. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries. The couple isn't obligated to take advice from strangers. The stranger's comment could be seen as intrusive. The author's response might come off as rude, but the context is that they're dealing with unsolicited advice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has the right to set boundaries around their personal event. However, the tone of their response might be seen as dismissive. But considering the stranger was pushing for a specific vendor, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their space from unsolicited input. The stranger overstepped, and the author responded appropriately, even if it was a bit strong. So the answer would be B.\n"
