I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most major vendors, and a family friend suggested a videographer who's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, who is the videographer's mom, commented on the post saying quality is most important and that photos (and by extension videos) last forever. The author responded by saying the person is a stranger and that they don't need the input, even implying that the comment makes them think the wedding will be \"shit\" if they don't take the suggestion.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the details. The author had already explained budget concerns, and the stranger added unsolicited advice. The author's response was defensive and dismissive. But is that wrong? Well, the stranger was intruding on a private discussion, which the author had a right to be upset about. However, the author's tone might have been harsh. Instead of being rude, maybe a more neutral response would have been better. But the stranger was being pushy after the author had already declined. The author's fianc\u00e9 and family are involved in decisions, and the author is tired of strangers' opinions. So, the author's response was a bit blunt but perhaps justified given the prior interaction. The key is that the author was firm yet polite in declining, and the stranger overstepped. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
