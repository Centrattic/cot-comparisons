I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author and fianc\u00e9 have most things booked, and a family friend suggested a videographer. The author found him too expensive and told the friend. Then a stranger, who turned out to be the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality. The author responded defensively, saying it's their day and they don't want input from strangers.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that strangers are offering unsolicited advice. The key points here are the boundaries the author is trying to set. The stranger's comment was pushy and possibly trying to upsell the videographer. The author's response was firm but polite, stating their budget limitations and that it's their day. \n\nThe author's mom was the one who wanted a videographer, so the author was considering it, but the fianc\u00e9 and author aren't too keen. The stranger's comment might have been an attempt to sway them by implying that without their son's service, the wedding would be bad, which the author took that way.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They've set their boundaries, and the stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter. The author's response was direct but respectful, just stating their position. People should be able to decline unsolicited advice without being in the wrong, especially when it's from someone they don't know. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
