I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation involves the author's mom paying for the wedding except the rehearsal dinner, and a family friend suggesting a videographer. The author found the suggested videographer too expensive and mentioned it. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the post, emphasizing the importance of quality for the photos and video. The author responded by saying the stranger shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding and that the most important thing is their day. The user thinks the author might be wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, the stranger's comment was unsolicited advice. The author had already stated the budget issue, and the stranger's response was pushing for a higher quality option. The author's reply was defensive and dismissive, which might come off as rude. However, the stranger was not a family member or close friend but a complete stranger. People might feel entitled when their child is involved, but the author has the right to set their own priorities. The key here is whether responding in that way to a stranger is inconsiderate. The author's main point is that their wedding is their own, and they don't need strangers' input. While the response was a bit harsh, the context of being a stranger and the author's right to control their event might justify it. So, the answer is B for No. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to engage with strangers' advice, especially when it's about personal choices and budget constraints.\n"
