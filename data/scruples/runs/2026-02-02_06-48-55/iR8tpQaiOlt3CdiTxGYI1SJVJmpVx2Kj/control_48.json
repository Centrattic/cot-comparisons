I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9 had most of their wedding plans already set. The author's mom wanted them to look into a videographer, so they did. A family friend suggested her nephew, who's too expensive. The author told the friend that. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented on the post saying quality is most important and that photos/videography last longer. The author responded by saying the videographer is still too expensive and that strangers shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author had already said the vendor was out of budget. The stranger (videographer's mom) was probably trying to push her son's services by emphasizing the importance of videography. The author felt it was unnecessary input from someone they don't know. \n\nWeddings are personal, and it's common for couples to get unsolicited advice. The author's frustration with strangers giving input seems valid. They had already addressed the initial suggestion, and the mom's comment came off as pushy or trying to guilt-trip them. The author's response was firm but polite, stating their budget constraints and that it's their day. \n\nThe key points here: the author was within their right to set boundaries. The stranger wasn't a close family member or a close friend, so her input isn't expected to be taken seriously. The author's comment wasn't rude; they thanked her and made it clear they've made their decision. The stranger might have overstepped by commenting in the first place. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The stranger initiated the unsolicited advice, and the author had every right to push back. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
