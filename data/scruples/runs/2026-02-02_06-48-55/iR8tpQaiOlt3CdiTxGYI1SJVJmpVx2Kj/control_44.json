I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author responding to a stranger's comment on a Facebook post about a videographer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have already planned most of the wedding. The mother is covering most costs, and they were looking into a videographer as a favor to the mother. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The author politely said he's out of budget. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about quality being important and mentions that photos/videography last forever. The author responds by saying the budget is the issue and they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider social norms here. The author was polite initially when the family friend suggested the videographer. The stranger (the mom) then added unsolicited advice. The author's response was firm but not rude. They explained their stance and set boundaries. \n\nThe question is about whether the author overreacted. The author was frustrated with strangers giving input. Their response was direct but not aggressive. They didn't attack the person, just stated their position. The stranger's comment could be seen as pushy, implying that using her son is necessary for a good wedding. The author's response defends their right to make their own choices.\n\nIn many social situations, people do get unsolicited advice, especially for events like weddings. It's common for people to feel overwhelmed. The author's response seems reasonable because they clearly communicated their budget constraints and didn't want unsolicited input. The stranger overstepped by giving advice, and the author was within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author was defending their autonomy in planning their wedding and didn't respond with hostility. The stranger initiated the unsolicited comment, so the author's response was justified.\n"
