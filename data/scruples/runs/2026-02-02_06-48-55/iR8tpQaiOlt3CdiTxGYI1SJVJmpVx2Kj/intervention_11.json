I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding the way they did to a stranger's comment about their wedding. The situation is that the author, along with their fianc\u00e9, has already made most of the major decisions for their wedding. The fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, who was too expensive, so the author politely declined. Then, the stranger (videographer's mom) commented on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality over cost. The author responded by saying that the videographer is still out of budget and that they don't need strangers to dictate how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was on Facebook looking for vendors, a family friend suggested a vendor, which was too expensive, then a stranger (the vendor's mom) commented, and the author responded with a defensive comment. The author is now asking if they were in the wrong for that response.\n\nFirst, the author had already made decisions about most of the vendors, and the videographer was being suggested by a family friend. The author's mom wanted them to consider the videographer, but the author and fianc\u00e9 didn't really care about it. So the author is within their right to ignore or reject the suggestion if it's out of their budget. \n\nThe stranger (videographer's mom) chimed in, which the author found intrusive. The author's response was to point out the budget issue and assert that it's their day. The author feels that the stranger was implying that choosing someone else would make the wedding bad, which the author found offensive.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, strangers giving unsolicited advice can be annoying, especially when it's about a personal event like a wedding. The author's response was direct but polite, stating their budget concerns and asserting their autonomy. However, the response might come off as a bit confrontational, especially the part about \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" But considering the context, the author is defending their decision and setting boundaries. The stranger's comment could be seen as pushing for their own vendor, possibly for commission or to benefit their son's business. \n\nThe author's main issue is with strangers giving input, which they felt was unnecessary. The response was a clear boundary, so they're not in the wrong. The stranger initiated the unsolicited advice, so the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
