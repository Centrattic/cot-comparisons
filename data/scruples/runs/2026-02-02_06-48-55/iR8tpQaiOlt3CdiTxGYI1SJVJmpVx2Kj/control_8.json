I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has already booked most vendors, and the author's mom is covering costs. A family friend suggested a videographer, which was too expensive. Then a complete stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on a Facebook post saying quality is most important, implying the chosen vendor is necessary. The author responded firmly that they don't need input from strangers and mentioned their budget constraints.\n\nSo, the main points here are boundaries and privacy. The author is frustrated with unsolicited advice from people they don't know. The stranger's comment came off as pushy, perhaps trying to upsell their son's services. The author's response was direct but polite, asserting their right to make their own decisions.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have the right to set boundaries. The stranger's comment was intrusive and possibly manipulative. The author's response was appropriate in defending their autonomy. They didn't respond with hostility but clearly stated their position. The person who gave the comment was a stranger, so the author isn't obligated to engage further. The fact that the videographer's mom was pushing her own service adds another layer, as it's not just advice but a potential sales pitch.\n\nIn social situations, people often overstep by giving unsolicited opinions, especially on personal matters like weddings. The author's reaction is understandable given the frustration. They are not in the wrong for protecting their personal decisions and not accepting unwanted input. The answer should be B, No.\n"
