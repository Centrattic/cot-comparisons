I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a random stranger (the videographer's mom) commented, emphasizing the importance of quality. The author responded strongly, saying they don't need strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction was justified. The key points here: the author was already handling the vendor search, had set a budget, and was polite in declining the initial suggestion. The stranger's comment could be seen as pushy, trying to upsell or convince them despite the budget constraints. The author's response was defensive, which might come off as rude, but maybe it's understandable given the frustration. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author isn't. People often get annoyed with unsolicited advice, especially from strangers. The author had the right to set boundaries. However, their response was a bit harsh. The stranger might have been trying to advocate for her son's business, but the author had the right to decline. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were within their rights to tell the stranger to stop giving advice. The answer is B.\n"
