I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They described a situation where they got a comment from a stranger, the videographer's mom, pushing for quality over budget. The author responded firmly, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nFirst, the stranger commented on a Facebook post, which was shared by the family friend's nephew's page. The author was within their rights to comment on their own FB post. The stranger's comment was unsolicited advice, and the author's response was to assert their autonomy. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The comment was from a stranger, 2) The advice was unsolicited, 3) The author's response was a polite but firm boundary. \n\nI think the author is justified because they were setting a boundary against unwanted input. The stranger overstepped by commenting on their personal event, so the author defending their decision isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
