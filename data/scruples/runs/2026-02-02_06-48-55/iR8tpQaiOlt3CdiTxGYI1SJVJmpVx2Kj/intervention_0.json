I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning a wedding, and the fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely said he's out of budget. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the Facebook post, pushing the importance of quality. The author responds strongly, saying they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding. The author feels justified because they're tired of unsolicited advice from strangers.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they might be, but the answer could go either way. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the stranger was a videographer's mom. She commented on a public post, possibly trying to push her son's services. The author had already said the price was too high, so the mom's response might have been a sales pitch. The author's response could be seen as defensive or abrupt. The author says they took the mom's comment as implying their wedding would be bad if they chose someone else, which led to their harsh reply.\n\nBut wait, the author had a right to be firm about their budget. The mom's comment might have been over the line, coming off as pushy. The author's response was direct, but maybe they could have handled it more politely. However, the author was responding to someone who wasn't a close friend or family, just a stranger. The author's frustration is understandable since they're dealing with a lot of wedding planning and unsolicited advice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reply was a bit confrontational. They used \"random stranger\" and \"how to run OUR wedding,\" which might have been a bit harsh. But considering the context, maybe it's justified. The mom's comment was unsolicited after the author had already declined the service based on price. The author's main point was to assert their control over the wedding decisions, which is their right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were clear about their budget and their decision, which is reasonable. Reacting strongly to the mom's pushy comment might be understandable. The key here is that the stranger was pushing a service that was already deemed too expensive, so the author's response was a boundary-setting. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
