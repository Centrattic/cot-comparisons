I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a stranger's input about their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned, with the mom covering most costs. They were looking at a videographer suggested by a family friend, but it's too expensive. The friend posted the videographer's page on the author's Facebook. Then a random stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality. The author responds strongly, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was polite when initially told about the videographer's high cost. Then a stranger (the mom) gives unsolicited advice. The author's response was defensive and a bit harsh. The question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nHmm. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own wedding. They've already made clear their budget constraints, so the stranger's comment might be seen as intrusive. However, the author's response was a bit confrontational. They said the stranger is telling them how to run their wedding and dismissed the advice. But the stranger was just emphasizing the importance of quality, maybe in a well-meaning way, even if it was unsolicited.\n\nBut considering the context, the author has every right to be firm about their decisions. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter. The author's response, while perhaps a bit terse, is a valid assertion of their autonomy. The main issue is that the stranger was not invited to give advice in the first place. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their space. They were within their rights to decline further input. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
