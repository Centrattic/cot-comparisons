I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is about a person telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nSo, the author's fianc\u00e9 and they have already booked most vendors. The mother asked to look into videographers, but they don't really care. The family friend suggested her nephew's service, which is too expensive. Then the friend's mother (a stranger) comments on the Facebook post, arguing that quality is important. The author responds politely but firmly that they don't need input and that it's their day. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, the stranger's comment seems to be unsolicited advice. The author was already polite when rejecting the family friend's suggestion. The stranger then continues to push, implying that choosing a cheaper option would make the wedding worse. The author's response is to assert their right to decide their own priorities. \n\nIs the author wrong for standing up for their own decisions? The stranger was being pushy. The author had the right to set boundaries. They were polite but clear. The author's frustration with strangers giving unsolicited advice is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
