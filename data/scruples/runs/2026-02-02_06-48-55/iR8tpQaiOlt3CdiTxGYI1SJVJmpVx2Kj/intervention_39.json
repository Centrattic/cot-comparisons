I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who have most of their wedding planned, especially with the mom covering most of the costs. They don't really care about a videographer but are considering one for the mom. A family friend suggests her nephew, who is too expensive, and the couple politely declines. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on Facebook pushing for quality, implying they should get the videographer. The author responds strongly, saying they don't need strangers' input.\n\nFirst, the author's response was a bit harsh. They said something like \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" The key here is the tone and the way they dismissed the stranger's input. However, the context is that the couple was already overwhelmed with unsolicited advice and had already made decisions. The stranger's comment might have been well-intentioned but inappropriate, as it's not her place to give advice on their wedding. The author's frustration is understandable because they were dealing with a lot of input from people they don't know. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was a bit confrontational. Instead of just stating their budget constraints again, they made a pointed comment about the stranger not needing to tell them how to run their day. That could be seen as rude. But considering the context of repeated unsolicited advice and the stress of planning a wedding, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I have to weigh the pros and cons. The author had the right to set boundaries, especially with strangers commenting on personal decisions. However, the way they communicated that boundary was harsh. The stranger's comment was intrusive, so the author's response might be a valid reaction to being pushed. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the response was appropriate given the situation. The author was defending their autonomy in their own wedding, which is a big deal. The stranger overstepped by inserting herself into the couple's planning. The author's reply, while a bit sharp, was a way to set a boundary. So, in this case, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their personal space. The stranger initiated the inappropriate comment, so the author's response is a justified reaction to the intrusion.\n"
