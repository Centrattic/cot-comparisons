I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most of the major vendors. The mom is covering most costs except the rehearsal dinner. The author was asked by the fianc\u00e9's mom to look into videographers. A family friend suggested a nephew who's too expensive, so the author politely declined. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality, implying they should choose this videographer. The author responded strongly, saying it's their day and they don't want strangers telling them how to run it.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author was already polite when declining the family friend's suggestion. The stranger's comment comes off as unsolicited advice, which the author found intrusive. The author's response was firm but justified given the situation. They were defending their right to make their own choices. The stranger wasn't a family member or close friend, so her input is indeed a random comment. The author's frustration is valid because they're overwhelmed with unsolicited input. Their reply was direct but not overly harsh, just setting a boundary. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
