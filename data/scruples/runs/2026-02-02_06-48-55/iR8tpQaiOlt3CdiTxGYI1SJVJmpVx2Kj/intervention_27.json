I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The main points are that the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most vendors, their mom is covering most costs, and a family friend suggested a videographer (the nephew) who's way over the budget. The friend's mom, a stranger, commented on the Facebook post trying to push the idea, and the author responded sharply, saying they don't need a stranger's advice.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions and the response. The author was polite when initially told by the family friend. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) added a comment, which the author found unwelcome. The author's response was \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\" They felt the stranger's comment was implying that if they didn't choose the suggested videographer, their wedding would be bad. The author is frustrated with strangers giving unsolicited advice.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the community's take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nSo, is the author right to respond that way? Let's break it down. The stranger's comment was in the form of unsolicited advice. The author had already explained the budget issue. The stranger's comment might have come off as pushy or assuming the couple's priorities. The author's response was firm but not necessarily rude. They mentioned the budget again and asserted their right to make their own decisions. \n\nIn many discussions about AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key points are about respect and boundaries. The author was clear about their budget and the fact that they had already made most decisions. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter without being asked. The author's response was a polite but firm boundary setting, which is acceptable. \n\nHowever, the tone of the author's comment might be seen as a bit harsh, even if they are polite. Phrases like \"random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" could be interpreted as dismissive. But given the context, the author is justified in being firm with someone who's not close to them. The stranger's comment was intrusive, and the author had the right to close the conversation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to set boundaries, especially since the advice was unsolicited and from a stranger. The response was a reasonable way to end the interaction without being offensive. So answer B.\n"
