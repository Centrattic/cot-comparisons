I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation involves the author's mother-in-law's family friend suggesting a videographer, which was too expensive. The author's comment was that the stranger shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. It's common for people to get unsolicited advice, especially for big events like weddings. The stranger was a videographer's mom, so she might have a vested interest in promoting her son's services. The author's response was direct and firm, which is understandable if they're fed up with strangers giving input. \n\nHowever, the tone of the author's comment might have been a bit harsh. They interpreted the stranger's message as implying that choosing someone else would make their wedding \"shit,\" which might not have been the stranger's intention. But the stranger did push for the quality argument, which could be seen as dismissive of the couple's budget constraints.\n\nThe author's main point is about autonomy in their wedding. They've already made most decisions, and the stranger's comment felt intrusive. In that case, standing up for their decision is reasonable. The key factors here are whether the author's response was proportionate and if they crossed a line in their reply.\n\nThe author's comment was polite but firm, stating their budget and that it's their day. They didn't attack the person personally but set a boundary. That seems justified, especially since the input was unsolicited and came from a stranger. People often get defensive when their personal choices are challenged, especially in public forums like Facebook.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to assert their preferences and budget. The stranger overstepped by giving unsolicited advice, and the author's response was appropriate to set a boundary.\n"
