I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author rejected the suggestion, and then the videographer's mom, who's a stranger, commented about the importance of quality. The author responded by saying they don't need input from strangers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had already made most decisions, and the budget is a key factor. The stranger's comment did come off as unsolicited advice, especially after the initial rejection. The author's response was firm but not harsh, stating the budget issue and their right to decide. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the appropriateness of their response. The stranger's comment might be seen as pushy, so the author's pushback is a reaction to unwanted advice. However, the tone of the response could be seen as dismissive. The key points are: the author had the right to make their own decisions, the stranger was overstepping, and the response was a boundary setting.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have been more polite. But given that it's a stranger and they've already rejected the suggestion, the author's stance is about asserting their autonomy. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
