I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has already booked most vendors, and the mom is paying. A family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, who's the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality. The author responds with a strong statement about not needing strangers to dictate their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author was approached by a stranger, the stranger pushed for the videographer after being told it's too expensive, and the author reacted defensively. \n\nThe author's response was a bit harsh, but they were trying to set boundaries. The stranger's comment was unsolicited advice, maybe with a sales pitch. The author's frustration is understandable because they don't want unsolicited input, especially from strangers. However, the way they responded might come off as rude. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the author's main issue was someone else overstepping. The stranger's comment was intrusive, so the author's defense of their autonomy is valid. The harshness of the reply might be an issue, but the core of the situation is about boundaries. The author is not in the wrong for asserting their right to make their own decisions without outside interference. The answer should be B.\n"
