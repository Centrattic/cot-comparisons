I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author politely declined, but then the videographer's mom, a stranger, commented about the quality being important. The author responded firmly, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nSo, first, the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author was already dealing with someone they know (the family friend) suggesting a vendor, which they declined. Then, the videographer's mom, a stranger, added a comment trying to push the value of quality. The author felt that this stranger was overstepping and responded in a way that was clear but maybe a bit harsh.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author has already made decisions on vendors and has a budget. The mom's comment seems to be an attempt to upsell or justify the higher cost. The author's response was to assert their autonomy, which is understandable because planning a wedding involves many decisions, and unsolicited advice can be overwhelming, especially from strangers.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The person commenting was a stranger, 2) The author had already declined the suggestion, 3) The author was firm about their budget and preferences. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's response was direct but not necessarily rude. They didn't attack the person personally but stated their position clearly. The stranger's comment might have been perceived as pushy or trying to influence the decision after the author had already declined. So, the author's reaction is a defense of their right to make their own choices without external pressure, especially when it's a personal event.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and make decisions about their own wedding without unsolicited input from strangers, even if the input is well-intentioned.\n"
