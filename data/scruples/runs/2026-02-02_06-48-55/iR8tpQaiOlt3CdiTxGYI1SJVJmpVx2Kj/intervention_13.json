I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after responding to a stranger's comment about their wedding vendor choices. \n\nFirst, the author was on Facebook looking for vendors, and a family friend posted a videographer's page. The author politely declined because the price was too high. Then a stranger, who turned out to be the videographer's mom, responded with a comment about quality being important. The author felt this was unsolicited advice and replied defensively, saying they don't need input and that it's their day.\n\nThe key points here are the context and the nature of the interaction. The author had already been approached by the family friend, which is understandable since it's a family connection. But the stranger (the videographer's mom) chimed in, which the author found intrusive. The author's response was firm, stating their budget constraints and asserting their right to make their own decisions.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people often get advice from unexpected places, but when it's unsolicited and from a stranger, it can be seen as overstepping. The author's frustration is valid because they're dealing with strangers giving unsolicited opinions. However, their response was direct and a bit confrontational. They called the stranger a \"random stranger\" and dismissed their input, which might be seen as harsh, even if the stranger's comment was pushy.\n\nOn the other hand, the stranger's initial comment was about the importance of quality, implying that choosing someone else might compromise the wedding's memory. That could be perceived as condescending or trying to pressure the couple into a more expensive option. The author's response was to assert their control over the wedding day, which is their right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The stranger initiated the unwanted advice, but the author's response was a bit aggressive. However, considering the context of repeated unsolicited input and the author's clear communication of their budget constraints, their reaction might be justified as a defense of their autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong here, especially since they were polite initially and only became firm after the stranger's pushy comment. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The author explained their position clearly and didn't engage in personal attacks beyond stating their stance. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
