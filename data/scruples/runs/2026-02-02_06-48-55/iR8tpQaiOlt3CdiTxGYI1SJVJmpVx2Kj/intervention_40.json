I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning their wedding and a stranger (the videographer's mom) commenting on their Facebook post. The author's response was pretty strong, so I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the couple had already made decisions on most vendors. The mom asked to look into a videographer, so the fianc\u00e9 did. The family friend suggested her nephew, who was too expensive. The author politely said he's over the budget. Then a stranger (the nephew's mom) jumped in with a comment about quality being important. The author responded by saying they don't need input from strangers, emphasizing their day is their own.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks they are in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They're stressed about wedding planning, dealing with family and friends' suggestions. The stranger's comment came off as pushy, implying that if they don't hire the recommended vendor, their wedding experience will be subpar. The author felt entitled to set boundaries, especially since the wedding is their personal event. The response was direct but firm, which might be seen as rude, but given the context of unwanted input, maybe justified.\n\nFrom the other side: The stranger's comment was trying to advocate for her son's business, suggesting quality matters. However, it's not polite to push someone into a decision, especially when they've already stated budget constraints. The author's response was assertive but not overly aggressive. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being dismissive of the stranger's input. \n\nIn social situations, it's common to feel defensive when personal choices are challenged, especially by strangers. The author's main point was that the wedding is their day, so they don't need unsolicited advice. While the tone of the response might have been a bit sharp, it's a valid stance. The stranger's comment was intrusive, so the author's reaction to set a boundary is understandable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to express their preference and set limits, especially when the advice came from someone not close to them. The stranger's comment was not helpful and was more of a sales pitch disguised as advice. The author's response was a reasonable assertion of their autonomy in planning their wedding. So the answer should be B.\n"
