I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The scenario is that a family friend suggested a videographer, and the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend's mom (a stranger) commented on the Facebook post, pushing for the videographer. The author responded by saying they don't need the stranger's input.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they're tired of strangers commenting on their wedding. They had already made decisions on most vendors, and the videographer was being suggested by a family friend, but the author found the cost too high. The stranger (the videographer's mom) then commented, emphasizing the importance of quality in videography. The author replied by stating their budget constraints and that it's their day, not wanting strangers to dictate it.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they were in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nTo evaluate, I need to consider the context. The author had already declined the videographer due to budget, which is a valid reason. The stranger's comment seems to be an unsolicited suggestion, possibly trying to push her son's services. The author's response was firm but polite, stating their position. The author's frustration is understandable because they're already stressed about the wedding and dealing with input from non-close friends.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was within their right to set boundaries. They didn't have to engage with the stranger, but they did so politely. The stranger was overstepping by giving unsolicited advice. The author's response was a clear boundary, which is appropriate. There's no indication of rudeness beyond stating their position. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were asserting their right to make their own decisions without unsolicited input.\n"
