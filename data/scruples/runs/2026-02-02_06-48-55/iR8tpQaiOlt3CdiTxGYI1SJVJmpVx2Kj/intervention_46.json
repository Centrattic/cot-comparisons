I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where they've already booked most vendors, and a family friend's relative is a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author's mom asked them to look into videographers, so they did. Then, after the author politely said the price was too high, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about quality being the most important. The author responded by saying they don't need input from strangers.\n\nFirst, the author did what's reasonable: they checked out the recommended videographer but found him too expensive. Then, when the stranger (who is related to the vendor) pushed back, the author stood their ground. The author's response was a bit strong, but maybe justified because they're defending their own decision. The stranger wasn't a close friend or family, so her input might be unwelcome. The author is also tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reply was a bit harsh. They said the stranger shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding. But considering the context\u2014they already made decisions, and the stranger was pushing a service they didn't really want\u2014maybe it's understandable. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. The stranger shouldn't have intruded, but the author's response, while assertive, wasn't necessarily wrong. They were defending their autonomy. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
