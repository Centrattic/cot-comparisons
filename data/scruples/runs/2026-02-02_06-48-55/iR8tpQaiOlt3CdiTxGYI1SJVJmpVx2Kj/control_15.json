I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that a family friend's nephew is a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author's mom wanted them to look into it, so they did. Then, a complete stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the Facebook post, pushing the idea that quality is most important. The author responded by saying the price is an issue and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, the author's mom asked them to look into the videographer, but the couple doesn't really care about it. They already have most things booked. The stranger's comment seems to imply that the videographer is necessary for capturing memories, but the author is within their rights to prioritize their budget. The author's response was a bit strong, but they were defending their autonomy. \n\nThe key points here are that the stranger was essentially promoting her nephew's services in a way that felt pushy, and the author was asserting their right to make their own decisions. While the tone of the response might be a bit harsh, the situation involved a stranger overstepping by giving unsolicited advice. The author isn't wrong to set boundaries. They've already made most decisions, and the stranger's input wasn't helpful but rather intrusive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They were protecting their personal event from unsolicited opinions, which is reasonable.\n"
