I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to a stranger's comment about their wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has already made most of their wedding decisions, and the mom is covering the costs. A family friend suggested a videographer, which the author found too expensive. The friend posted it on Facebook. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about the importance of quality for the photos and video. The author responds by saying the videographer is out of their budget and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was polite initially when declining the friend's suggestion. Then the stranger (videographer's mom) chimes in, possibly trying to upsell or push her son's services. The author's response is a bit defensive and dismissive, mentioning that the wedding is their day and they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The stranger's comment could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author had already said the cost was too high. The mom might be trying to defend her son's work or value, but inserting herself into a private conversation on Facebook as a stranger is probably not appropriate. \n\nThe author's response, while maybe a bit harsh, is a reaction to unsolicited advice from a stranger. The author's main point is about budget and autonomy. The question is whether it's wrong to push back against a stranger's unsolicited input. \n\nIn many cases, people get upset when strangers offer unsolicited advice, especially for personal events like weddings. The author's frustration is understandable, given the time and stress weddings involve. However, the author's comment about the stranger telling them how to run their wedding could come off as rude. \n\nBut considering the context, the stranger was part of a chain where a family friend suggested a vendor, and the mom then weighed in. The author's response was a direct reply to the mom's comment, which was in a public Facebook post. The author had already set their position on the budget, so the mom's comment was likely an attempt to persuade them further, which the author found intrusive.\n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their decision and setting boundaries. The stranger was the one who added unsolicited advice, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
