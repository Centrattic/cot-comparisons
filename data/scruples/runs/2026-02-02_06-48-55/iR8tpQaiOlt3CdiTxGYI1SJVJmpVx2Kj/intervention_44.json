I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, which was too expensive. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality, implying that the chosen vendor is necessary. The author responded by saying it's their day and they don't need strangers' input.\n\nFirst, the author had already made decisions on major vendors, and the videographer was being pushed by someone they don't know. The stranger's comment seems to be trying to pressure them into choosing the more expensive option, which the author is against. The author's response is firm but polite, stating their budget constraints and that they don't need unsolicited advice.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was within their right to set their own budget, the stranger was overstepping by commenting on a personal event, and the author's response was direct but respectful. The author's frustration is understandable given the unsolicited input. The stranger's comment can be seen as intrusive, and the author's defense of their autonomy is justified. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to control their wedding planning without interference from strangers.\n"
