I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning a wedding, and they're getting unsolicited advice from strangers.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author told the friend that he's out of budget. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented pushing the importance of quality. The author responded strongly, saying they don't need input and that it's their day.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author mentioned they're tired of strangers giving advice. The response was defensive and maybe a bit harsh. The stranger was responding to the friend's post, so maybe she felt she was helping. The author's reply was direct and dismissive, which could be seen as rude, but the stranger was a complete stranger giving unsolicited advice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They had a right to state their budget and preferences. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal matter where they weren't asked. The author's response was justified in setting boundaries. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
