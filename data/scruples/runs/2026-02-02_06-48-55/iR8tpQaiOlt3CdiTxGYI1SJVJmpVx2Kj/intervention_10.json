I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a stranger's comment about their wedding. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 making decisions about vendors, and a family friend's nephew (a videographer) being suggested. The author declines because of the budget. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on Facebook about the importance of quality, and the author responds by saying they don't need strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they're tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. They already have everything booked except the videographer, and they're trying to stick to their budget. The stranger's comment was probably meant to be supportive but came off as pushy. The author's response was direct and a bit defensive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Facebook is a public space, so others can comment on public posts. The author's initial response was polite, but the stranger continued. The author then became more assertive. The response \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\" is a bit harsh, especially calling the person a \"random stranger,\" which might be a bit dismissive.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is valid. They've made their decision and don't need unsolicited advice. The stranger overstepped by giving input without being asked. The author's response is a way to set a boundary, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the tone of the author's reply could be seen as rude. They didn't just ignore the comment but publicly called out the person as a stranger. It's possible that a more polite response could have maintained the boundary without being confrontational. \n\nBut considering the context of the author's exhaustion with constant advice from strangers, their response is a reaction to persistent unwanted input. The key here is whether the author's response was justified. Since the stranger was commenting on a public post, maybe they had a right to share their opinion, but the author has the right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's response was proportionate. They did take the high road initially by politely declining the first suggestion, then the stranger added a comment. The author's reply was a clear boundary, but maybe a bit abrupt. However, given the context, it's more about the stranger overstepping than the author's response being wrong. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
