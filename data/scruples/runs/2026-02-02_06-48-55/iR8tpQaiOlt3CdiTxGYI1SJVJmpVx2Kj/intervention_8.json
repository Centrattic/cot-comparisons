I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about wedding planning and interacting with a stranger's comment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have already booked most of their wedding vendors. The author's mom is paying for everything except the rehearsal dinner. They were looking into a videographer suggested by a family friend, but it's too expensive. The family friend posted it on Facebook, and then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments, saying quality is important because photos and videos last forever. The author responds by stating the videographer is out of budget and that it's their day, and they don't need input from strangers.\n\nThe author feels frustrated about strangers giving unsolicited advice. The question is whether the author was wrong for responding that way.\n\nNow, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's point is that they don't want strangers dictating how to plan their wedding. The stranger's comment seems to be trying to persuade them to choose the more expensive option, implying that quality is crucial. The author's response is direct and dismissive.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the stranger was commenting on a public post, so maybe that's why they felt it was appropriate to chime in. However, the author has the right to set boundaries about who can give advice. The author's response was firm but polite, stating the budget and that it's their day. The key here is whether the response was appropriate. The author didn't engage in an argument but clearly communicated their stance. The stranger's comment might have been intrusive, so the author's defense is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have responded differently? Maybe, but they were within their right to decline the input. The author's frustration is valid, as unsolicited advice from strangers can be overwhelming. The response was direct but not hostile. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they are defending their autonomy in making decisions for their wedding, which is a personal matter.\n"
