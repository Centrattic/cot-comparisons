I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author was looking for a videographer as per their mom's request, but a family friend suggested someone expensive. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality, implying maybe they should go with her son despite the cost.\n\nFirst, the author had already decided the suggested videographer was too expensive. They politely declined the family friend's suggestion. Then the stranger adds a comment that the author found pushy. The author responds by stating their budget constraints and asserting that it's their day, not wanting strangers to dictate how to run it. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is within their rights to set their own budget and make their own choices. The stranger was giving unsolicited advice, which can be annoying. The author's response is direct but not necessarily rude. They explained their stance and closed the conversation. \n\nIs there a wrong here? The stranger was being pushy, and the author was defending their autonomy. The author didn't engage further, just set a boundary. Usually, people are allowed to make their own decisions without unsolicited input. The tone of the author's response might be a bit strong, but given the context, it's understandable. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're standing up for their own choices against a stranger's intrusion.\n"
