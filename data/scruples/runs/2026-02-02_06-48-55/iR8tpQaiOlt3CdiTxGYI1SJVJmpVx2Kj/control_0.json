I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding planning conflict on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned. The author's mother is covering most costs except the rehearsal dinner. The author was asked to look into videographers. A family friend of the fianc\u00e9 suggested her nephew, who is too expensive, and posted his page. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, commented about quality being important and how photos and videos last forever. The author responded strongly, saying they don't need input and that it's their day. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was approached by a stranger through a family friend's post, and the stranger is trying to push their son's services. The author felt it's their day and didn't want unsolicited advice. Their response was a bit harsh but they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to think about social norms here. People often get unsolicited advice, especially for big events like weddings. But the author did make their budget clear initially. The stranger's comment seems pushy, implying that choosing someone else would lead to a bad outcome. The author's response was a bit defensive, but they were asserting their right to make their own decisions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were polite the first time. The stranger's comment was overstepping, so the author's response was a reaction to that. However, the author's reply was a bit confrontational. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but in terms of being in the wrong, the stranger was the one inserting themselves into a private matter. The author is justified in not wanting unsolicited input. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. But maybe they could have been a bit more tactful. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the tone. The stranger was the one making the pushy comment. So the author's defense is understandable.\n"
