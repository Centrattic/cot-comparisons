I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned, with the mom paying for everything except rehearsal dinner. They were looking at videographers, and a family friend suggested a nephew who's too expensive. The author politely said it's out of budget. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about quality being important, and the author responded defensively, saying they don't need strangers to tell them how to run their wedding.\n\nThe author is upset because they don't want strangers giving unsolicited advice. They felt the stranger was pushing her son's service and responding to that with a comment. The key points here are whether the author overreacted and if they were rude.\n\nThe author's response was a bit harsh. They said, \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\" They felt the stranger implied that choosing someone else would make their wedding \"shit.\" \n\nBut did the author have a right to be defensive? The stranger wasn't a close friend or family, so maybe it's reasonable to want to set boundaries. However, the tone of the author's response might be confrontational. The stranger's comment was about quality, which could be seen as well-meaning advice. But the author might feel overwhelmed by others' input, especially since they've already booked most vendors.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's frustration is understandable. They might be under pressure from family and strangers. However, responding with a dismissive comment could come off as rude. The question is whether the author was justified in their response. \n\nOn one hand, the stranger was a videographer's mom pushing her son's service, which could be seen as salesy. On the other, the author's response was abrupt. The line between standing up for one's choices and being rude is thin here. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014weddings are personal, and unsolicited advice can be stressful. But the way they expressed their disagreement might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. They had a right to set boundaries, but their response might have been too harsh. Depending on cultural norms and the tone, some might say they're not in the wrong because they're protecting their own preferences. Others might say they should have been more polite. \n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that the stranger was the one initiating unsolicited advice and the author was asserting their autonomy, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue the author's response was rude, making them at least partially in the wrong. However, the key is whether they were wrong to express their stance. Since they were defending their own decisions against a stranger's pushy input, maybe B is the better choice.\n"
