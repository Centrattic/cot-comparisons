I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding planning conflict on Facebook. The user and their fianc\u00e9 have already made most of their vendor decisions, and the mom is covering most of the costs. A family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The friend posted the videographer's page on the author's FB, and then a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about the importance of quality. The author responded defensively, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was already under pressure from family to look into a specific vendor, which they did, but it didn't fit their budget. The stranger's comment came off as unsolicited advice, which the author found intrusive. The author's response was a bit harsh, but they felt justified because they were tired of unsolicited input.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and respect. The videographer's mom was a stranger giving advice, which the author found unhelpful and intrusive. The author's response was to assert their autonomy, which is a common sentiment in weddings where couples don't want unsolicited advice. However, was the response appropriate?\n\nThe author's comment was direct and a bit confrontational, but they were standing up for their own preferences. The stranger's comment was also a bit pushy, implying that the videographer's service was necessary for a good wedding. The author's response might be seen as defensive, but they were protecting their personal space and decisions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered rude to give unsolicited advice, especially from a stranger. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way they responded could be seen as dismissive or arrogant. The line \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" might come off as rude, even if the sentiment is valid. \n\nBut considering that the videographer's mom was pushing her son's services and the author was already dealing with family pressure, the author's response is a way to set a boundary. It's a common situation where people feel defensive when their personal decisions are questioned by outsiders. \n\nSo, the author's actions were about asserting their right to make their own choices without interference. While the tone was a bit harsh, the core issue is about respecting boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were standing up for their own autonomy in a personal matter."
