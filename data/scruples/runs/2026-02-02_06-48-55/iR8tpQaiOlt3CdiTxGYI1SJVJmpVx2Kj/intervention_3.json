I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author responding to a stranger's comment about a videographer. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have already secured most of the wedding vendors. The author's mom is covering the costs except for the rehearsal dinner. The author was asked to look into a videographer, but they and the fianc\u00e9 aren't really interested. A family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined. Then, a stranger (the videographer's mom) commented on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality and the lasting value of photos and videos.\n\nThe author responded by saying the videographer is out of budget, that the wedding is theirs, and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their day. The key points here are the author's tone and the context of the interaction. The stranger, the videographer's mom, is trying to justify her son's price by highlighting the importance of the video. The author's reply is firm, which some might see as rude, especially since they didn't ask for the input.\n\nNow, considering etiquette: when someone is trying to sell a service, especially in a public forum, and you decline, it's generally polite to keep the response respectful. The author's response does come off as dismissive and a bit confrontational. Phrases like \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" might be seen as aggressive, even if the author is justified in not wanting unsolicited advice.\n\nHowever, the author also has a right to set boundaries. They didn't ask for the input, and the stranger was offering unsolicited advice. The line between being polite and being firm can be thin. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're overwhelmed with opinions. But the way they phrased their response could be seen as harsh, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their response was proportionate. They were defending their decision, which is their right, but the manner might have been inappropriate. Some might argue they're justified in asserting their autonomy, while others might say they should have been more courteous. In many AITA scenarios, the key is balance between standing one's ground and maintaining respect. Here, the author might have overstepped by being confrontational with a stranger, hence leaning towards AITA. But there's a counterargument that they were simply setting a boundary. However, given the public forum and the nature of the comment, the response could be seen as unnecessarily harsh, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
