I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned. A family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely said they can't afford it. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about quality being important. The author responds strongly, saying they don't need strangers' advice and that it's their day. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if their response was justified. \n\nThe author's main point is about being tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. The stranger's comment was pushy, implying that without their videographer, the wedding would be \"shit.\" The author's reply is a bit confrontational but in the context of defending their own preferences. \n\nIn such situations, people often feel defensive when their personal choices are criticized. The stranger, being a parent of a vendor, might be trying to sell their child's services. The author's response is a firm boundary, which is common in social media. While the tone is strong, it's a reaction to perceived overstepping. \n\nConsidering social norms, it's reasonable to set boundaries with strangers. The author isn't being rude without cause; they're responding to unsolicited input. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the author's phrasing could be seen as harsh. But given the context, it's a justified reaction to protect their event's autonomy."
