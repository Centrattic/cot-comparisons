I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple has already booked most of their vendors, and the mom is paying. The family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the post about the quality being important. The author responds by saying they don't need strangers' input and that it's their day.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The stranger isn't part of their close circle, so unsolicited advice can be annoying. The author's response was firm but not aggressive. They clarified their budget and that they want control over their wedding. \n\nThe stranger's comment was about the importance of quality for memories, which is a common sentiment. However, the author feels that this is pushing for a specific service. The response was direct but didn't attack the person. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often get defensive when strangers offer advice on personal matters like weddings. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they've been dealing with a lot of input. The response wasn't hostile, just clear and assertive. \n\nOn the other hand, the stranger might have thought she was helping by emphasizing the value of the service. But since the author had already stated the budget issue, the continued input was unnecessary. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction seems justified. They were setting boundaries for their personal event. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
