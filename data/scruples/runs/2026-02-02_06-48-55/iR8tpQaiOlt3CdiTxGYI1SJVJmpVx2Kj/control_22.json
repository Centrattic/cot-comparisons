I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who got annoyed when a stranger commented on their Facebook post about a videographer, trying to push their son's services.\n\nFirst, the author had already made most of the major decisions and only looked into the videographer because the mom asked. The family friend suggested the nephew, but he's too expensive. The author politely said he's out of budget. Then a stranger, the videographer's mom, comments with some advice about quality. The author responds defensively, saying they don't need input from strangers and that it's their day.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is within their rights to make their own decisions. They didn't ask for advice, and the stranger was trying to push a product. The author's response, while maybe a bit harsh, is a reaction to unsolicited advice. People often get upset when strangers overstep, especially on personal matters like weddings. The author's frustration is understandable, as they're the ones who will have to deal with the wedding. They didn't attack the person personally, just stood their ground. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
