I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author responded politely, then the stranger (the videographer's mom) commented about quality being the most important. The author then replied that the budget is an issue and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was appropriate. The key points here are that the stranger is a complete stranger, not a family member or close friend. People often get unsolicited advice from strangers, especially when planning big events like weddings. The author is tired of such input. Their response was firm but not aggressive, stating their budget constraints and that it's their day to make their own decisions. The stranger's comment came off as pushy, implying that using a cheaper option would mean a worse wedding. The author's reply asserts their autonomy and sets a boundary. \n\nIn this context, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to make decisions for their wedding without interference from strangers. The stranger overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a public forum. The author's response was direct but respectful, explaining their reasoning. There's no indication that the author was rude or dismissive without cause. The main issue was the stranger's intrusion, so the author's pushback is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
