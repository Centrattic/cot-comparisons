I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the person is asking if they did the right thing by telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation involves a family friend suggesting a videographer through her son, who's too expensive. The stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality. The author responds by saying the budget is set and that they don't want a stranger telling them how to run their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is stressed about their wedding, which is understandable. They've already made most of the major decisions, and the videographer is being suggested by a family friend. The stranger's comment seems to be an unsolicited opinion, which might be frustrating. The author's response was a bit harsh, but they felt entitled to set boundaries.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the stranger did comment on a public post, which the author had shared. The author had the right to respond to protect their own decisions. However, the tone of the response might be seen as dismissive. The stranger's comment was about the importance of quality, which the author interpreted as a pushy suggestion. The author's reply was direct but maybe a bit defensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the stranger shouldn't have assumed the role of advising on a decision that's not hers to make. The author's main point was that they want control over their wedding and don't want unsolicited advice. Their response, while a bit strong, is justifiable because they were defending their autonomy. \n\nSo considering all factors, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing up for their decision and setting boundaries with someone who wasn't part of their inner circle. The stranger overstepped by commenting on a personal decision, and the author had the right to respond as they did.\n"
