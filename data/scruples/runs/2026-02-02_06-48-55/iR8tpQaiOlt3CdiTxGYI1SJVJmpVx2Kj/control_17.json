I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The author's fianc\u00e9 and they have already booked most of the venues and vendors, and the author's mom is paying for most of it. They were looking into a videographer suggested by a family friend, but it's too pricey. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments about the importance of quality, implying that the videographer's service is essential.\n\nThe author responds by saying the stranger shouldn't tell them how to run their wedding. They're frustrated with strangers giving unsolicited advice. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for this reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings can be a sensitive topic, especially when family and finances are involved. The author's mom is paying for the wedding, so maybe there's some pressure there. The author's main point is about the budget and autonomy over their wedding. The stranger's comment might have come off as pushy or dismissive of the couple's priorities.\n\nThe author's response was firm, but they were polite. They clarified that the videographer is out of budget and that strangers shouldn't dictate how they plan their event. The key here is whether the author overstepped. The stranger's initial comment was unsolicited and possibly aggressive, so the author's pushback is understandable. They're standing up for their own preferences and budget. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being tired of strangers giving input. The response was a direct reply to the stranger's comment, which was intrusive. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their autonomy. The stranger had no right to comment in that way, so the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
