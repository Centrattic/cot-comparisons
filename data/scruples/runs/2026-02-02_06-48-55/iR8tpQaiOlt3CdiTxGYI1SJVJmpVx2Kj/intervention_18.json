I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a wedding planning discussion on Facebook where the author responds to a stranger's comment about a videographer's cost.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer, but he's too expensive. The friend posted his page, and then the videographer's mom, a stranger, commented about the importance of quality. The author then responds that the videographer is out of budget and states that it's their day, not the stranger's input.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was appropriate. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication style. The author mentions being tired of strangers commenting on their wedding, which is understandable. They were polite in the initial response to the family friend, explaining it's out of budget. However, when the stranger (the videographer's mom) added a comment, the author's reply was more confrontational. \n\nThe author's comment says, \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding.\" That's a strong statement. While the user might feel that the stranger overstepped, the tone of the response could be seen as dismissive or rude. However, the author was defending their autonomy in making decisions about their wedding. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had the right to make their own choices about the wedding. They were polite initially but then more direct with the stranger. The stranger's comment might have been intended as advice, but since it's a stranger, the author isn't obligated to consider it. The author's response was firm but not necessarily wrong. They were standing up for their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have responded more politely, but given the frustration expressed, their reaction is understandable. The question is whether they were in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were asserting their control over their wedding day and responding to unsolicited advice, even if the tone was a bit harsh. People often give unsolicited advice, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries.\n"
