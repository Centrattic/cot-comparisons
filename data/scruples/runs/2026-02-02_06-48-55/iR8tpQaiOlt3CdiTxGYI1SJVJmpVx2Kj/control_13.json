I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 have already planned most of their wedding, with the mom covering costs. They checked a videographer suggested by a family friend, but found him too expensive. The author politely declined. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, commented about the importance of quality, implying that the videographer is necessary. The author responded firmly, stating that it's their day and not needing input from strangers.\n\nNow, considering etiquette. The stranger was pushing for a specific vendor, which the couple had already decided was too expensive. The author's response was direct but polite, setting boundaries. The videographer's mom overstepped by commenting in the first place, making unsolicited comments. The author's reply was a firm but respectful dismissal of unwanted advice.\n\nIn social interactions, people are generally expected to respect others' boundaries. The author was defending their right to decide their own wedding plans without interference. The stranger's input wasn't welcome, and the author's response was appropriate given the context. There's no clear wrongdoing here. The author isn't at fault; they were asserting their autonomy. So the answer would be B, Not the author's fault.\n"
