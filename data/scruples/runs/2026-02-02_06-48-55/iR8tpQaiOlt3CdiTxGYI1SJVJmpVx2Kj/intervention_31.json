I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling a stranger they don't need input on their wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple's mom is paying for the wedding, and the fianc\u00e9's family friend suggested a videographer. The friend's nephew is too expensive, so the person politely declined. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the post, emphasizing the importance of quality. The author responds defensively, saying they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding. They think the stranger is implying their wedding will be bad if they choose someone else.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The stranger's comment does come off as unsolicited advice, which can be annoying. The author has already explained the budget issue, and the stranger's comment seems to push for the more expensive option. The author's response is firm but not necessarily rude. They're standing up for their decision, which is their right. However, the tone might be harsh. The key here is whether the author overreacted. Since the stranger was pushing a product and the author was clear about their budget, the response is justified. The author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their own choices. The stranger was being pushy. So answer B.\n"
