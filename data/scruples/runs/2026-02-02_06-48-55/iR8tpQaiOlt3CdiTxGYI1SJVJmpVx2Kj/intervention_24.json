I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding planning conflict. The author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning their wedding, and they're getting input from a family friend and a stranger, the videographer's mom.\n\nFirst, the family friend suggested her nephew as a videographer, but he's too expensive. The author politely declined because of the budget. Then a stranger (the videographer's mom) comments on the Facebook post, pushing for the importance of quality, implying maybe they should still hire the expensive videographer. The author responds by saying the budget is the main concern and that they want to run their own wedding, not take advice from strangers.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're tired of strangers giving unsolicited advice. They felt that the stranger's comment was intrusive and not helpful, so they stood up for their decision. They want to know if they were wrong for responding that way.\n\nNow, considering the context: the videographer's mom is a stranger inserting herself into the conversation, probably to promote her son's service. The author's response was direct and firm, but not necessarily rude. They thanked her after stating their position. The key points here are unsolicited advice and the boundary of strangers commenting on personal decisions.\n\nOn one hand, the videographer's mom overstepped by giving advice to strangers. On the other hand, the author's response was defending their autonomy. The question is, was the author in the wrong for asserting their boundaries? The author's response was polite but clear, which is a reasonable way to handle such a situation. They didn't attack the person but stated their position. \n\nThe alternative is that the author could have been more patient and explained their budget constraints again, but the issue is that the advice was unsolicited. The author isn't obligated to entertain every suggestion, especially from strangers. So in this case, the author's response seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong.\n"
