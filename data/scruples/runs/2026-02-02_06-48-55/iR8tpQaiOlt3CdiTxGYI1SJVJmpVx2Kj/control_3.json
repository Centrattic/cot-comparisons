I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have most of their wedding planned. The mom is covering most of the costs, and they're just looking into the videographer. A family friend suggested her nephew, who is too expensive. The author politely turned that down. Then a stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments on the Facebook post, emphasizing the importance of quality and how things like photos last forever. The author responds by stating the budget issue and that they don't want strangers telling them how to plan their wedding.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author was approached by a stranger (the videographer's mom) after they had already rejected the suggestion. The stranger's comment came off as pushy, implying that their choice would affect the quality of their wedding. The author's response is defensive and a bit harsh, but they're frustrated with unsolicited advice.\n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone is planning a big event like a wedding, it's common for people to offer opinions, especially if they're in the industry. But in this case, the author had already dismissed the initial suggestion, so the stranger's comment might have felt like overstepping. The author's response was firm but not necessarily rude\u2014it was a clear boundary setting. They made it clear that the budget is a factor and that they don't want unsolicited advice from strangers.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their response was appropriate given the context. Since they had already been polite in declining the initial suggestion and the stranger continued to push the product, the author's response was a valid assertion of their autonomy. They have the right to make decisions for their wedding without pressure from strangers. The comment from the videographer's mom seemed manipulative, using emotional appeal to push her son's services, which the author rightly called out.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They set a boundary after receiving unsolicited and pushy advice from a stranger. Their response was justified given the context of prior rejection and the intrusive comment.\n"
