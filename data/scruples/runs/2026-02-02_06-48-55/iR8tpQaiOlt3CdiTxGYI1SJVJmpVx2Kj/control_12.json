I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. Let me read the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is engaged and doesn't like Facebook but used it to look for vendors. Their mom is paying for the wedding except the rehearsal dinner. The mom asked them to look into videographers, so they did. A family friend suggested her nephew, but he's too expensive. The user politely said he's out of budget. Then a random stranger, who turns out to be the videographer's mom, comments about quality being important. The user responds by saying the budget is a problem, that it's their day, and that they don't want strangers telling them how to run their wedding. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the stranger commented on a Facebook post, which the user had already responded to the family friend. The stranger's comment seems to be defending the videographer's value, implying that the user's budget choice might compromise the quality. The user then confronts the stranger, stating budget constraints and not wanting unsolicited advice.\n\nNow, considering social norms: when people give advice, even if unsolicited, it's usually meant to help. But in this case, the user had already made a decision based on budget. The stranger's comment might come off as pushy, trying to upsell the videographer. The user's response was a bit harsh but justifiable because they were firm about their budget and wanted to end the conversation.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? The stranger was a stranger pushing their service, and the user had the right to set boundaries. The user's response was direct but not aggressive. They explained their reasoning. The key points are the stranger's intrusion and the user asserting their autonomy. So the user isn't wrong here. Answer B.\n"
