I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a stranger not to give input on their wedding. The situation is that a family friend suggested a videographer, but he was too expensive. The author's mother was involved in looking into it, so they mentioned the budget issue. Then a complete stranger (the videographer's mom) commented pushing the idea of quality being most important, and the author responded harshly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and fianc\u00e9 are making the wedding plans, so it's their day and their decision. The stranger's comment was unsolicited and a bit pushy, implying that not getting the most expensive videographer would be a mistake. The author's response was defensive, maybe a bit rude. But was the author wrong to do so?\n\nWell, the author's main point is that they don't want strangers giving unsolicited advice. The stranger was trying to upsell the videographer, possibly in a manipulative way. The author's reply was direct and firm, but maybe a bit confrontational. However, given that it's a personal event and the author is within their rights to decline advice from someone not close to them, it's possible they were justified. The line \"I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding\" shows they're standing their ground, which is reasonable when it's their day. \n\nOn the other hand, the response was a bit harsh. The author could have been more polite, like thanking the stranger but reiterating the budget constraints. But the stranger's comment might have been interpreted as intrusive, especially since the author was already handling the decision. The author's mother was the one who wanted a videographer, so the stranger's comment might have been seen as overstepping by implying that the author's choice was wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA, it's usually about whether the person overreacted or was unreasonable. The author was clear and firm but didn't outright attack or make a scene. They were defending their autonomy. The stranger was being pushy and perhaps manipulative, so the author's response, while terse, might be understandable. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to make decisions for their wedding, and the stranger was being uninvited and pushy. The author's response was a boundary setting, which is okay, even if not the most polite.\n"
