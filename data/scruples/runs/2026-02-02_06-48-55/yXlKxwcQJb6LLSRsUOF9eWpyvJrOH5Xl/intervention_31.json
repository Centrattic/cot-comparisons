We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their finances and whether they're considering the wife's acne medication as a necessity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author is saying that the wife's acne medication isn't a necessity and that she should use her non-essential budget for it. On the other hand, the wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential, her acne medication should be too. She also mentions that she would be in pain without it, which implies that it's medically necessary for her.\n\nNow, birth control is typically seen as essential for family planning, which aligns with the author's reasoning. But acne medication can vary. For some people, especially if it's prescribed for severe acne, it might be essential for their mental health and self-esteem. If the wife's dermatologist has deemed it necessary and it's part of her treatment plan, then maybe it's not just a non-essential. The mention of pain is a bit confusing because acne isn't usually painful, but maybe she's referring to emotional distress or physical discomfort from untreated acne.\n\nThe author is categorizing it as non-essential, but if the medication is prescribed and necessary for her well-being, not including it in essential expenses might be unfair. The wife's argument that it's important for her and should be covered similarly to birth control makes sense. It seems like the author is not considering the medical necessity aspect and treating it as a discretionary expense, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the importance of the medication for the wife's health.\n"
