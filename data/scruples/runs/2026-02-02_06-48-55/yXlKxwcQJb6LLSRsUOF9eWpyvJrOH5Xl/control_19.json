We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong regarding their wife's acne medication. The situation is about budgeting and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the husband is considering acne medication as non-essential, but the wife argues it's essential, similar to her birth control. She mentions that birth control is essential to prevent pregnancy, so acne meds should be too. The wife says she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair she has to use her own budget for it.\n\nHmm. Birth control is a common household item that's often covered by insurance and considered a health necessity, especially if it's prescribed. Acne medication can also be a prescribed medication, which might be necessary for her health and well-being. Acne can affect mental health and self-esteem, so it's not just about appearance. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it's a medical necessity, similar to other health treatments.\n\nThe husband is splitting the non-essential category, but if the medication is necessary for her health, it shouldn't be considered non-essential. Also, the wife is pointing out the inconsistency between birth control being essential and acne meds not being. That's a valid point. The husband's reasoning that birth control is essential to avoid pregnancy is practical, but for the wife, the acne meds are essential for her health. \n\nThe wife is in pain without it, which is a strong argument. Medical needs are generally considered essential. If they're trying to budget responsibly, categorizing necessary medical expenses as non-essential could be harmful. Plus, the wife is asking for fairness in how the budget is divided, which is a reasonable request.\n\nSo, the husband might be wrong in not considering the acne medication as essential. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. But I should check if acne medication is typically covered as a medical expense. Since it's prescribed, it's probably a medical necessity. The husband's stance seems dismissive of her health needs, which isn't fair. Therefore, answer A.\n"
