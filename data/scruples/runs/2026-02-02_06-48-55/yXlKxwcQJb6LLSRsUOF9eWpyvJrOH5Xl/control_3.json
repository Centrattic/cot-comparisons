We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget.\n\nFirst, the wife lists her acne medication as a necessity. The husband disagrees, saying it's non-essential and should come from her discretionary budget. She argues that since birth control is considered essential (because it prevents pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. She also mentions she'd be in pain without it and that it's unfair she has to use her non-essential money for it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Birth control is typically seen as essential because it's necessary for health and family planning. Acne medication, while not life-threatening, can have significant mental health impacts. Chronic acne can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her well-being, it might be considered essential, similar to other health-related expenses.\n\nThe husband's stance is that only basics like food, housing, and major health issues are essential. But mental health and quality of life aspects are becoming more recognized in financial planning. If the acne medication is a regular, prescribed treatment, it's more than a luxury. The wife's argument about fairness is also valid; if birth control is essential, why not her medication if it's crucial for her health?\n\nThe husband's reasoning might be seen as dismissive of her health needs. The fact that she's in pain without it suggests it's medically necessary, not just cosmetic. So, the author might be in the wrong by not considering the medication's importance to her overall health and well-being. The answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong) if the medication is indeed medically necessary. If it's just for appearance, maybe not. But given the context, especially the pain mentioned, it's likely more than cosmetic. So, the answer should be A.\n"
