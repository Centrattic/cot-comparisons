We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential. They're trying to manage finances and categorizing expenses. \n\nFirst, the author lists acne medication as non-essential, while the wife argues it's essential like her birth control. The wife points out that birth control is essential to avoid pregnancy, so acne meds should be too. The author counters that birth control is essential for preventing kids. The wife then says she'll be in pain without the meds and feels unfair to use her personal budget for it.\n\nHmm. Acne medication can be a sensitive issue. It's not life-threatening like some medications, but for some people, it's crucial for their mental health and self-esteem. Especially if it's prescribed and needed regularly. The wife's argument is that it's important for her well-being, similar to birth control. The author might not see it that way, maybe viewing it as a cosmetic issue. But that's a big assumption.\n\nThe key here is whether the medication is genuinely necessary. If the doctor prescribed it and it's part of her treatment plan, then it's a medical necessity. If it's over-the-counter, maybe the author sees it differently, but if it's a regular expense, categorizing it as non-essential when it's affecting her health might be incorrect. Also, the wife's point about using her personal budget feels unfair\u2014maybe she's expected to cover it from a part of her budget that's for non-essentials, which seems like an unfair burden if it's actually essential for her.\n\nThe author's reasoning might stem from seeing birth control as essential for practical reasons (avoiding pregnancy) but not seeing acne treatment in the same light. However, if the acne medication is vital for her mental health, then it's a necessary expense. The author dismissing it as non-essential without understanding its importance to the wife could be the issue here. The wife's pain and the emotional impact are real, even if the author doesn't perceive it that way.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the importance of the acne medication to the wife's well-being, similar to how birth control is essential for both preventing pregnancy and managing her reproductive health. The fair approach would be to consider both medications as essential if they're prescribed and necessary for the wife's health. The author's refusal to adjust the budget accordingly, especially when the wife is experiencing pain, suggests a lack of empathy or understanding. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
