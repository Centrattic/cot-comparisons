We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not considering his wife's acne medication as a necessity. The situation is about budgeting and deciding what counts as essential. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments from both sides. The author thinks acne meds aren't essential, so his wife should use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since birth control is essential, her acne meds should be too. The author counters that birth control is essential because it prevents unwanted pregnancy. The wife then says she'll be in pain without the meds and that it's unfair for her to pay for it from her non-essential funds.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about what's considered essential. Birth control is typically seen as a medical necessity, even if it's for contraception, because it's a preventive healthcare measure. Acne medication could be seen similarly if it's prescribed and necessary for her health. The author is treating them differently, but maybe there's a nuance here. \n\nThe wife mentions pain, which might relate to the severity of her acne. If her acne is causing physical pain or significant psychological distress, then the medication could be considered essential for her well-being. The author's comparison to birth control is interesting because birth control is often classified as a medical necessity, so if acne medication is similarly crucial for her health, then his stance might be unfair.\n\nAlso, the fairness aspect comes into play. The wife is saying she has to use her non-essential budget for something she deems essential, which might not be equitable. Financial planning should consider both partners' health needs. The author's approach seems rigid, not accounting for the personal impact on his wife. \n\nBut maybe there's a difference in intent. Birth control is a preventive measure for a specific medical need (contraception), while acne medication is for a skin condition. However, if the acne is a medical issue requiring prescription meds, then it's part of her healthcare. It's possible the author isn't seeing it that way, which could be where he's wrong. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal views on what's essential. Some might argue that managing chronic conditions, even if they're not life-threatening, is essential for quality of life. Acne can affect self-esteem and mental health, so the medication might be necessary in that context. \n\nIn terms of fairness in shared finances, both partners should have their health needs considered as essential. The author's refusal to categorize the acne meds as essential might be dismissive of his wife's health concerns. The wife's argument about using her non-essential budget is about fairness, implying that she shouldn't have to bear the cost if it's essential for her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that the acne medication is a necessary part of his wife's healthcare, similar to birth control. His categorization as non-essential could be seen as neglecting her health needs, which are important for her overall well-being. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
