We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not considering their wife's acne medication as a necessity. The couple is budgeting and categorizing expenses. The wife wants her acne medication labeled as essential, similar to her birth control. The husband argues that birth control is essential because it prevents pregnancy, while acne medication isn't. The wife counters that the medication is important for her well-being and causes pain if not used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions of \"essential\" in a financial context. Typically, essential expenses are those required for basic living needs like housing, food, healthcare. Birth control is often considered essential as it's a healthcare expense for reproductive health. Acne medication can also be a healthcare expense, especially if it's prescribed and necessary for the person's health. The wife mentions that she would be in pain without it, which implies it's medically necessary for her.\n\nThe husband's argument that birth control is essential to avoid an unplanned pregnancy is valid, but that doesn't necessarily mean other medications aren't essential. The key here is whether the acne medication is a necessary medical expense. If it's prescribed by a doctor and required for her health, it's reasonable to categorize it as essential. The wife's argument that she should not have to use her discretionary budget for it makes sense because necessary medical expenses are typically considered non-discretionary.\n\nThe husband's stance might stem from a misunderstanding of what constitutes an essential expense. By not acknowledging the acne medication as essential, he's placing a financial burden on his wife to cover it from her non-essential budget, which could be unfair if the medication is indeed necessary for her health. The wife's point about fairness and shared responsibility in finances is valid here. It's about recognizing that healthcare needs, including mental and physical health, are essential regardless of the condition being treated.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal to categorize the acne medication as essential without understanding its necessity for the wife's health might be considered wrong. Essential expenses should include necessary medical treatments, and the husband's comparison to birth control doesn't invalidate the importance of the acne medication. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
