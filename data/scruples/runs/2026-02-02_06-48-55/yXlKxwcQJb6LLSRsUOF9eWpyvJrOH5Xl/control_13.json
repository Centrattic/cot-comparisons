We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about finances and whether acne medication should be considered a necessary expense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband thinks acne medication is non-essential and wants the wife to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential, her acne medication should be too. She also mentions she'll be in pain without it.\n\nI should consider the reasoning. Birth control is often seen as essential because it's a contraceptive and has health benefits, but acne medication's necessity might be subjective. However, if the medication is prescribed and necessary for her health or well-being, it could be considered essential. The wife's point about pain is a bit confusing\u2014acne isn't typically painful, unless it's severe. Maybe she means emotional distress or self-esteem issues? That's a valid concern.\n\nFinancial responsibility is key here. The couple is trying to budget. The husband is categorizing expenses, but the wife's medication might be a medical necessity. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, it's more of an essential expense. The husband's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs, especially if the medication is part of her regular healthcare.\n\nAlso, the wife's argument about using her own budget isn't unreasonable. If they have separate budgets for non-essentials, but she's being forced to use that for something she deems essential, that could be unfair. Maybe the husband isn't considering the emotional or health impact of not having the medication.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that both should contribute and find a middle ground. But the key is whether the medication is truly essential. If it's a regular medical need, then the husband's categorization is incorrect. The wife's birth control example is a good comparison because if that's essential, then a related health issue's treatment should be too.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the necessity of her acne medication, especially if it's part of her medical treatment. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
