I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessary expense. The husband counts it as non-essential, while the wife argues it's essential, similar to birth control. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is that non-essential expenses can be cut to manage overspending. The wife argues that her acne medication is essential because it's necessary for her health, like birth control. She mentions she'll be in pain without it, which might indicate that the medication is medically necessary.\n\nI should think about what defines an essential expense. Typically, essential items are things like housing, food, healthcare. Birth control is often considered essential because it's part of reproductive health. Acne medication could fall into a similar category if it's prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her well-being. If the medication is over-the-counter, maybe the husband sees it as a choice, but if it's a prescription and part of a medical treatment plan, it's more like an essential health expense.\n\nThe wife's argument that she's in pain without it suggests that it's not just about appearance but actual health. Chronic acne can lead to scarring and has psychological effects, so it's a valid medical need. The husband might not realize the severity of her condition. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to manage finances and cut non-essentials. If they're overspending, he might be looking to trim any expenses that aren't strictly necessary. But if the medication is a regular, necessary part of her health, cutting it could have negative consequences. \n\nThe key here is whether the acne medication is a necessary medical expense. If it's part of ongoing treatment that the doctor deems essential, then it should be considered necessary. The fact that the wife compares it to birth control, which is essential, supports her argument. The husband's reasoning that birth control is essential because it prevents pregnancy is valid, but the wife's point is that her acne medication is equally essential for her health.\n\nSo, the husband might be in the wrong if he's dismissing a legitimate medical expense. He's not considering the wife's health needs and is treating it as something discretionary. The wife's argument about using her monthly budget for something essential seems valid. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being the husband.\n"
