We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as a non-necessity in their budget. They're trying to manage finances after overspending.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thinks acne medication isn't essential, so he's telling her to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since birth control is considered essential (to avoid an unplanned pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. She mentions she'll be in pain without it and wants to split the cost.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break down the factors. Essential vs. non-essential expenses can be subjective. Birth control is often seen as essential for health and preventing unintended pregnancies, which is a major financial concern. Acne medication might be considered non-essential by some, but for others, especially if it's prescribed by a doctor, it's part of their health management. The wife's argument is that both are health-related, so if one is essential, the other should be too. The author is differentiating between them, which could be seen as dismissive of her health needs.\n\nAlso, the wife's mention of pain is important. If the acne is causing her physical or emotional distress, that's a valid health concern. The author's response might not be acknowledging that. The fairness aspect is another point\u2014she's saying she shouldn't have to use her monthly budget for something she deems essential, implying that splitting the cost is fair. The author is not willing to share the cost, which could be seen as not supporting her health needs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of partnership in finances. When couples budget together, it's about mutual agreement and support. The author is making a judgment on what's essential without considering his wife's perspective, which might lead to conflict. The wife feels her needs are being undervalued compared to other essentials like birth control.\n\nIn terms of societal or medical standards, sometimes medications for chronic conditions or prescribed treatments are considered essential. If the acne medication is a prescription and part of her treatment plan, it's more about health, not just appearance. The author's classification as non-essential might not align with that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not considering the wife's health perspective, is drawing a line between two health-related expenses without a clear justification, and isn't offering support in sharing the cost. This could be seen as being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
