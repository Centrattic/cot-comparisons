We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not considering his wife's acne medication as a necessity. \n\nFirst, the context is that they're trying to manage their finances. The wife wants her acne medication included in their necessary expenses. The husband argues it's non-essential, while the wife compares it to her birth control, which he considers essential. The wife says she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair for her to pay from her non-essential budget.\n\nI need to evaluate if the husband is wrong here. Acne can have a significant impact on mental health and self-esteem. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it's a medical necessity. Birth control is considered essential for preventing pregnancy, so by that logic, acne medication, which treats a medical condition, should also be essential. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is necessary to avoid having a child, but he's dismissing the wife's medical needs. That seems inconsistent. Also, the wife's argument about fairness is valid; she shouldn't have to cover essential medical costs from her discretionary budget. Financial planning should account for necessary healthcare. The husband's stance might be neglecting her health needs, which are legitimate. So, the answer would be that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
