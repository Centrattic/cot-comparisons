We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about financial planning between a husband and wife.\n\nSo the wife says her acne medication is a necessary expense, while the husband classifies it as non-essential. The wife argues that since birth control is considered essential (to prevent pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. The husband counters that birth control is essential for them to avoid having a child, implying it's a necessity for their family planning. The wife then says she'll be in pain without the medication and that it's unfair to make her pay from her non-essential budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity angle. Acne medication can be more than just cosmetic; it can affect mental health and self-esteem. If it's prescribed by a doctor, it's likely considered a necessary medical expense. On the other hand, birth control is often classified as essential, especially if it's for health reasons or family planning. The husband's reasoning might be that since birth control is essential for their family's financial planning (to avoid unexpected pregnancy), he's extending that logic to include other medications. However, he's differentiating between the two by their necessity, which might not hold up if the acne medication is truly necessary for the wife's health.\n\nThe wife's point about using her non-essential budget seems to be a point of contention. If the medication is essential, it's unfair to expect her to cover it with her discretionary funds. The husband's classification could be seen as dismissive of her health needs, especially if the medication is a regular and necessary part of her health regimen. There's also the aspect of fairness in shared financial responsibility. If they're splitting budgets, expecting one spouse to cover a necessary expense from their non-essential portion might be unfair, especially if it's a medical need.\n\nI should also think about cultural or societal norms. In many contexts, mental and physical health is considered essential, so acne medication that's required for a medical condition would fall into that category. However, if the medication is for mild acne and not prescribed, maybe it's different. The scenario doesn't specify that, though. The wife mentions pain, which could indicate that the acne is severe enough to cause physical discomfort, making it a medical necessity.\n\nThe husband's argument that birth control is essential because it prevents a child is valid from a family planning standpoint, but he's not applying the same logic to the acne medication. That might be where he's in the wrong\u2014treating two medical necessities differently without a clear justification. If both are necessary, they should both be considered essential. The fact that the wife is in pain without the medication adds weight to her side, suggesting that it's not just about aesthetics but her well-being.\n\nAlso, the way the husband is handling the budget by categorizing things as essential or non-essential is part of the issue. Financial planning should take into account each partner's health needs. If the medication is necessary, not covering it in the essential budget could be seen as neglecting her health for financial reasons, which isn't ideal.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not recognizing the acne medication as a necessary expense, especially when the wife is experiencing pain and it's part of her health. The comparison to birth control being essential doesn't hold if both are medical necessities for different reasons. The husband's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs, making him the asshole in this situation.\n"
