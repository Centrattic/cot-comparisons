We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not considering their wife's acne medication as a necessity. The context is about budgeting and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the wife's medication is for acne. Acne can have psychological effects, affecting self-esteem and mental health. The author argues it's non-essential, comparing it to non-essential expenses. The wife counters by comparing it to birth control, which is considered essential because it's for preventing pregnancy. The author's reasoning is that birth control is essential for avoiding an unwanted child, while acne meds aren't as crucial. But the wife argues that without the meds, she'll be in pain, implying it's medically necessary for her.\n\nI need to consider if acne medication is classified as a necessary medical expense. Health issues that affect quality of life or have medical necessity might be seen as essential. The wife's argument is that the medication is important for her well-being, similar to birth control. The author's stance seems dismissive of her health needs, treating her medication as a luxury. This might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since medical treatments for chronic conditions (even if not life-threatening) are generally considered necessary. The author not allowing her to use her own budget for this could be seen as unfair, especially if she's in pain. So, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the medication's importance to her health and well-being. The answer would be A.\n"
