We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author and his wife are budgeting and trying to decide what's a necessary expense. The wife wants to include her acne medication as a necessity, but the author argues it's not essential and she should use her non-essential budget. The wife counters by comparing it to birth control, which they consider essential. The author says birth control is essential for not having kids, but the wife says she'll be in pain without the medication and it's unfair she has to use her own budget for it.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether acne medication is considered a necessary medical expense. Acne can have a significant impact on mental health and self-esteem. If the medication is prescribed and necessary for her well-being, it should be considered a medical expense. Birth control is also medical, so the comparison makes sense. The author distinguishes between the two, but maybe that's not fair. Pain from acne isn't physical like a broken bone, but the psychological impact is real. \n\nThe wife is arguing that she shouldn't have to use her discretionary funds for something that's important for her health. The author is trying to manage finances, but maybe not considering the emotional and health aspects. Financial planning should include medical needs. If the medication is part of maintaining her health, it's a necessity. The author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the importance of her mental health and not supporting her medical needs as essential. Also, fairness in splitting expenses is a part of a relationship, so using her personal budget for something she's responsible for might be unfair.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong (A) because he's not acknowledging his wife's medical needs and the emotional impact of not providing necessary medication. The wife's perspective is valid, and the author should consider that her acne medication is as essential as her birth control for her well-being.\n"
