We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong when it comes to categorizing their wife's acne medication as non-essential in their finances. The situation is that they're trying to cut down on spending and have listed necessary expenses. The wife wants the acne medication as essential, but the author doesn't agree, unlike her birth control, which he does consider essential.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. Acne medication versus birth control. The author's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid having a kid, which is a valid point. But the wife argues that without her acne medication, she would be in pain, so it's also essential. The author is suggesting she use her non-essential budget for it, while she wants it covered as a necessity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the usual advice on financial responsibilities in a relationship. Generally, shared expenses include things that are necessary for health and well-being. Birth control is often seen as essential because it's a medical need with broader implications (like preventing pregnancy, which affects both partners). Acne medication, on the other hand, is more of a cosmetic or dermatological treatment. However, acne can have significant psychological and emotional effects, especially if it's severe. The wife mentions \"pain,\" which might be emotional rather than physical, but it's still a valid concern.\n\nThe author is splitting the atom here by treating birth control as essential and acne medication as non-essential. But is that fair? It depends on how essential each party considers it. The wife clearly feels her acne medication is necessary, which could be due to medical advice or personal necessity. If a healthcare provider has deemed it necessary, then it's an essential expense. However, if it's for cosmetic reasons, maybe not. But in many relationships, supporting each other's health, even if it's not life-threatening, is considered important.\n\nThe author is making a judgment call about what's essential, which can be subjective. The wife's argument is that since birth control is essential, her acne medication should be too. The author's counter is that birth control has a different priority. The issue here is that the author is not engaging in a collaborative discussion but rather imposing their own view of what's essential. Financial planning in a relationship should involve mutual agreement, not unilateral decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, the wife is asking for fairness, pointing out that if he's covering her birth control, he should cover her acne medication as well. The author is making her use her non-essential budget, which might be part of a shared budget. If the budget is shared, then it's a joint responsibility. The author might be trying to save money, but the wife's health and self-esteem could be impacted if she can't access her medication.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're dismissing their wife's valid health concern as non-essential without considering her perspective. Even if the medication is for acne, which is sometimes seen as cosmetic, the emotional impact and medical necessity should be weighed. The author should have a conversation with the wife to understand why the medication is essential to her and find a compromise rather than unilaterally deciding it's non-essential. The answer is A.\n"
