We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe couple is budgeting and trying to cut non-essential expenses. The wife wants to include her acne medication as necessary, while the husband disagrees, categorizing it as non-essential. The wife compares it to her birth control, which the husband does consider essential because it prevents an unplanned pregnancy. She argues that without her acne medication, she'll be in pain and that it's important for her health. She also mentions that she should not have to use her non-essential budget for something so crucial.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that acne medication isn't essential like food or housing, whereas birth control is essential for family planning. But the wife is saying that her acne medication is essential for her well-being and health, similar to how birth control is essential for preventing pregnancy. The key point here is whether acne medication is considered a medical necessity. \n\nIn many cases, medications that treat chronic conditions or significantly impact a person's quality of life are considered essential. Acne can cause physical discomfort and psychological effects, so it's plausible that the medication is necessary for her. The husband might be underestimating the importance of her mental and physical health here. \n\nThe wife's argument that she shouldn't have to dip into a non-essential budget for something as important as her medication makes sense. If the birth control is essential, then the acne medication, which is prescribed for a medical condition, should also be considered essential. The husband's classification seems inconsistent. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not recognizing the necessity of the medication for his wife's health, similar to how he considers birth control essential. It's about empathy and understanding that medical needs vary and are essential even if they're not as immediately obvious as others.\n"
