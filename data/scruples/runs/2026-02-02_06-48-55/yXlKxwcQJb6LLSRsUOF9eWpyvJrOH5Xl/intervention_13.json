We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as a non-essential expense. They're trying to budget and cut costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife says her acne medication is essential, similar to birth control, which the husband already considers essential. The husband argues that birth control is essential to prevent having a child, but acne meds aren't. The wife counters that she's in pain without it and feels it should also be considered essential. \n\nSo, the key points here are: What's considered essential? The husband is categorizing expenses as necessary or not. The wife's argument is that her health (skin condition) is important, and she's in pain without the medication. \n\nNow, I need to consider if acne medication can be considered essential. Essential items are typically those necessary for basic health and well-being. Birth control is essential as it's a form of healthcare, preventing unintended pregnancy. Similarly, medical treatments for conditions that cause pain or significant health issues are also considered essential. Acne, while not life-threatening, can have significant psychological and emotional impacts. If the medication is prescribed and necessary for her health, maybe it's fair to include it as essential. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that birth control is essential because it prevents having a child is practical, but maybe he's not considering the other's perspective. The wife is stating that the acne medication is important for her, so she's in pain without it. Pain is a valid medical concern. \n\nI think the husband might be in the wrong here because he's not valuing his wife's health needs equally. If birth control is essential, then healthcare for her skin condition that causes pain should also be considered essential. Maybe he's prioritizing practical aspects over her well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's dismissing his wife's health needs by not considering the acne medication as essential, similar to how birth control is treated.\n"
