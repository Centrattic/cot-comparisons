We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They're budgeting and trying to distinguish between necessary and non-necessary expenses. The wife wants her acne medication classified as necessary, comparing it to her birth control, which the husband agrees is essential because it prevents pregnancy. The wife argues that without the acne medication, she'll be in pain, and she thinks it's unfair to make her use her monthly budget for it. The husband says it's non-essential and that she should use her allocated non-essential funds.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is acne medication considered a necessary medical expense? The wife's argument is that it's important for her health and well-being, similar to birth control. The husband's counter is that birth control is essential for avoiding pregnancy, but acne medication isn't. \n\nI should consider medical perspectives. Acne can have psychological effects and may be a medical condition requiring treatment. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it might be considered a necessary expense. However, some might argue that non-essential here refers to items that aren't critical for survival or preventing significant health issues. But if the acne is causing pain or emotional distress, then it's more than just cosmetic. \n\nAlso, fairness in splitting expenses. The wife is saying she shouldn't have to use her personal budget for something she deems essential. The husband is suggesting she use the non-essential part, which she finds unfair. This touches on how they define \"essential\" in their household and whether they should share costs for medical needs.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to birth control. If they agree to split the cost of birth control, why not acne medication? The husband's reasoning is that birth control prevents pregnancy, a tangible outcome. But the wife's point is that both are medical needs affecting her health. \n\nFinancial responsibility in marriage often involves compromise. What's fair? If the medication is a regular, necessary expense for her well-being, it's reasonable to consider it essential. The husband's stance might ignore the emotional and health impact on his wife. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Not all medications are essential. If there are alternatives or cost-saving measures, maybe that's a factor. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, many would see health-related expenses as necessary, especially if prescribed by a doctor. The wife's argument for fairness and shared responsibility might resonate more. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's dismissing a medical need that's affecting his wife's health and well-being, comparing it to birth control which they already agree is essential. The fairness aspect and the impact on her health suggest he's not considering her perspective adequately.\n"
