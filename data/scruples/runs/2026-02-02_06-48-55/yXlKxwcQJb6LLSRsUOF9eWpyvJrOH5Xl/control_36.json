I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault here. Let's see. The situation is about a couple budgeting and deciding what's a necessary expense. The husband is saying his wife's acne medication isn't essential, but he counts her birth control as essential. The wife disagrees, saying acne meds are important too, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered essential in a budget. Birth control is often seen as essential because it's preventive healthcare, especially if they're not planning to have a child. Acne medication can be tricky. While it's a medication, it's often considered more of a personal care item unless it's a prescribed treatment for a severe condition. But the wife mentions she'll be in pain without it. Wait, acne isn't typically associated with pain unless it's severe, like cystic acne. Maybe she's referring to the emotional or psychological impact, but the husband might not see it that way.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that since birth control is essential to avoid having a kid, acne meds aren't. The wife is arguing that both are important for her health. From a financial standpoint, essential vs. non-essential can be subjective. If the acne medication is a prescription and necessary for her well-being, maybe it's reasonable to consider it essential. However, the husband is categorizing it under non-essentials and telling her to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife is saying that's unfair because it's important for her.\n\nI should also think about the fairness of splitting responsibilities. If the husband is willing to cover birth control because it's essential, why not acne meds? Unless there's a medical reason that makes acne meds non-essential. But the wife is pointing out that her birth control is essential for them not to have a kid, implying that for her, the acne meds are essential for her own health. The husband's stance might be seen as dismissive of her health needs. \n\nThe key points here are whether acne medication is considered a necessary medical expense and if the husband is being fair in his categorization. If the wife's acne requires regular medication and it's a medical necessity, then it's reasonable to cover it as an essential. However, if it's something she can manage without, maybe the husband's view is valid. However, health needs are subjective, and the wife's perspective is that it's important for her. The husband might be underestimating the importance of her mental or physical health in this case.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her medical needs. Essential vs. non-essential can be a personal decision, but if the acne medication is part of her healthcare, it's reasonable to cover it. The wife's argument that it's important for her and should be shared responsibility is valid. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not seeing it as essential and making her use her non-essential budget for it.\n"
