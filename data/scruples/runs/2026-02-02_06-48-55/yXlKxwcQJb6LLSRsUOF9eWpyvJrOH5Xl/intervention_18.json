We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. They're trying to plan their finances and are categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the wife wants her acne medication listed as necessary. The husband argues it's non-essential, similar to how non-essentials are handled. The wife compares it to her birth control, which is essential because it's for preventing pregnancy. The husband counters that birth control is essential for avoiding an unintended child, implying that acne meds aren't as crucial.\n\nThe wife mentions she'll be in pain without the medication. That's a key point. If the acne medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then maybe it's more essential than he's considering. But some might argue that while it's important for her well-being, it's not as critical as basic needs like food, housing, or preventive healthcare. \n\nHowever, mental and physical health are often considered essential. If the medication is helping with a chronic condition and affecting her quality of life, maybe it should be categorized as necessary. The husband seems to be splitting hairs between what's essential versus non-essential, which can be subjective. The wife's perspective is that her health (both physical and mental) is essential, so she's trying to prioritize that. \n\nThe husband might be right in a strict budgeting sense if they're trying to cut non-essentials, but the wife's health needs might take precedence. The fact that she's in pain without it suggests it's more than a cosmetic issue. Also, comparing it to birth control, which is essential for preventing pregnancy, might make the acne medication seem similarly necessary for her health.\n\nI think the husband might be in the wrong because he's dismissing his wife's health needs as non-essential. Even if it's not as immediately critical as, say, rent, it's still part of her healthcare. The answer might depend on how essential the medication is. If it's prescribed and necessary, then categorizing it as non-essential could be seen as incorrect. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
