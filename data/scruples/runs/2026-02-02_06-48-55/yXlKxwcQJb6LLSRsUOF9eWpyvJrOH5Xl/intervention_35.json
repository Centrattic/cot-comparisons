We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple budgeting and the husband categorizing his wife's acne medication as non-essential. The wife argues it's essential, similar to her birth control, which the husband considers essential because it prevents unintended pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Acne medication can be more than just cosmetic; it can have psychological effects, impacting self-esteem and mental health. The wife mentions she would be in pain without it, which suggests it's medically necessary for her. On the other hand, birth control is clearly a medical necessity for preventing pregnancy and possibly managing other health issues. The husband's reasoning is that the acne medication isn't essential, but if it's prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, it should be considered essential.\n\nThen there's the fairness aspect. The wife argues it's unfair to make her use her non-essential budget for something she deems essential. If they're splitting budgets, expecting her to cover it from her non-essential part might not be fair if she needs it. The husband's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs. \n\nFinancial responsibility is also a factor. Both need to prioritize necessary expenses. If the acne medication is indeed a medical necessity, excluding it from necessary expenses could lead to bigger issues, like health complications or increased costs from untreated conditions. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might be trying to manage finances, but the approach could be causing conflict. It's possible he didn't consider the emotional or health impact of his decision. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a tendency to prioritize women's health in certain ways. Birth control is widely recognized as essential, so comparing it to acne medication might highlight that the latter is also important for her well-being. \n\nSo, putting this together, the husband (author) might be in the wrong by not recognizing the essential nature of the medication and not being empathetic to his wife's health needs. The answer would likely be A, but I need to make sure there's no other perspective where the husband is justified. Maybe if the medication isn't prescribed or is over-the-counter, but the scenario mentions it's her medication, implying it's prescribed. Therefore, he's dismissing a legitimate medical expense, which makes him the asshole.\n"
