We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not considering their wife's acne medication as a necessity. The situation is about budgeting and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the author and wife are trying to manage finances. The wife wants her acne medication listed as necessary, but the husband disagrees. He compares it to birth control, which he acknowledges as essential because it prevents an unplanned pregnancy. The wife argues that the acne medication is also essential for her, causing pain if she can't use it.\n\nI need to consider if acne medication is a necessary medical expense. Birth control is often considered essential due to its role in family planning, which the husband accepts. Acne treatments can be prescribed by doctors and are sometimes covered by insurance as medical expenses. However, over-the-counter options exist, but if the wife is using prescription medication, that's different. The husband is making her use her discretionary budget, which might not be fair if it's a prescribed medical need.\n\nThe wife's argument is that not having the medication causes her pain, which adds a health aspect. If the medication is part of her healthcare, it should be seen as necessary. The husband's stance might be seen as not valuing her health needs as much as other necessities. Even if birth control is essential for family planning, acne medication could be crucial for her mental health or self-esteem, which are valid considerations.\n\nSo, the husband categorizing the medication as non-essential might be in the wrong. He should consider discussing with the wife and maybe consulting a healthcare provider or financial advisor to properly categorize such expenses. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
