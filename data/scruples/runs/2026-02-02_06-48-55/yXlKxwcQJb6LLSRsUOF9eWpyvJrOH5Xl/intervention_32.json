We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a couple planning their finances. The husband considers his wife's acne medication as a non-essential expense, while she argues it's essential because her birth control is considered essential. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid having a child, but he doesn't see acne medication the same way. The wife says she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair for her to have to use her personal budget for something important.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if acne medication is an essential expense. Essential expenses are typically those necessary for health, safety, and basic living. Birth control is often categorized as essential because it's a medical necessity for family planning. Acne medication, especially if prescribed, could be part of mental health as well, affecting self-esteem and daily life. Chronic skin conditions can cause significant distress, so denying coverage might impact her well-being.\n\nThe husband is grouping it with non-essentials, which are things you can cut if needed. However, if the acne medication is part of her ongoing medical treatment, it's more like a necessary medical expense. The wife's argument that it's important for her health is valid. The husband's comparison to birth control being essential for preventing pregnancy might be valid, but that's a different type of necessity. The key here is whether the acne medication is a regular medical need or a cosmetic choice.\n\nIf the medication is over-the-counter, maybe it's seen as less essential. But if it's a prescription, especially if her dermatologist says it's necessary for her condition, then it's a medical expense. The wife is also pointing out fairness, as she's using her own budget for something that affects her health, which could be a sign that she's already prioritizing other non-essentials. \n\nThe husband's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs. Even if he's trying to be frugal, health-related expenses generally should be prioritized. The fact that she's in pain without it adds to the argument that it's essential. So, the husband might be in the wrong by not considering her medical needs as essential and not being supportive of her requirement for the medication. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
