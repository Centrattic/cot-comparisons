I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his wife are trying to manage their finances and list necessary expenses. The wife wants to include her acne medication as a necessity. The author thinks it's not essential and tells her to use her discretionary spending for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential (to avoid an unplanned pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. She mentions she'll be in pain without it and wants both of them to pay, saying it's unfair that she has to use her monthly budget for something so important.\n\nThe author is asking if he's at fault (AITA). The user says they think he is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider what's considered a necessary expense. Birth control is often seen as a necessity because it's for family planning and has health benefits. Acne medication, on the other hand, might be seen as cosmetic, but for some people, severe acne can affect mental health and well-being. The wife mentions she'll be in pain without it, which might indicate it's more than just cosmetic\u2014it could be a medical necessity if her acne is severe. \n\nThe author treats birth control as essential because it prevents unintended pregnancy, which is a valid point. But if the acne medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then it's similar to other medical necessities. The author is making a distinction between birth control (essential) and acne medication (non-essential), but that might be arbitrary. Both could be considered essential depending on the individual's needs.\n\nThe wife is asking for both to contribute to the cost, which the author is resisting. The author is making her use her personal budget for it, which she finds unfair. Financial responsibility often involves shared expenses, especially when it's for health. If the medication is part of her health, it might be reasonable to include it in necessary expenses, not as a discretionary item.\n\nThe author's reasoning that birth control is essential for avoiding kids is a bit self-centered. The necessity of birth control is not just about the author's preferences but the wife's health and family planning. Similarly, acne medication's necessity depends on the individual's health. If the author is not allowing it to be considered necessary, he's not acknowledging the wife's health needs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of fairness. The wife feels it's unfair to have to use her non-essential budget for something important. The author is not willing to share the cost, which might be seen as not supporting her health needs. In a partnership, sharing medical expenses, even if they're not life-threatening, is part of mutual support.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the acne medication as a necessary expense and by not being willing to share the financial responsibility. The wife's health and well-being are important, and if her dermatologist recommends the medication, it's a medical necessity. Therefore, the author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs, which would make him at fault.\n"
