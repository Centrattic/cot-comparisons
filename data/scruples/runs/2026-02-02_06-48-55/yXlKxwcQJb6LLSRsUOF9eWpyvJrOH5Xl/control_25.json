We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential. The situation is about budgeting and categorizing expenses. The wife argues it's essential because it's related to her health, similar to birth control. The author thinks birth control is essential to avoid having a kid, but acne meds aren't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's essential. Birth control is often considered a necessary medical expense because it's for reproductive health and preventing pregnancy. Acne medication, on the other hand, is more about skin health and quality of life. But if the wife is in pain, maybe it's a medical necessity. The question is whether the author is wrong for not seeing it that way.\n\nThe wife's argument is that if birth control is essential, so is her acne meds. But the author is differentiating based on the reason\u2014birth control prevents a child, while acne meds are for a skin condition. However, chronic pain from acne can be a real medical issue, and some people do need medication for that. So, the author might be dismissing her legitimate health needs by not categorizing it as essential.\n\nAlso, the wife mentions she's in pain without it. If that's the case, then it's more than just cosmetic. The author's reasoning might be flawed because they're comparing two different types of medications without considering the necessity of the acne meds for her health. The fairness argument is about splitting the cost, but the core issue is whether it's essential.\n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, if both are in agreement that birth control is essential, then acne medication should be considered similarly if it's medically necessary. The author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging that. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
