We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential. \n\nFirst, the couple is trying to cut down on expenses. The wife wants her acne meds listed as necessary, but the author disagrees. The wife argues that since birth control is essential (for not getting pregnant), acne meds should be too. The author's reasoning is that birth control is essential for avoiding an unintended pregnancy, which is a significant financial and life event. The wife mentions she'll be in pain without the medication and expects both to contribute.\n\nSo, is acne medication essential? It's not life-threatening like birth control, but chronic acne can affect mental health and self-esteem. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her well-being, maybe it's important to cover. However, essential vs. non-essential can be subjective. Birth control is often considered essential for reproductive health and family planning. Acne treatment might be seen as cosmetic unless it's causing severe issues. \n\nThe author's stance might be seen as not valuing their wife's health needs, while the wife feels her treatment is important. The key here is whether the author is dismissing a valid medical need. If the acne medication is part of her necessary healthcare, then the author might be wrong in not considering it essential. Alternatively, if the author is managing budgets and prioritizing based on their own judgment, maybe they're not wrong. But since the wife is experiencing pain, that could tip the balance towards it being essential. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not considering their wife's health needs, potentially causing her discomfort or distress. Essential items can include mental and physical health treatments, even if they're not life-saving. The wife's argument about using her own budget might not be fair if it's affecting her well-being. So the answer is A.\n"
