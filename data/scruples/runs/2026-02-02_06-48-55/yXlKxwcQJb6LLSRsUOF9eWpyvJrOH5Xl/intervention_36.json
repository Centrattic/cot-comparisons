We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about financial planning between a couple. The wife wants her acne medication to be considered a necessary expense, but the author (husband) doesn't think it is. The wife argues that her birth control is essential because it prevents pregnancy, and since acne medication is tied to her well-being, it should also be considered essential. The husband thinks it's non-essential and should come out of her discretionary spending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered a necessity in financial planning. Birth control is often classified as a medical necessity, especially if it's prescribed by a doctor. But acne medication can vary. Some people might see it as a cosmetic expense, while others might consider it medically necessary if it's prescribed for health reasons, like treating a skin condition. The wife mentions pain, which could indicate that her acne is severe and the medication is necessary for her physical or mental health. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid an unplanned pregnancy, which is a valid point. However, dismissing acne medication as non-essential might not take into account the medical necessity aspect. If the medication is prescribed, it's part of her healthcare, similar to other treatments. The wife's argument about fairness is also important\u2014using her personal budget for something she considers essential could create resentment or financial strain.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might be trying to manage their finances responsibly, but the way he's handling it could be dismissive of his wife's health needs. It's possible he's not considering the emotional or medical impact of not having the medication. The fact that she's in pain suggests it's more than just cosmetic. \n\nI should also think about financial responsibility. If they're overspending, cutting non-essentials makes sense, but if the acne medication is a medical necessity, it shouldn't be categorized under discretionary spending. The key here is whether the medication is truly necessary for her health, which might require consulting a healthcare provider. \n\nIn summary, the husband's stance might be based on a traditional view of necessities, but modern perspectives and medical advice could support the wife's position. If the medication is prescribed and essential for her well-being, the husband is in the wrong for not recognizing it as a necessary expense. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging his wife's medical needs and fairness in their financial planning.\n"
