We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is counting his wife's acne medication as non-essential, so she has to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential, her acne meds should be too. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid kids, while acne meds aren't. The wife says without the meds, she'll be in pain and it's unfair to make her pay from her non-essential funds.\n\nHmm. Acne can have psychological and physical effects. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it's likely considered medically necessary. Birth control is often seen as essential for family planning, so comparing the two might be valid. The husband's argument seems to prioritize practicality (preventing children) over other health needs. But the wife's point is about her health and well-being.\n\nI should consider if there's a difference in necessity. Birth control is preventive and has a clear purpose for avoiding pregnancy. Acne medication treats a medical condition. If the acne is causing her pain or significant emotional distress, then it's a valid medical need. The husband might be dismissing her health concerns by labeling it non-essential. That could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention is to manage finances.\n\nAlso, the wife is paying from her own budget for non-essentials, which might not be fair if it's a necessary expense for her. The husband's approach could be inflexible, not considering her individual needs. Financial planning needs to balance both practicality and personal health. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not acknowledging her legitimate medical need, treating it as a non-essential when it's essential for her well-being. The answer would be A.\n"
