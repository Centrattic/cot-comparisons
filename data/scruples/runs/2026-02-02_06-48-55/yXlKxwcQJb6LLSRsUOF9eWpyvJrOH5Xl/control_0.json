We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as a non-essential. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple is trying to manage their finances and cut down on non-essentials. The wife wants her acne medication listed as necessary. The husband argues it's not essential, unlike birth control, which he sees as essential to prevent kids. The wife counters that the medication is important for her health and that she shouldn't have to use her discretionary budget for it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Medical necessity, 2) Financial responsibility, and 3) Mutual respect in a relationship. \n\nAcne medication can be medically necessary, especially if it's prescribed by a doctor. If it's part of her treatment for a skin condition that affects her well-being, then it's not just a cosmetic expense. The husband might be conflating it with non-essentials because he doesn't see the immediate necessity, but for the wife, it's crucial for her health and possibly her mental health, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's perspective is that they need to prioritize expenses and maybe he sees non-essential items as things they can cut back on. However, by not recognizing the medication as essential, he might be ignoring her health needs. The fact that she's in pain without it adds weight to her argument that it's necessary.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that birth control is essential to avoid having a kid is a bit reductive. Birth control is a medical necessity for many women, not just for preventing pregnancy. It can manage menstrual cycles, reduce cramps, and other health benefits. Equating acne medication with non-essentials while considering birth control as essential might be inconsistent, especially if both are prescribed for medical reasons.\n\nAlso, the wife's point about fairness is important. If they have separate budgets for essentials and non-essentials, using her personal budget for something that's necessary for her health could be seen as unfair. The husband's approach might not be considering her perspective adequately, leading to a conflict in their financial planning.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband might need to understand why the medication is important to her and find a middle ground. Denying it as a necessary expense without considering her health could be seen as dismissive. So, the husband might be in the wrong here by not acknowledging the medical necessity and the emotional impact on his wife.\n"
