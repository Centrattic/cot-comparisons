We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their shared finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband thinks acne medication isn't essential, while the wife argues it's necessary, similar to birth control. She mentions she'll be in pain without it and feels it's unfair to put it in her non-essential budget. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to prevent kids, but acne meds aren't. \n\nHmm. Acne can have psychological effects and impact quality of life. If it's causing her pain or distress, maybe it's a valid health expense. On the other hand, birth control is also a health necessity, but they already categorize it as essential. The husband is treating acne meds as non-essential, which the wife disagrees with. \n\nI should consider if there's a difference in necessity between the two. Birth control is often covered by insurance as a preventive care, but acne meds might not be. However, the emotional and physical impact of acne shouldn't be dismissed. The wife's argument is about fairness and shared responsibility. The husband is making her use her personal budget, which she doesn't agree with. \n\nFinancial planning should involve mutual agreement. If they're in a partnership, both should agree on what's essential. The husband unilaterally deciding without considering her perspective might be the issue. Also, her needing it for her well-being is a valid point. So, the husband might not be wrong in his stance, but his approach could be flawed. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nIf acne medication is medically necessary for her health, then categorizing it as non-essential could be seen as dismissive. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a standard on this. Some people might see it as a personal choice, but others as necessary. Since the wife is experiencing pain, it's a health issue. Therefore, the husband's refusal to consider it essential might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
