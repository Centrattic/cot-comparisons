We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning their finances and debating whether the wife's acne medication should be considered a necessity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments on both sides. The author (he) thinks acne medication isn't essential and wants her to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential, her acne medication should be too. She mentions that she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair she has to pay from her monthly budget.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Classification of the medication as necessary. 2) The wife's health and well-being. 3) Fairness in financial responsibility.\n\nI should consider if acne medication is a medical necessity. Birth control is often seen as essential for preventing pregnancy, which has significant financial and life implications. Acne medication, especially prescription ones, can be crucial for a person's mental health and self-esteem. If the wife is using it for a medical reason rather than just cosmetic, then maybe it should be considered essential. \n\nThe author's reasoning that it's not essential might be dismissive of her health needs. Also, the wife is saying she'll be in pain without it. If that's true, then it's a health issue, not just a preference. The argument about fairness is important too. If both are sharing financial responsibilities, it's reasonable for him to contribute to her medical needs, especially if they're married and have joint expenses. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which I can relate to. But I should check if there's a valid point where acne medication isn't seen as essential. However, given that the wife is stating it's important for her, and if she's experiencing pain or significant health issues, then it's a necessity. The author might be underestimating the impact of her condition. \n\nAlso, in many households, medical expenses are shared unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. The wife's argument that he should contribute because it's essential like birth control makes sense. The author's stance could be seen as not supporting her health needs, which is a red flag in a partnership. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
