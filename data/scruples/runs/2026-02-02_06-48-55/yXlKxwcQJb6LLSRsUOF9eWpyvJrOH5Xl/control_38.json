We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple is budgeting and trying to cut non-essential expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential, but the husband disagrees, saying it's not essential. The wife argues that since birth control is essential, her acne med should be too. The husband counters that birth control is essential to avoid having a kid. The wife then says she'll be in pain without the medication and wants to split the cost.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Acne can have significant physical and emotional impacts. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it's part of her healthcare. Birth control is considered essential because it's a contraceptive, but acne treatment is also medical. The husband's view that it's non-essential might be dismissive of her health needs. However, from a budgeting perspective, if they're trying to cut expenses, maybe he sees it as optional. But the wife's health and well-being are important. If she's in pain without it, that's a valid concern. Also, splitting the cost could be a compromise. The husband's refusal to consider it essential might be seen as not supporting her health needs. On the other hand, maybe he's trying to be responsible with money. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the medication is necessary for her health, then not covering it could be considered wrong. So, answer A (yes) might be appropriate here. But I should check if there's a nuance I'm missing. For example, if the medication isn't prescribed or if there are alternatives, but the question doesn't mention that. The wife says she'll be in pain, implying it's necessary. So the husband's stance seems dismissive of her health needs, making him at fault.\n"
