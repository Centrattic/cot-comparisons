We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about financial planning between a husband and wife. The wife wants her acne medication counted as a necessary expense, but the husband disagrees, saying it's non-essential. The wife argues that since birth control is considered essential (because it's needed to prevent pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. She also mentions that she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair for her to have to use her non-essential budget for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered a necessity in healthcare. Birth control is often categorized as essential because it's a regular medical expense that's crucial for preventing unintended pregnancies, which can have significant health and financial implications. Acne medication, on the other hand, might be seen as more of a cosmetic expense unless it's prescribed for a medical condition. But wait, acne can sometimes be a medical issue, especially if it's severe or causing psychological distress. In that case, the medication might be considered necessary for health reasons.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that since birth control is essential for avoiding a child, which is a basic need, acne medication isn't. But the wife is arguing that her health is important too, and the medication helps her avoid pain or other issues. If the acne medication is prescribed by a doctor for a medical condition, then it might be considered essential. If it's over-the-counter, maybe not. However, even over-the-counter meds can be essential depending on individual circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness aspect. The wife feels it's unfair to use her non-essential budget for something she considers essential. The husband is categorizing expenses into necessary and non-necessary, but if the wife is in pain without the medication, that's a health issue, which should be prioritized. The husband's approach of cutting non-essentials might not account for personal health needs. Also, the wife's point about shared responsibility in finances\u2014since they're partners, splitting necessary medical expenses together makes sense, rather than making one person cover it alone.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong if the acne medication is indeed necessary for her health. If it's just for appearance, maybe not. But since the wife mentions pain, it's likely a medical necessity. Therefore, the husband's refusal to categorize it as essential could be seen as dismissive of her health needs. The answer would probably be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
