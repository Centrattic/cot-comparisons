We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple is budgeting and trying to cut costs. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential. The husband argues it's not essential, unlike birth control, which he sees as essential to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. The wife counters that without her medication, she's in pain, and it's important to her well-being.\n\nSo, the key points here are about what's considered essential. The husband is categorizing acne medication as non-essential, while the wife argues it's necessary for her health and comfort. \n\nI need to consider societal norms and common definitions of essential expenses. Essential usually includes things that are necessary for basic health and well-being. Birth control is often seen as essential for family planning, especially if it's required to prevent pregnancy. Acne medication might be more challenging because while it's important for skin health, it's sometimes viewed as cosmetic. However, chronic acne can have psychological impacts and may be medically necessary for some people. \n\nThe argument from the wife is that her medication is crucial for her well-being, similar to how birth control is essential. The husband's perspective is more about the necessity for preventing a child. There's a double standard here if the husband is allowing one essential expense but not another, even if both are important for health.\n\nAlso, the wife mentions using her non-essential budget for it, but the husband is categorizing it as non-essential. The fairness of the division might be an issue here. If both parties agree that something is necessary, even if it's not life-saving, it's reasonable to include it in essential expenses.\n\nIn terms of fairness and mutual respect in a partnership, dismissing the wife's health needs could be seen as inconsiderate. The husband isn't considering the emotional and physical impact acne has on her. It's possible he's prioritizing one essential expense over another based on his own values, without fully understanding her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong by not recognizing acne medication as essential. It's a health-related expense that's important for her quality of life. The answer would be A.\n"
