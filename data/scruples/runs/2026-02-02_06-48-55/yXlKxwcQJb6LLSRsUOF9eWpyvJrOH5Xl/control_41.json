We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as a non-essential expense. The key points here are the financial planning context and the specific items in question.\n\nFirst, the couple is trying to manage their finances to avoid overspending. They're categorizing expenses as necessary or non-essential. The wife argues that her acne medication is essential, comparing it to her birth control, which the author considers essential because it prevents an unplanned pregnancy. The author, however, sees acne medication as non-essential, directing her to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife counters that without the medication, she'll be in pain and finds it unfair to have to use her personal budget for something she deems important.\n\nNow, considering medical necessity. Birth control is often considered essential for many people, especially if it's preventing unintended pregnancies, which can have significant life impacts. Acne medication can also be essential, particularly if it's part of a medical treatment prescribed by a healthcare provider. Acne can affect mental health, self-esteem, and quality of life, so for some, managing it is as crucial as managing other health conditions. The line between essential and non-essential can be subjective here, especially if the acne is causing physical discomfort or emotional distress.\n\nThe author's position might stem from a practicality perspective, trying to prioritize expenses. However, dismissing a prescribed medication as non-essential without understanding its importance to the wife's well-being could be seen as insensitive or dismissive. The wife's argument that using her personal budget for it is unfair suggests that the author isn't acknowledging the medication's necessity from her perspective. This could lead to financial strain on her or compromise her health if she can't afford the medication otherwise.\n\nAdditionally, financial planning in a relationship often involves mutual agreement on what's essential. The author's refusal to consider the wife's viewpoint might undermine collaborative decision-making. The wife's mention of pain indicates that the medication is part of a necessary treatment, not just a cosmetic choice. If the medication is prescribed and necessary for her health, it's more in line with essential expenses. Therefore, the author's stance here could be seen as incorrect because they're not validating the wife's medical needs as essential.\n"
