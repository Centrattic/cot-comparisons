We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about budgeting and whether acne medication should be considered a necessity.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife are trying to manage their finances. The wife considers her acne medication essential, similar to how she considers birth control essential. The husband disagrees, saying it's a non-essential, but he does acknowledge that birth control is essential because it prevents unwanted pregnancy. \n\nNow, birth control is often medically necessary for various reasons beyond just preventing pregnancy, like managing hormonal issues. Acne medication might be considered necessary if it's a prescribed treatment for a medical condition that affects her health or quality of life. The wife also mentions she'll be in pain without it, which adds a health aspect.\n\nThe husband's argument is that acne medication is non-essential, but he's splitting the essentials into categories. If birth control is essential because of its role in preventing pregnancy (a practical necessity), but acne medication is for health reasons, there's a contradiction. Also, the wife argues that she shouldn't have to use her non-essential budget for something important to her, which relates to fairness in shared financial responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of medical necessity, both medications could be seen as essential depending on the individual's health needs. The husband's stance might be seen as dismissive of his wife's health concerns. Financial planning should consider both practical and health-related expenses. The wife's argument about fairness and shared responsibility is valid because if she's paying from her non-essential budget, it could create tension. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is being dismissive of his wife's health needs. If the acne medication is a prescribed treatment, then it's a medical necessity, not a luxury. The husband's initial categorization as non-essential might be incorrect. Also, if the birth control is essential, then acne medication, being another prescribed medication, should be treated similarly. \n\nThe husband's response about pain without the medication is something he should consider more seriously. Pain is a valid health issue that affects daily life and well-being. By not acknowledging it as essential, he's not supporting his wife's health needs adequately. Additionally, the way he's splitting the budget might not be equitable if he's allowing her to use her non-essential funds for something she considers essential. \n\nSo, the husband's reasoning seems flawed because he's not recognizing the medical necessity of the acne medication, especially when he already categorizes another prescribed medication (birth control) as essential. He should be more open to his wife's perspective and adjust the budget to cover both essential health expenses. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her health needs and for not considering the fairness in their financial arrangement.\n"
