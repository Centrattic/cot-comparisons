We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. They're trying to manage their finances and have a disagreement over categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife argues that her acne medication is essential, comparing it to her birth control, which the husband accepts as essential. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid having a child, so it's a necessity. For acne medication, he thinks it's not essential and she should use her non-essential budget for it.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The wife mentions she'll be in pain without the medication. Acne can be more than just a skin issue; it can affect mental health and self-esteem. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it might be considered medically necessary. The husband is treating it as non-essential, similar to how he treats other non-essential items. But the wife is using her non-essential budget for something she deems important for her well-being, which he's not allowing. \n\nIs the husband wrong here? Well, he's making a judgment about his wife's health needs. If the medication is part of her healthcare and necessary for her mental or physical health, then categorizing it as non-essential might be dismissive of her needs. Comparing it to non-essentials like maybe discretionary spending (e.g., dining out, hobbies) could be unfair. Also, if her birth control is considered essential because it's for preventing pregnancy, then medical treatments for health conditions should also be essential. The husband's stance seems to contradict the necessity of birth control. \n\nHowever, the husband's intention is to manage finances and avoid overspending. There's a balance between financial responsibility and supporting each other's health needs. If the medication is affordable within their budget, maybe there's a way to adjust other expenses. But if he's categorically refusing to consider it essential, that might be the issue. \n\nThe key points here are the necessity of medical treatments versus financial planning. The wife's argument is that her health is important, and the husband is not acknowledging that. The question is whether it's fair to label her medication as non-essential when it's part of her health care. Given that birth control is essential for preventing pregnancy, acne medication, if medically necessary, should be treated similarly. \n\nSo, the husband's reasoning might be flawed because he's not recognizing the medical necessity of the acne treatment. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not supporting his wife's health needs as essential, especially when he accepts her birth control as essential. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
