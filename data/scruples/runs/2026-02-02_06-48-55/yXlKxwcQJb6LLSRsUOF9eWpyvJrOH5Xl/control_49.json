We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the a**hole for not considering their wife's acne medication as a necessity. They're trying to budget and cut expenses. The wife wants the acne med included as a necessity, comparing it to her birth control, which the author does consider essential. The wife argues that without the med, she'll be in pain and that it's unfair she has to use her monthly budget for it. The author's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid an unplanned kid, but acne meds aren't as necessary.\n\nHmm. So, first, I should consider what's considered a necessity in financial planning. Birth control is often seen as a medical necessity, especially if it's prescribed by a doctor. Acne medication can also be medically necessary, depending on the severity. If the acne is causing significant discomfort or health issues, it's reasonable to categorize it as essential. The wife is saying she's in pain without it, which sounds like a medical issue that a doctor might address, so that's a point in her favor.\n\nThe author is splitting the difference between essential and non-essential expenses. They're saying birth control is essential because of the pregnancy prevention aspect, but the acne med is not. But if the acne med is also necessary for her health, then maybe the author is being dismissive. The wife is arguing that she shouldn't have to pay for it from her own budget because it's important for her well-being, which is a valid point. It seems like the author is not considering the medical necessity of the acne medication, which could be a mistake. Also, comparing it to birth control, which is another prescribed medication, makes the author's stance a bit inconsistent. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The couple is trying to budget together, but there's a disagreement on what's essential. The author's approach of putting it in the non-essential category might be causing conflict. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like discussing the importance with a healthcare provider or looking at the long-term costs of not treating the acne (like possible scarring or other complications). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they're dismissing their wife's medical needs, which could be just as important as birth control. The comparison to birth control is a bit flawed if both are prescribed medications necessary for health. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's a nuance. If the acne medication is over-the-counter and relatively cheap, maybe it's different from a prescribed medication. But the wife mentions it's causing pain, so it's likely prescribed. In that case, the author is not considering a necessary medical expense as essential, which is incorrect. So I think the answer is A.\n"
