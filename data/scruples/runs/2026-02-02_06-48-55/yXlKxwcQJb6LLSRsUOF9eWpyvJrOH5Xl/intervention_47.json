We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering their wife's acne medication as a non-essential expense, while the wife argues it should be considered essential like her birth control.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is managing finances and trying to cut non-essentials. They categorize the acne medication as non-essential. The wife argues that it's essential because she needs it for health reasons, similar to birth control, which the author does consider essential. The wife also mentions that she would be in pain without it and that she's using her monthly budget, which the author might see as a non-essential part of their finances.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong. Essential vs. non-essential is subjective. Birth control is essential for preventing pregnancy, which is a valid health and financial consideration (unplanned pregnancy). Acne medication is for skin health and can have psychological impacts on self-esteem. If the acne is severe and causing physical or emotional distress, it might be considered essential for the individual's well-being.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're trying to manage finances and cut non-essentials. However, the wife is arguing that her health needs should be prioritized. The author's dismissal of her medication as non-essential might be seen as not valuing her health concerns. Also, the wife's point about fairness\u2014using her own monthly budget for something she views as essential\u2014could indicate the author isn't considering her perspective adequately.\n\nAnother angle: Birth control is a regular expense with a clear necessity (preventing pregnancy), whereas acne medication's necessity is more individual. But if the acne is affecting her quality of life significantly, it's comparable. The author's decision to categorize it as non-essential might be the problem here, especially if it's medically necessary for her. The author might be failing to see that health needs can vary and that what's non-essential for one person could be essential for another based on their circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is using the same budget category for both birth control and acne meds, but the wife argues they should be treated differently. The author's stance might be seen as inflexible, not acknowledging that health needs can be essential even if not life-saving in an emergency. The wife's pain and well-being are valid, so the author's refusal to adjust the budget might be the issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if the acne medication is indeed essential for the wife's health. The answer would depend on whether the medication is medically necessary. If it's prescribed and significantly impacts her well-being, then yes, the author is in the wrong. If it's more of a cosmetic issue, maybe not. But given the wife mentions pain, it's likely medically necessary. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
