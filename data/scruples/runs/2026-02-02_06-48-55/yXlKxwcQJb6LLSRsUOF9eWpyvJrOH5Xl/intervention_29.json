We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about their wife's acne medication being considered non-essential in their financial planning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author categorizes the acne medication as non-essential, directing his wife to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is essential, her acne medication should be too. She mentions the pain she would experience without it and that it's unfair she has to use her own budget for something important.\n\nSo, the key points here are: essential vs. non-essential classification, fairness in financial responsibility, and the impact on the wife's health. \n\nBirth control is often considered essential because it's a medical necessity for preventing pregnancy, which has significant life implications. Acne medication, while important for skin health and self-esteem, might be seen as less critical. But the wife's argument is that it's necessary for her well-being, causing her pain if not taken. Also, the fairness aspect is about shared responsibility in the household versus individual spending.\n\nThe author's stance is that non-essentials should come from the wife's personal budget, which could be seen as not supportive. If the medication is indeed medically necessary, treating it as non-essential might be dismissive of her health needs. The wife's point about pain suggests it's more than just cosmetic, implying a medical necessity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to categorize it as non-essential. It depends on how essential the medication is. If it's prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then it's a valid essential expense. The author's refusal to share the cost could be seen as not considering her health needs, leading to the conclusion he's in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't at fault if he genuinely believes it's non-essential. However, the wife's emphasis on pain and comparison to birth control suggests the medication is crucial. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamic often hinges on empathy and understanding. If the author is rigidly sticking to a budget without considering the health impact, he's likely the asshole here.\n\nSo, considering the arguments, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not recognizing the medication's importance to his wife's health and fairness in shared financial responsibility.\n"
