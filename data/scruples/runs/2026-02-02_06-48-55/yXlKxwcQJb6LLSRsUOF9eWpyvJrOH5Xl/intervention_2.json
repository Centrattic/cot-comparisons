We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the couple is trying to manage their finances and categorize expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential, similar to her birth control. The husband argues that birth control is essential to avoid unwanted pregnancy, while acne medication isn't. The wife counters that the medication is necessary for her well-being and that she shouldn't have to use her non-essential budget for it.\n\nNow, I need to consider what's essential. Birth control is typically seen as a medical necessity for managing reproductive health and preventing pregnancy. Acne medication, on the other hand, might be more about cosmetic or quality of life. However, acne can have psychological effects and may be prescribed by a doctor, so it's not purely cosmetic. The wife mentions pain, which could indicate that her acne is severe and requires treatment for her physical or mental health.\n\nThe husband's stance is that non-essentials can be covered from her personal budget, but the wife feels it's unfair. This raises questions about how they allocate budgets. If they have separate budgets, maybe the husband is being rigid. Also, if the medication is necessary for her health, it should be considered essential regardless of the category.\n\nI should also think about financial partnership. In a healthy relationship, both parties should support each other's health needs. The husband's refusal might be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. Maybe he's not considering the emotional or health impact of untreated acne. The fact that she's in pain suggests it's more than just cosmetic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If acne medication is crucial for her well-being, then categorizing it as non-essential could be unfair. The husband's argument that birth control is essential because it prevents pregnancy is valid, but that doesn't mean other medical needs aren't. The key is whether acne treatment is a medical necessity for her. If it's prescribed and necessary, then it should be treated as essential. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that.\n"
