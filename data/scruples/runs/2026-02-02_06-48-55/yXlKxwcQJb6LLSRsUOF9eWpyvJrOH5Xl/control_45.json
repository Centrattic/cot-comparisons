We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessary expense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband and wife are budgeting and trying to cut costs. The husband is categorizing his wife's acne medication as non-essential, while she argues it's essential, similar to her birth control. The husband sees birth control as essential to avoid having a child, but doesn't see acne medication the same way.\n\nThe wife mentions she might be in pain without the medication. So, the key points here are: Is acne medication considered a necessary medical expense? How does it compare to other medications like birth control?\n\nBirth control is often seen as a preventive measure for both health and family planning, which might be considered more essential in terms of avoiding unintended pregnancy. Acne medication, on the other hand, could be viewed as a treatment for a cosmetic issue unless it's causing significant physical or psychological distress. However, acne can lead to scarring and affect mental health, so it's not purely cosmetic for everyone.\n\nThe husband's argument is that the wife should use her non-essential budget for the medication. But if the medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then it might be considered essential. The wife's point about fairness and splitting the cost could also be a factor in their relationship dynamics.\n\nLooking at financial responsibility, essential expenses are typically those that are necessary for health and well-being. If the acne medication is prescribed and necessary for her health, then excluding it from the essential list might be seen as unfair. The husband's stance could be seen as dismissive of her health needs, especially if she's experiencing pain or emotional distress without the medication.\n\nOn the other hand, budgeting requires prioritizing. If they're overspending, they might need to make tough choices. But if the medication is part of her healthcare and not optional, then it's in the husband's wrong to classify it as non-essential. The comparison to birth control is valid because both are medical expenses; the difference is the purpose. However, both are important for the individual's health.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is being asked to pay from her non-essential budget, which might be for things like entertainment, it's not equitable if the medication is necessary. The husband might be in the wrong for not recognizing the medication's importance and for not sharing the financial responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging the necessity of the medication for his wife's health and well-being, which is a key part of essential expenses.\n"
