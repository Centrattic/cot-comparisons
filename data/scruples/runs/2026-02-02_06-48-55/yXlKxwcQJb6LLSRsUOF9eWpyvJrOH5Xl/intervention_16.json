We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential. The situation involves financial planning where they're categorizing expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential, similar to her birth control. The author argues that birth control is essential to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, but acne medication isn't. The wife counters that she would be in pain without it and that it's important for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity of acne medication. While it's not life-threatening like some medications, chronic skin conditions can have significant physical and emotional impacts. Acne can cause pain, scarring, and affect mental health. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it might be considered necessary for her well-being. Birth control is also a medical necessity, but in this case, the author is treating it as essential for financial reasons (avoiding unplanned pregnancy), which might be a different perspective than the medical necessity angle.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since birth control is essential for their financial stability (preventing a kid), acne medication isn't. But the wife is arguing that her health and comfort are equally important. There's a double standard here if the author is applying different criteria to different medications. The wife's argument is about her quality of life versus the author's financial logic.\n\nFinancial planning should ideally consider both parties' health needs. Dismissing a spouse's necessary medication as non-essential could be seen as not valuing their health. The key is whether the acne medication is a prescribed treatment and how critical it is for her. If it's prescribed and necessary for her health, categorizing it as non-essential might be unfair. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing financial planning over the wife's health needs, which might make them at fault. However, if the medication is over-the-counter and not prescribed, the argument might be different. But since the wife is using it for a chronic condition, it's likely prescribed. \n\nAlso, the wife's point about fairness and shared responsibility in the budget is valid. She's not asking to use her own money for an unnecessary item but for something she deems essential. The author's refusal to categorize it as such without a clear medical justification could be seen as not supporting her health needs. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they are not recognizing the medical necessity of the acne medication and are applying a different standard compared to birth control. The wife's health and well-being should be a priority in financial planning. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
