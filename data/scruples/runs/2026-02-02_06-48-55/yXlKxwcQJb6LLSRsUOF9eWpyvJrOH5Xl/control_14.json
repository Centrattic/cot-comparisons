We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife is saying that her acne medication is essential, similar to her birth control. She argues that without it, she'll be in pain. The husband sees birth control as essential because it prevents an unplanned pregnancy, which makes sense from a financial and life planning perspective. But he's saying acne meds aren't essential and she should use her non-essential budget for them.\n\nHmm. Acne can have a significant impact on someone's mental health and self-esteem. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, maybe it's considered a necessary medical expense. However, the husband might be categorizing it differently compared to birth control. He's using the reason that birth control is essential to avoid a child, which is practical, but maybe he's not considering the psychological and physical discomfort from untreated acne.\n\nAlso, the wife is saying she has to use her personal budget for this, which might be about fairness. If both birth control and acne meds are necessary for her health, why is one categorized as essential and the other not? That could be a point where the husband is being inconsistent.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is trying to prioritize expenses. If they're overspending, he might be trying to cut where possible. But if the acne medication is a regular expense and crucial for her well-being, cutting it might lead to more expenses later, like higher medical costs if her acne worsens, or the emotional toll affecting their relationship.\n\nIt also depends on cultural or societal views. Some might see skincare as less essential than reproductive health, but others argue that mental health and physical comfort are equally important. The key here is whether the medication is genuinely necessary, not just a personal preference. If the doctor prescribed it, then it's a medical necessity regardless of the husband's opinion.\n\nSo, the husband's categorization might be incorrect if the medication is part of her regular treatment for a health condition. The wife's argument that it's not fair to have to use her non-essential funds when it's important for her health could mean the husband is in the wrong by not recognizing it as essential. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
