We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessary expense. The author and his wife are budgeting and trying to cut costs, so they're categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the author is saying acne meds aren't essential, but his wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential (to prevent pregnancy), her acne meds should be too. The wife mentions she'll be in pain without it, which adds a health aspect. The author counters that birth control is essential for not having a kid, implying that acne meds aren't as important.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: 1) Is acne medication a medical necessity? 2) How does that compare to other medications? The wife's birth control is essential for her to avoid an unplanned pregnancy, which is a clear necessity. If her acne medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health and well-being, then it's reasonable to consider it essential. The author is treating it as a non-essential, which could be seen as dismissive of her health needs. Also, the wife is asking for fairness in the budget, saying she shouldn't have to use her discretionary funds for something essential. \n\nLooking at it from a fairness angle, if both partners have their essential needs covered, then it's better for the relationship. The author might be right in trying to manage finances, but if the medication is indeed necessary, then refusing to categorize it as essential could be unfair. The fact that the wife is in pain without it suggests it's more than a cosmetic issue. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by not recognizing the medical necessity of her acne medication, similar to how birth control is essential.\n"
