We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. The situation involves financial planning where they're listing necessary expenses. The wife argues that her acne medication is essential, similar to her birth control, which the husband accepts as essential because it prevents pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered essential. Birth control is typically seen as essential because it's for reproductive health and preventing unintended pregnancy. Acne medication, on the other hand, might be viewed differently. Acne isn't life-threatening, but it can have significant psychological effects, leading to low self-esteem or depression for some people. However, the husband's stance is that it's non-essential compared to other needs.\n\nThe wife's argument is that without the medication, she'll be in pain, which is a bit confusing because acne usually causes discomfort but not severe pain. Maybe she means emotional or social pain? She's also saying that the cost should be shared and not come from her personal budget. \n\nNow, considering that birth control is essential for her health and family planning, it's reasonable to consider acne medication differently. But there's a nuance here. If the acne is severe and the medication is medically necessary, it might be more justified. However, the husband's reasoning might not fully consider the importance of mental health and quality of life aspects related to skin conditions. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is dismissing something that's important for his wife's well-being. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor and is necessary for her mental health, then it could be considered essential in a broader sense. However, if it's for mild acne, then maybe not. But the wife is emphasizing its importance similarly to birth control, which the husband accepted as essential. \n\nThe husband's response might be seen as not fully empathizing with her needs, treating her health issue as secondary. By not considering shared responsibility, it could be unfair, as financial decisions should be made collaboratively. The fact that the wife feels the need to use her personal budget for something she deems important might lead to resentment. \n\nIn terms of fairness, sharing the cost makes sense if the medication is important for her mental health. The husband's initial categorization might not account for the emotional impact. So, the author could be in the wrong for not acknowledging the emotional and psychological necessity of the medication, even if it's not a life-threatening condition. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
