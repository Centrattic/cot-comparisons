We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for not considering his wife's acne medication as a necessity. They're trying to manage their finances and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the wife is saying her acne medication is essential, similar to how birth control is essential. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid having a child, so acne meds aren't. The wife argues that without the medication, she'll be in pain and it's unfair to make her pay from her non-essential budget.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is acne medication a necessity? It's a medical expense, but it's for a condition that's not life-threatening. However, mental health and self-esteem can be affected, which some might consider important. The husband is categorizing it as non-essential, but the wife disagrees. The question is about fairness and necessity.\n\nThe husband's stance might be seen as dismissive of his wife's health needs. Even if it's not as critical as birth control in their situation, it's still a medical expense. The wife's argument that she can't use her non-essential budget for something important might be valid. The husband's reasoning could come off as prioritizing one necessity (birth control) over another (acne meds), but maybe he's not considering the impact on her well-being.\n\nFinancial priorities can be subjective, but when it comes to health, especially if the medication is prescribed and necessary for her condition, it might be considered a necessity. The fact that she's experiencing pain without it adds to the argument. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not recognizing it as essential. But maybe there's a middle ground where they adjust budgets instead of cutting it entirely.\n\nHowever, the husband's intent is to manage finances, so maybe he's trying to be practical. But if the medication is part of her health care, not paying for it could be seen as neglecting her needs. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on what's essential. But given that medical treatments are generally considered necessary, the husband could be in the wrong for not acknowledging that.\n"
