We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not counting their wife's acne medication as a necessity. The situation involves financial planning where they're trying to cut down on non-essentials. The wife wants her acne meds listed as essential, comparing it to birth control. The husband argues that birth control is essential to avoid having a kid, but acne meds aren't. The wife counters that without it, she'll be in pain and it's unfair to make her pay from her budget.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the classification of expenses as essential vs. non-essential. The husband is labeling acne medication as non-essential, but the wife disagrees. The question is whether this classification is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's typically considered essential. Birth control is often considered essential because it's preventive healthcare, especially if it's for contraception and hormonal balance. Acne medication can vary. For some, especially if it's prescribed and necessary for their health and mental well-being, it might be considered essential. Acne can have psychological impacts, leading to low self-esteem, anxiety, etc., so treating it can be medically necessary for some individuals.\n\nThe husband's stance is that only the most basic necessities like food, housing, utilities are essential, and that healthcare is only essential if it's for survival. But the wife is arguing that her medication is crucial for her health, similar to birth control. The comparison to birth control is a good one because both are medical treatments, but one is for preventing pregnancy and the other for a skin condition. However, if the acne medication is a medical necessity for the wife, then it's reasonable to consider it essential.\n\nThe husband is categorizing it as non-essential, which could be seen as dismissive of his wife's health needs. By not allowing her to allocate the necessary funds and instead making her use the non-essential budget, he's not supporting her medical needs. This could be seen as unfair and inconsiderate, especially if the medication is indeed essential for her well-being.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is about shared responsibility. If they're in a partnership, splitting costs based on necessity is important. The wife's argument that she shouldn't have to pay from her personal budget for something essential is valid. The husband's approach might be leading to financial strain on her and could affect their relationship if she feels her health is being undervalued.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the medical necessity of the acne medication, similar to birth control. Therefore, he's not supporting his wife's health in a shared financial responsibility context. The answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
