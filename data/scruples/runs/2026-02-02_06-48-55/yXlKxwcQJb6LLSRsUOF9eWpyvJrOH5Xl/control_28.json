We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget. The wife argues it's essential, similar to birth control, which the husband sees as necessary to avoid having a kid. The husband categorizes acne medication as non-essential, so the wife wants to split the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Birth control is often considered a medical necessity for family planning and can have health implications. Similarly, acne medication can be crucial for mental health and self-esteem. If the wife is in pain without it, that's a sign it's affecting her well-being, which is a valid reason to treat it as essential. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is necessary to avoid unintended pregnancy, which is a financial and practical concern. However, dismissing acne medication as non-essential might overlook its importance to her mental health and daily life.\n\nThe key points are: Is acne medication a medical necessity? Does the wife's well-being depend on it? The husband's stance seems to undervalue her health needs. The wife is asking for shared responsibility, which makes sense if both are necessary. The husband's budgeting approach might be inflexible. The question is whether it's fair to consider acne medication non-essential when it significantly impacts her quality of life. \n\nIn many cases, medications for chronic conditions or those affecting mental health are classified as necessary, even if not life-saving. Since the wife is experiencing pain and distress, it's reasonable to see it as essential. The husband's refusal to adjust the budget might be seen as not supporting her health needs adequately. Therefore, the author (husband) could be in the wrong for not recognizing the medication's necessity and not being willing to find a compromise.\n"
