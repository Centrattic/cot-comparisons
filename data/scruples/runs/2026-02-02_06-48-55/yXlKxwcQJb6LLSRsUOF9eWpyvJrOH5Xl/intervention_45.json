We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not considering his wife's acne medication as a necessity.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're budgeting and deciding what's essential. The wife wants her acne med listed as essential, but the author says it's non-essential. The wife argues that since birth control is essential, her acne med should be too. The author counters that birth control is essential to avoid kids. The wife says she'll be in pain without the med and that it's unfair to use her personal budget for it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about what's considered a necessity. The author is categorizing acne medication as non-essential, but the wife is pushing back. Now, in terms of medical needs, acne can have significant health impacts beyond just aesthetics. It can lead to scarring, and for some people, it's a chronic condition affecting mental health and self-esteem. So, maybe the author is dismissing a medical necessity. \n\nOn the other hand, birth control is also a necessity, but the author is making a distinction here. The wife's argument is that if birth control is essential, then her acne medication should be too. The author's reasoning is that birth control is necessary to prevent pregnancy, which is a different type of necessity. But maybe the author isn't considering the health implications of not treating acne. \n\nAlso, the wife mentions she'll be in pain. Acne can be painful, and the medication might be necessary for her well-being. If the author is using a strict definition of \"necessity\" that only includes things preventing immediate health issues, maybe he's not seeing the broader impact of chronic conditions like acne. \n\nThe fairness aspect is another angle. The wife is saying it's unfair that she has to use her personal budget for something important. The author's approach might be seen as splitting responsibilities unevenly, especially if the medication is a shared responsibility in their household. \n\nI think the author's stance is a bit narrow. Essential vs. non-essential can be subjective, and healthcare needs are often considered essential. Acne medication, especially if prescribed by a doctor, might be part of medical expenses that should be prioritized. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
