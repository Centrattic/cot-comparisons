We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. They're trying to manage their finances and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, the wife's argument is that since birth control is essential (which they agree on), her acne medication should be too. She mentions it's important for her and that she'll be in pain without it. The husband counters that birth control is essential to avoid an unplanned pregnancy, implying acne meds aren't as critical.\n\nNow, acne medication can be important for mental health and self-esteem, but it's not typically life-saving like birth control or basic needs (food, shelter). However, some might argue that chronic skin conditions can have significant psychological effects, making the medication necessary for quality of life. The wife's point about fairness and the monthly budget is about how the cost is being allocated.\n\nBut the key here is the definition of \"essential.\" If their budgeting system allows for some non-essentials, maybe acne meds fall into a gray area. However, if the medication is prescribed and necessary for her well-being, even if not life-threatening, it might be considered essential. The husband's stance might overlook the emotional and psychological impact, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, if they're both contributing to non-essentials, maybe splitting the cost is fair. The husband's reasoning might be seen as dismissive of her health needs, especially if the medication is prescribed and necessary. But without more context on their financial situation, it's hard to say. Overall, the husband might be in the wrong for not recognizing the medication's importance to her well-being, even if it's not life-saving.\n"
