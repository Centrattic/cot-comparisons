We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife are trying to manage their finances and cut down on non-essential expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as necessary, but the husband disagrees. The husband argues that it's not essential, unlike birth control, which he sees as necessary to avoid an unexpected pregnancy. The wife counters that the medication is important for her health and she's in pain without it, and she feels it's unfair to make her use her personal budget for it.\n\nHmm, essential vs. non-essential. Birth control is often considered a necessary medical expense because it's a form of contraception and sometimes used for health reasons. Acne medication might be seen as more of a cosmetic expense unless it's prescribed for a medical condition. But the wife mentions being in pain, which suggests it's not just about appearance. If the acne is causing physical pain or has a medical basis, then maybe it's more necessary than a discretionary item.\n\nThe husband is categorizing it as non-essential, but the wife is arguing that it's essential for her well-being. The fairness aspect is also there\u2014she's using her own budget for something she considers necessary. The husband's reasoning seems to be based on the necessity of avoiding pregnancy versus managing a skin condition. \n\nBut birth control's necessity is clear for preventing pregnancy, which is a major financial and life decision. Acne medication's necessity might depend on the severity. If it's a medical need beyond just aesthetics, it's more justified as essential. Also, splitting the cost as a couple might be more equitable if it's truly necessary for her health. \n\nThe husband might be in the wrong if he's dismissing a legitimate medical need. The wife's point about fairness and the impact on her health could outweigh the husband's view of it being non-essential. So, perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
