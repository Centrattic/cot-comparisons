We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for considering his wife's acne medication as non-essential. They're trying to manage finances and have been overspending. The wife wants her acne meds listed as essential, comparing it to her birth control, which the husband accepts as essential because it prevents pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. Acne medication can be important for mental health and well-being, especially if it's causing her discomfort or pain. But the husband is arguing that it's non-essential, unlike birth control, which has a clear medical necessity. However, the wife is saying that without her meds, she'll be in pain, which might affect her quality of life.\n\nIt's possible that the husband isn't considering the emotional and physical impact of her acne. Birth control is essential because it's a contraceptive, but acne medication might be essential for her mental health. Maybe there's a lack of understanding here about how acne can affect someone's self-esteem and daily life. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to manage finances and prioritize expenses. If they're overspending, cutting non-essentials is part of that. But if the acne medication is prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then it might be considered essential. \n\nThe key here is whether the acne medication is a medical necessity. If it's prescribed as part of a treatment plan and the wife needs it to function normally, then not covering it could be seen as inconsiderate. The husband's stance might be dismissive of her health needs. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the husband is in the wrong) because he's not recognizing the importance of the medication for his wife's health. However, some might argue that birth control is more critical since it prevents unintended pregnancies. But the wife's argument is that her acne med is as essential to her as birth control is to managing her reproductive health. \n\nI think the husband is in the wrong here because he's categorizing something as non-essential that his wife finds crucial to her well-being. It's a matter of perspective and empathy. Financial planning should account for both parties' health needs.\n"
