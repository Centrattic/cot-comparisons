We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not considering their wife's acne medication as a necessity. The situation is about managing finances and categorizing expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is trying to budget and cut down on non-essential expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential. The husband argues it's not essential, unlike birth control, which he sees as essential to avoid having a child. The wife counters that the medication is important for her health and causes her pain if not taken, so she thinks it should be a joint responsibility.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) What's considered essential? 2) The comparison between birth control and acne medication. 3) The wife's argument about the necessity and financial responsibility.\n\nAcne medication can vary in necessity. For some people, it's crucial for their mental health and well-being, especially if it's affecting their self-esteem or causing physical discomfort. However, others might see it as a luxury compared to other medical needs. Birth control is often seen as essential for family planning, which is a common societal view. But the wife's argument is that her acne medication is equally important for her personal health.\n\nThe husband is categorizing it as non-essential, which could be problematic if it's affecting her health. The wife's point about splitting the cost might be about fairness in sharing expenses. If the husband is willing to pay for birth control but not her acne medication, that could create an imbalance, especially if she's using her own budget for it, leading to potential financial strain on her.\n\nI also need to consider healthcare perspectives. Medical treatments for chronic conditions are often considered necessary, even if they're not life-threatening. Acne can be a chronic issue that affects quality of life significantly. If her doctor has prescribed it as necessary, then it's a legitimate medical expense. The husband's stance might be dismissive of her health needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might be trying to prioritize expenses based on his own understanding. He might not realize the impact acne has on her life. There's also the aspect of communication. Maybe they need to discuss more openly why each expense is essential and find a compromise.\n\nBut from an outsider's view, if the medication is prescribed and necessary for her well-being, refusing to cover it could be seen as not supporting her health. The wife's argument that it's a shared responsibility makes sense if they're in a partnership. So the husband might be in the wrong by not recognizing the necessity and fairness in splitting the cost.\n"
