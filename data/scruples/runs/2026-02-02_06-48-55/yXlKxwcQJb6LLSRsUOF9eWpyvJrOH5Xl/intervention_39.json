We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding their wife's acne medication.\n\nThe situation is about financial planning. The couple is listing necessary expenses. The wife wants her acne medication counted as necessary, but the husband disagrees, calling it non-essential. He argues that birth control is essential because it prevents kids, but acne meds aren't. The wife counters that the medication is important for her health and causes pain if not taken, and she shouldn't have to use her discretionary budget for it.\n\nI need to determine if the husband is at fault here. Let's break it down. Acne medication can be crucial for some people's mental health and self-esteem, which are valid health concerns. The wife is experiencing pain without it, which sounds like a significant issue. The husband is categorizing it as non-essential, similar to how birth control is considered essential for preventing pregnancy. But maybe the husband isn't considering the health impact of the acne medication. Also, the wife is saying she can't afford it from her discretionary budget, which might indicate that the medication is a necessary expense she can't cut.\n\nThe husband's reasoning might be flawed because he's comparing birth control (which is essential for preventing unintended pregnancy) to acne medication, which is essential for her health. The fact that she's in pain without it adds weight to her argument. The husband might not be empathizing with her health needs, treating her medical expenses as non-essential when they are necessary for her well-being.\n\nFinancial planning should allow for both partners' health needs. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it's likely a necessary expense. The husband's refusal to categorize it as such might be seen as dismissive of her health. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong by not recognizing the medication as essential and not supporting her in covering the cost fairly.\n"
