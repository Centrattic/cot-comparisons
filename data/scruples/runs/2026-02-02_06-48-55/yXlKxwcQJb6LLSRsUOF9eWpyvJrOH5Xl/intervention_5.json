We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether acne medication counts as a necessary expense.\n\nFirst, the couple is budgeting and trying to cut down on non-essentials. The wife wants to include her acne medication as a necessity. The author argues it's not essential, but the wife compares it to birth control, which he sees as essential to avoid having a child. She says without the medication, she'll be in pain and wants to split the cost.\n\nHmm. The key here is what's considered a necessity. Birth control is often seen as essential because it's a medical need with significant consequences if not met. Acne medication might be a bit different. But wait, acne can have health impacts too, like skin health and mental well-being. If the medication is prescribed by a doctor, maybe it's considered a medical necessity. The wife's argument is that it's important for her health, similar to how birth control is necessary for her. \n\nThe author's reasoning for not including it is that it's non-essential, but he might be overlooking the medical aspect. If the medication is part of a prescribed treatment plan, it could be a healthcare expense, which is typically considered necessary. The wife's point about using her personal budget when she's in pain suggests that she's being asked to bear the cost herself even though it's important for her health. \n\nSo, maybe the author is being short-sighted. By not recognizing the medical necessity of the acne medication, he's not supporting his wife's health needs. The comparison to birth control is valid because both are medical treatments. The author's stance might be based on a misunderstanding of what's essential in healthcare. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the medication's role in her health as essential.\n"
