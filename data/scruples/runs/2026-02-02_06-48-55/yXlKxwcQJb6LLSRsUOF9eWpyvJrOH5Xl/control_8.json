I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning their finances and whether acne medication should be considered a necessity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband considers acne medication as non-essential because they're trying to cut down on spending. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential (as it's necessary for preventing pregnancy), her acne medication should also be essential because it's important for her health and well-being. She mentions she would be in pain without it, which might relate to the physical discomfort or the psychological impact of untreated acne.\n\nNow, I should consider medical perspectives. Birth control is often seen as essential because it's a preventive measure for pregnancy and can have health benefits. Acne medication, while not life-threatening, can have significant impacts on a person's quality of life, self-esteem, and mental health. If the acne is severe, medications like isotretinoin (Accutane) are prescribed to prevent scarring and reduce severe symptoms. So, medically, if the medication is prescribed by a doctor, it might be considered a necessary expense for the individual's health.\n\nOn the financial side, the husband is trying to manage their budget by categorizing expenses. Labeling something as non-essential could be part of a strategy to cut costs, but if it's a necessary medical expense, that might not be fair. The wife is pointing out the inconsistency of considering birth control essential but not acne medication, especially since both are prescribed medications. The husband's reasoning is based on the necessity for preventing pregnancy, but the wife's point is about her personal health needs.\n\nAnother angle is about fairness in shared financial responsibilities. If the couple is splitting expenses, it might be reasonable for both to contribute to necessary medical expenses. The wife feels it's unfair to have to use her non-essential budget for something she considers essential. This could lead to resentment if her health needs are being treated as non-essential while other prescribed medications are not.\n\nI should also consider societal norms. In many cases, mental health and chronic condition management are recognized as necessary, even if not immediately life-threatening. Acne can be more than just a skin issue; it can lead to depression or anxiety if left untreated. Therefore, the medication might be a necessary part of her healthcare.\n\nHowever, there might be arguments that some acne treatments are over-the-counter and less expensive, so if the medication is prescription and costly, that's different. The scenario mentions it's her acne medication, so it's likely a prescribed treatment. The key here is whether it's medically necessary for her, which a healthcare provider would determine.\n\nIn terms of the husband's perspective, he's trying to be prudent with their finances. But if the medication is a recognized medical necessity, then not covering it could be seen as prioritizing budget over health. The wife's argument that she would be in pain without it adds a physical component to her case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's stance might be based on a narrow definition of essential expenses (like birth control for preventing pregnancy) versus recognizing broader health impacts. The wife's point about the necessity of her medication for her well-being is valid, and the husband dismissing it as non-essential could be seen as inconsiderate of her health needs. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the medical necessity of the acne medication, similar to how birth control is treated.\n"
