We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple planning their finances and arguing over whether acne medication should be considered a necessity. The husband is saying it's not essential and wants his wife to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is considered essential (to prevent pregnancy), her acne medication should be too. She also mentions she'll be in pain without it and that it's unfair to make her pay from her monthly budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's essential. Birth control is often seen as a necessary medical expense, especially if it's for contraception and prevents unintended pregnancy. Acne medication can vary in necessity. For some people, it's just for appearance, but for others, severe acne can lead to scarring or psychological issues, making it medically necessary. The wife might be in the latter category here, especially since she mentions pain, which might indicate a more severe condition rather than just mild acne.\n\nThe husband's stance is that only things like housing, food, utilities, and maybe basic healthcare are essential. But birth control is already on the essential list because of its role in family planning. If acne medication is prescribed by a doctor and is necessary for her health, then it's similar to other medical expenses. The fact that she's in pain suggests it's more than just cosmetic; it's affecting her physical well-being.\n\nThe wife is also pointing out the fairness of the situation. She's being asked to use her non-essential budget for something she considers essential, which might not be equitable. In financial planning, both partners' health needs should be considered. The husband is prioritizing some things over others without fully understanding the medical necessity of the acne medication.\n\nI should also think about insurance coverage. If the medication is covered by insurance, maybe the out-of-pocket cost isn't as high, but the scenario doesn't mention insurance. If it's not covered, the cost could be a burden. However, if it's a regular expense that's necessary for her health, it should be categorized as essential.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband might not fully grasp the impact of his wife's condition. He's focusing on the financial categorization without considering her health perspective. The wife is trying to explain its importance, but he's dismissing it as non-essential. This could lead to resentment and stress in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both partners are contributing to necessary expenses, the wife shouldn't have to dip into her personal budget for something that's essential for her health. The husband's approach might be seen as not valuing her health needs equally with other essentials like birth control.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not considering the medical necessity of the acne medication, especially when the wife is experiencing pain and comparing it to an already accepted essential medication. By not seeing it as essential, he's potentially undermining her health and creating an unfair financial burden on her.\n"
