We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential, while the wife argues it's essential like her birth control.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is trying to manage finances and cut costs, so they categorized the acne medication as non-essential. The wife argues that since birth control is essential, her acne medication should be too. She also mentions that she'd be in pain without it and that it's unfair to make her use her discretionary budget.\n\nI should consider the definitions of \"essential\" here. Birth control is typically considered essential for family planning and health, so that's a given. Acne medication might be seen as more of a personal care or elective expense unless it's prescribed for medical reasons. However, if the acne is causing her physical or emotional distress, it might be viewed differently.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid an unintended pregnancy, which is a clear necessity. The wife's point is that her acne medication is as important for her well-being. There's a conflict here between financial management and individual health needs.\n\nI need to think about whether the author is dismissing a valid health need. If the acne medication is a medical necessity prescribed by a doctor, then it's essential. If it's over-the-counter, maybe not. The wife's mention of pain suggests it's more than just cosmetic, indicating a medical necessity. The author's stance might be seen as not acknowledging her health needs, making him the asshole.\n\nBut maybe the author is trying to prioritize expenses and the medication isn't as critical as birth control. However, if the wife is in pain without it, that's a health issue. The key here is whether the medication is truly necessary for her health. If it's a prescribed treatment for a medical condition, it's essential. If not, maybe not. The author's answer hinges on that distinction. Since the wife is insisting it's essential, the author might not have considered the medical necessity angle. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong by not recognizing her health needs as essential.\n"
