I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether acne medication should be considered a necessity in their budget.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is categorizing his wife's acne medication as non-essential, directing her to use her non-essential budget for it. The wife argues that since her birth control is essential (to prevent pregnancy), her acne medication should also be considered essential. She mentions she'll be in pain without it and feels it's unfair to use her non-essential funds.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: 1) Is acne medication a necessary expense? 2) How does it compare to other medications like birth control? 3) The fairness of splitting costs.\n\nMedically, acne can cause significant emotional and psychological distress. If left untreated, it might lead to scarring or affect self-esteem. So, some might argue it's a necessary medical expense. On the other hand, birth control is also essential for preventing pregnancy, which has financial and life implications. The husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to avoid an unplanned child, which is a valid point. However, equating that to acne medication's necessity might be where the conflict lies.\n\nThe wife is using her non-essential budget, which she feels is unfair. If the husband is making her pay from that budget, but he's calling the medication non-essential, there's a contradiction. If the medication is truly essential, then it should be covered under necessary expenses, not the discretionary part.\n\nAnother angle: the husband might be prioritizing costs, thinking that birth control is more essential. But the wife isn't arguing about the necessity of birth control but her own medication. The husband's stance seems dismissive of her health needs, possibly not recognizing the medical importance of the acne treatment.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they could discuss adjusting the budget to cover both essentials, or if there's a way to reallocate funds. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's refusing to acknowledge her medication as necessary, that could be seen as inconsiderate or not taking her health concerns seriously. Especially since she mentioned pain, which is a strong indicator that it's more than cosmetic.\n\nIn some contexts, medications for chronic conditions or those affecting quality of life are considered essential. Acne, depending on severity, might fall into that category. The husband's refusal to categorize it as such might be the issue. The wife's argument that if birth control is essential, so is her medication, suggests she's trying to draw a parallel that the husband isn't respecting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband might be in the wrong for not recognizing the necessity of her acne medication, especially if it's impacting her well-being. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
