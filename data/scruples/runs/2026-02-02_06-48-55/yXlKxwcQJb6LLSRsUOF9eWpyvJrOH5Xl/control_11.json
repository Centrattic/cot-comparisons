We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as non-essential. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is budgeting and trying to identify necessary vs. non-necessary expenses. The wife wants her acne medication listed as essential, while the husband disagrees, comparing it to her birth control. She argues that without the medication, she'll be in pain and that it's important, similar to birth control.\n\nHmm, birth control is typically considered essential because it's a medical necessity, both for preventing pregnancy and managing health issues. Acne medication might be seen as a treatment for a condition that affects self-esteem and mental health. Acne can cause emotional distress, so some might argue it's essential too. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that birth control is essential to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, which makes sense. But he's treating acne medication as non-essential, which the wife disagrees with. She's saying she'll be in pain without it, which could imply it's medically necessary for her. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. Financially, if they're overspending, prioritizing essentials is practical. But if the acne medication is part of her healthcare, maybe it's essential. Also, the fairness aspect\u2014she's using her own budget, but if the medication is essential, she shouldn't have to pay for it from non-essentials.\n\nIt's possible that the husband is not in the wrong if they're categorizing based on immediate health necessity vs. quality of life. But if acne treatment is part of her overall health and well-being, then maybe he is wrong. Also, the wife's pain might be a sign of a more serious issue, making the medication necessary.\n\nI think the key here is whether acne medication is considered a medical necessity. If it's prescribed by a doctor and necessary for her health, then the husband might be in the wrong. If it's more for cosmetic reasons, maybe not. But the wife's argument that it's important for her and causes pain if not used could tip it in her favor. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's dismissing her medical need.\n"
