We were making a list of all our necessary expenses that we absolutely can't cut, and my wife told me to add her acne medication. I told her that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that. She pointed out that her birth control is an essential, so her acne medication should be too. I told her birth control is essential so we don't end up with a kid. She told me she will be in pain (??) without her medication and we should both pay, and it's not fair that she has to use her monthly budget to pay for something that is so important for her. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering their wife's acne medication as a non-essential expense. The situation involves financial planning where they're trying to cut costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments from both sides. The author thinks acne meds are non-essential, while the wife argues they're as essential as her birth control. The wife mentions she'll be in pain without them. The author justifies birth control as essential because it prevents kids, which is a financial consideration, but sees acne meds as optional.\n\nSo, the key points here are: What's considered essential? Is mental health and physical discomfort from acne something that should be prioritized? Also, the wife is saying it's important for her well-being, which could be a medical necessity. Birth control is often considered essential for family planning, but acne meds can also be medically necessary, especially if they're prescribed by a doctor. \n\nThe author is splitting hairs between two medical necessities. If the acne medication is prescribed, it might be covered under insurance or considered a necessary health expense. The wife's argument that she's in pain without it suggests it's more than just a cosmetic issue. The author's stance might be dismissive of her health needs, which could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fairness aspect: the wife is saying it's not fair for her to have to use her personal budget for something essential. If they're sharing finances, maybe they should split the cost or include it in necessary expenses. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her health needs, which is a key part of a partnership. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing the acne medication as an essential expense. It's not just about the money but also about health and well-being. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
