My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially since she's handling most of the baby's care alone.\n\nThe author mentions they've been arguing about this for a couple of years. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive, like saying he'll hang out if they find something to do. After the baby was born, the author is even more upset because she's taking care of the baby all day, and when she's struggling, he goes to play games. A specific incident happened where the baby puked, and the author had to clean up alone while he was gaming. She told him she was done arguing and would leave if he kept doing this. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe his schedule is packed, but he's still part of a couple with a newborn. The author is on maternity leave, which might mean she's home all day with the baby and not working, so she's handling most of the childcare. The boyfriend's gaming habits are causing conflict because he's not helping, and the author feels ignored.\n\nThe key points are: the author has been expressing her concerns for years, the boyfriend agreed to change his behavior after a previous argument, but then he didn't follow through in a specific incident. The author then sets a firm boundary, saying she'll leave if he continues. \n\nThe boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but the author is standing by her boundary. The question is whether she's being unreasonable. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's been trying to communicate her feelings and needs, but the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. The fact that he agreed to stop playing in the presence of the baby but then did it anyway suggests he didn't take her seriously. The author is taking a stand to protect her own well-being, which is valid when there's a lack of respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel stressed from school and using gaming as a coping mechanism. However, when there's a newborn, both parents should be sharing responsibilities. If the author is doing all the work and the boyfriend isn't contributing, that's a problem. The specific incident where the baby puked and the author was alone shows a lack of support from him.\n\nIt's important to note that the author did give him multiple chances and communicated clearly. When someone ignores agreed-upon boundaries and continues harmful behavior, the affected person has the right to set consequences. The author's decision to leave is a response to ongoing disrespect, not a sudden decision without prior communication.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't the asshole. She's standing up for herself in a situation where her needs are not being met, and her partner isn't respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend's actions show a lack of consideration and respect, making the author's response justified.\n"
