My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, which the author feels is neglecting their responsibilities and her emotional needs.\n\nThe author has been expressing her concerns for years, and even after a recent agreement, the boyfriend continued gaming while the baby was crying. The author then tells him she'll leave if he doesn't stop. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend is in school and might be stressed, using games to unwind. However, he's also a parent, and his responsibilities include helping with the baby. The author is handling everything alone, which is a significant burden. The key points are communication, respect, and shared responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend agreed to the previous discussion but didn't follow through. The author set a boundary and then followed through when it was breached. The user's stance is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's fair. The author's actions stem from frustration and a need for support, which is valid. The boyfriend's response to her valid concerns by ignoring them shows a lack of respect. \n\nIn relationships, especially with shared responsibilities like parenting, communication and compromise are crucial. If one partner consistently disregards the other's feelings and needs, it can be a red flag. The author's decision to walk away after setting a clear boundary might be justified, as staying in a relationship where one's needs aren't respected can be harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
