My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The author is the girlfriend, and her boyfriend is in school full-time. She's on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much, especially when he prioritizes gaming over being present for her and the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ongoing issue with video games. The author feels like she's taking a backseat to his gaming. The boyfriend agreed to cut back after she confronted him, but then he went ahead and played for 40 minutes while the baby was up and needed attention. The baby puked, she had to clean the mess, and he was unresponsive during that time. She told him she's leaving if he does it again, and now he thinks she's picking a fight. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has been clearly upset about his gaming habits for a while. She's been trying to communicate her feelings, even setting boundaries. The boyfriend agreed to change, but then didn't follow through. His actions after the agreement show a lack of consideration for her needs and the baby's. The incident where he left to play while the baby was crying seems to be the breaking point for the author.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of playing games when the baby is awake and needing care is problematic. Even if gaming is a stress relief for him, the immediate needs of a newborn should take priority. The fact that he didn't respond to the baby's crying and was engrossed in his game is concerning. The author has a right to be upset because she's handling the baby alone, and his lack of action adds to her stress.\n\nShe's setting a boundary now, saying she's done arguing and will leave if he continues. That's her choice, and if he wasn't respecting her boundaries before, her decision to end the relationship is a valid response. He's dismissing her feelings by thinking she's picking a fight, which shows he's not listening to her valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that he's dealing with school and stress, using games to unwind. But since the baby is their child, both parents should share responsibilities. His actions show he's not contributing equally, which is a valid reason for her frustration.\n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. She communicated her needs, gave him chances to adjust, and now he's not following through despite the agreement. Her decision to leave is a consequence of his continued disregard for her and the baby's needs. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
