My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a couple with a young child and a conflict over video game time. The author is a woman on maternity leave taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone. Her boyfriend plays video games for hours while she's handling all the baby duties.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend is in school full-time, she's on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming for years. After he agreed to change, he still played during a critical time when the baby needed care. She told him she was done and would leave if he didn't stop. He doesn't get why she's upset, and she's calling him out for not respecting her.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to assess. Is she justified in setting boundaries? She's clearly stressed from managing the baby alone and has communicated her feelings multiple times. His actions disregard her previous warnings, showing a lack of consideration. Her ultimatum seems like a last resort after repeated issues. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when one partner consistently ignores the needs and boundaries of the other, especially in a situation involving childcare, it's a red flag. The boyfriend's behavior indicates he might not be taking her feelings seriously, which can strain the relationship. The author is standing up for herself, which is healthy, but the ultimatum might come off as harsh. However, given the context of ongoing issues and the stress of caring for a newborn, her actions are understandable. \n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The options are A (she is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering the boyfriend's lack of response to her concerns and the necessity of mutual respect in a relationship, the author's stance seems justified. She's trying to communicate her needs, and if he's not meeting them despite clear warnings, it's reasonable for her to take a firm stance. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
