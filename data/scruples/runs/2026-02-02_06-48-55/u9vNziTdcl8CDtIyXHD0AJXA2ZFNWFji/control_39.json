My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a new mom, taking care of a four-month-old daughter alone while her boyfriend is in school full-time. They've been arguing for a couple of years about him playing video games too much. He's been prioritizing gaming over spending time with her, and now with the baby, it's even more frustrating. The breaking point comes when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to a mess and her having to clean up alone. She tells him she'll leave if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. New parents often face challenges balancing responsibilities. She's handling the baby alone all day, which is exhausting and stressful. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe his schedule is tight, but he's still not helping when he's home. The fact that they've been having these arguments for years suggests a pattern of behavior. He agreed not to play when she brought it up less than a week ago, yet he does it again. That seems like he's not respecting her feelings or the agreement they made.\n\nShe's at her breaking point, and she's given him multiple chances. The specific incident where the baby pukes on her and the baby while he's away playing games is a clear example of him not stepping up when needed. Her reaction\u2014telling him she's done and will leave if it happens again\u2014might seem extreme, but considering the ongoing issue and the stress of parenting alone, it's her way of setting a boundary.\n\nHe thinks she's picking a fight, but she's explaining that she's been consistent and clear. It's possible he doesn't see the issue the same way, but her perspective is valid given the circumstances. Relationships require mutual respect and effort. If he's not making changes despite her communication, her decision to leave could be seen as self-respect rather than being the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself and her needs after repeated issues, which is reasonable. The boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, and she's setting a boundary.\n"
