My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games too much, especially after the baby was born. The author feels like she's taking the back seat to his gaming, and he's given her a dismissive response before. \n\nThe key incident happened when the baby was hungry, and he left to play a game for 40 minutes while the author had to handle the baby alone, leading to the baby puking and crying. The author told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. Now, she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly stressed and overwhelmed with caring for the baby alone. The boyfriend's gaming habit seems to be a recurring issue that's causing her distress. He agreed before that he was wrong, but then repeated the behavior. The author's breaking point came after this recent incident where he ignored her previous warning. She's threatening to leave, which is a big move, but maybe she feels it's necessary for her mental health and the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's in school and needs some downtime. But the fact that he agreed to change before and then didn't follow through suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings. The author is in a vulnerable position being on maternity leave, which is a stressful time, and she's not getting support. Her decision to leave might be seen as self-respect, but some might argue that threatening to leave over this is too drastic.\n\nHowever, given the context\u2014repeated issues, the baby's needs, and the boyfriend's failure to act on his prior agreement\u2014it seems like the author is justified in feeling neglected. Her actions are a response to consistent behavior that's harming the relationship. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The boyfriend's actions are the root problem here. The author is taking a stand for herself and her child, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
