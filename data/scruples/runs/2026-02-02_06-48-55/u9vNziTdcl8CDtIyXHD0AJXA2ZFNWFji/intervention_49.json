My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author is upset about, especially since they have a newborn. He's in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby care. There's been a history of arguments about his gaming. The key incident is when the baby pukes after eating, and the boyfriend leaves to play a game for 40 minutes, ignoring the crying baby. The author confronts him, he doesn't understand why she's upset, and she threatens to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both partners. Since the boyfriend is in school, maybe he's not working, but he's still part of the parenting role. The author is handling all the baby care alone, which is a lot. The boyfriend's actions of leaving to play when the baby is crying seems neglectful, especially after he had previously agreed to change his behavior. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of not understanding why she's upset might indicate a lack of empathy or communication issues. The author's threat to leave if he doesn't stop is a strong move, but is it justified? The question is whether she's being unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might have some responsibility. The boyfriend didn't act in a supportive way, but the author's threat to leave could be seen as a last resort after repeated issues. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the boyfriend's actions are more to blame. \n\nLooking at the situation, the author has valid reasons to be upset. The boyfriend's behavior isn't respecting her needs and the baby's needs. The author isn't the asshole here because she's trying to communicate and set boundaries. The boyfriend's inconsiderate actions are the main issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
