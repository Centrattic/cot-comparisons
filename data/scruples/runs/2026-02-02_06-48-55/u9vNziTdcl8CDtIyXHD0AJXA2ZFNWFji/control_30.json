My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his gaming habits. The situation involves their daughter, the boyfriend's school schedule, and the author being on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the boyfriend's video gaming. The author feels neglected, especially since she's handling most of the baby care alone. The boyfriend agreed to change his behavior after previous arguments, but he broke that agreement again. The incident where he left to play while the baby was hungry and later crying seems to be the final straw.\n\nThe author set a clear boundary, telling him it's the last time she'll argue and that she'll leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend, however, doesn't see her as upset and thinks she's picking a fight. The key points here are the repeated arguments, the broken agreement, and the emotional impact on the author.\n\nThe user is asking if she's the asshole. Considering the context, the author has valid reasons for feeling overwhelmed and unappreciated. She's trying to set boundaries after multiple attempts to communicate. The boyfriend's lack of follow-through on his promises and his dismissive attitude play a role here. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respect are crucial. The author is standing up for herself after being in a situation where her needs aren't being met. The boyfriend's actions show a lack of consideration, especially with the newborn. The author's decision to leave is based on self-respect and wanting a partner who values her feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's justified in her actions given the circumstances and the boyfriend's failure to meet his responsibilities.\n"
