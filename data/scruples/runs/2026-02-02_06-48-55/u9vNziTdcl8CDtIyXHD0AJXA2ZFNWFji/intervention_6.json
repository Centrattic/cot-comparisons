My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend plays a lot of video games. The author is the girlfriend, and she's upset because he's playing games while she's handling the baby alone. She told him to stop or she'd leave him, and now he's saying she's picking a fight. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The boyfriend is in school full-time, the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The main issue is the boyfriend's gaming habits. The author has been arguing about this for a couple of years, feeling like the games come before her. After the baby was born, her frustration increased. She told him two weeks ago that playing while the baby sleeps is okay but not when she's up. Then, the incident happened where he left to play while the baby needed attention, leading to her being upset and threatening to leave.\n\nNow, why might the author be in the right? She's under a lot of stress with the baby and feels unsupported. She's communicated her feelings multiple times, and he didn't change his behavior even after agreeing to her concerns. The situation seems to be a pattern of neglect, especially with a newborn. She's setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The final incident was a breaking point after repeated issues.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overreacting? The boyfriend might not realize the gravity of his actions. He was playing a game for 40 minutes after she agreed to the previous terms. However, the author did communicate her boundaries clearly, and he still didn't respect them. The fact that he didn't understand her upset could indicate a lack of empathy or communication issues. But does that make her the asshole? She's standing up for herself and her needs, which is important in a healthy relationship. Threatening to leave when there's a pattern of neglect isn't unreasonable. Relationships require mutual respect and effort, and if one person isn't meeting the other's needs despite clear communication, it's valid to walk away.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing legitimate concerns and setting a boundary after repeated failures. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight might be because he doesn't see his actions as problematic, but her perspective is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
