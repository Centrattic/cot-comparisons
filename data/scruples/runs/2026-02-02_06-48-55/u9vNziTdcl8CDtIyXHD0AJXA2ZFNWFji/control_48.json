My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too much video games, especially after they have a newborn and she's on maternity leave. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author feels neglected.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has a four-month-old, so the mom is dealing with a lot of stress and responsibilities. The boyfriend plays video games for long hours, which she finds frustrating. They've had arguments before, and even after he agreed to change, he still played during a time when she needed help with the baby. She told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has tried to communicate her feelings multiple times, including a recent agreement that he didn't follow. She's in a vulnerable position with a newborn, and the lack of support from her partner is causing her stress. Her ultimatum is a response to his repeated behavior despite her clear boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he doesn't see the issue, which could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. However, setting boundaries in a relationship is important, especially when one partner's actions are affecting the other's well-being. The author is prioritizing her own mental health and the health of the relationship by standing up for herself.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many would support the author's right to set boundaries. However, some might argue that threatening to leave is extreme. But given the context of a newborn and prior communication attempts, her actions seem justified. The boyfriend's failure to respect her feelings and the situation with the baby is a significant factor. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her needs and the relationship's health. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
