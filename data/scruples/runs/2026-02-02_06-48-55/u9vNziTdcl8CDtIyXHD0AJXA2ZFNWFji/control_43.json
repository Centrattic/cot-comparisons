My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend playing video games excessively while they're taking care of their newborn. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming, and after a specific incident where the baby puked and the boyfriend was playing, the author told him she'd leave if he didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's defense is that he's in school, and maybe his gaming is a way to unwind. However, the author is handling all the baby duties alone, which can be overwhelming. The key points here are communication and respect. The author had already set a boundary five days prior, and the boyfriend ignored it. The incident where he left during the baby's feeding and played through the mess and crying seems particularly egregious. \n\nThe author's response was to state her last warning, which could be seen as justified if the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, maybe the boyfriend felt he needed some downtime, but with a newborn, both parents should share responsibilities. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to prioritize her well-being and the baby's needs over his gaming. \n\nConsidering the context of a new parent's stress and the boyfriend not following through on agreed-upon boundaries, the author's decision to walk away might be reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of understanding and continued behavior despite prior warnings suggests he might not be respecting her feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
