My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially since she's on maternity leave and handling most of the baby's needs alone.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, so he's balancing studies and being a new parent. The author is dealing with the baby alone, which is a huge responsibility. The key incident is when he leaves to play a game for 40 minutes while the baby is under her care, leading to the baby puking and crying. She confronts him, but he doesn't understand her upset, and she threatens to leave him if he continues this behavior.\n\nThe author has already discussed this with him before, and he agreed to change. But he didn't follow through. She's saying that after this incident, she told him she's done and will leave if he does it again. The question is whether she's in the wrong here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's exhausted, handling the baby alone, and he's not supporting her as a partner. She's communicated her boundaries clearly, but he didn't respect them. His actions are neglectful, and she's standing up for herself. On the other hand, maybe she could have handled it differently, like setting clearer expectations or working with him to find a solution. But given the context, she's at her breaking point. The baby's needs are paramount, and the boyfriend's lack of responsiveness is a problem. The author isn't just being irrational; she's reacting to repeated neglect. So, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
