My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she'll leave him if he doesn't stop playing video games. They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the woman mentions they've been arguing about his gaming frequency for a couple of years. She feels she's taking a backseat to his games. He told her he'd play if she couldn't find something for them to do. After the baby was born, she's more upset because she's handling everything alone, and he comes home and plays for hours. \n\nThe specific incident was him leaving to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating, leading to the baby puking and her having to clean up alone. She told him she's done arguing and will leave if it happens again. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she argues he's not respecting her after agreeing earlier to cut down.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. To determine this, I need to assess if her reaction is justified. She's clearly stressed from taking care of the baby alone and has communicated her boundaries before. He broke those boundaries again, and she's holding him accountable. Her ultimatum is a last straw after repeated issues. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems dismissive. He agreed to her concerns but then went ahead and ignored them, possibly not taking her seriously. The woman is trying to prioritize her mental health and the relationship's well-being by setting a firm boundary. \n\nIs her response reasonable? She's not just being petty; she's addressing a recurring problem that affects her daily life and the child's care. Her decision to leave if he doesn't change is a consequence she's communicated, and he's not respecting that. \n\nSo in this case, the woman isn't the asshole. She's standing up for herself after being patient and trying to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not hers. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
