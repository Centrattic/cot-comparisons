My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming for years. She feels neglected, and after the baby's birth, it's gotten worse. The recent incident involved the baby puking while he was playing, and she had to handle it alone. She confronts him, he doesn't seem to get why she's upset, and she threatens to leave.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From her perspective, she's handling all the baby duties alone, and he's not being supportive. She's tried to communicate her feelings, and he's not changing his behavior. The fact that he agreed to stop gaming during the baby's sleep but then still plays when she's struggling shows a lack of consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's stressed from school and using games as an escape. But the key here is that she's the primary caregiver right now. His actions are impacting her ability to cope with their new baby. The incident where he leaves to play while the baby is hungry and then she has to deal with the mess alone is a significant stressor. \n\nThreatening to leave is a big step, but given the context of ongoing issues and the recent incident, it might be her way of setting a boundary. She's saying she can't continue in a relationship where her needs and the baby's needs aren't prioritized. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a tough call. She's justified in feeling upset and frustrated. However, threatening to leave after one incident might be seen as overreacting, especially if he's under his own stress. But given the history and the recent event, it's more about a pattern of neglect. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She's communicating her needs and setting boundaries, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior is the main issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
