My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post. She's a woman with a 4-month-old daughter, her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which she feels is prioritized over her and their baby.\n\nShe mentions that they've been arguing about this for a couple of years. He used to say things like, \"If you can find something for us to do, then I'll hang out with you,\" implying that she's the one responsible for coming up with activities. Since the baby was born, she's been taking care of the baby alone all day, and he comes home and plays games. She confronted him a week ago, and he agreed to stop. But today, he went to play a 40-minute game right after the baby was fed, leading to a mess, and she felt ignored. She told him she's done and would leave if it happens again. He thinks she's picking a fight, and she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author (herself) is in the wrong. Her initial thought is that she is, but she's uncertain. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The boyfriend's gaming is causing conflict. The author feels neglected, especially with the baby. She's been trying to address it for a while. He agreed to change his behavior a week before the incident. The specific incident was him playing during a time when the baby needed attention, leading to a mess and emotional distress for the author. She then tells him she'll leave if he doesn't stop, which he perceives as her being confrontational.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she's given him feedback multiple times. He agreed to change, but didn't follow through. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014she's handling the baby alone, which is exhausting, and his gaming during that time makes her feel unsupported. The threat of leaving is a significant step, but it's a reaction to accumulated stress and unmet needs.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If one partner's behavior is consistently causing harm or neglect to the other's needs, it's reasonable to seek change. However, using a threat to end the relationship in response to one incident might be seen as extreme. But considering the context\u2014ongoing issues, prior agreement to change, and the emotional toll\u2014her actions could be seen as a last resort after repeated failures to address the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's being unfairly criticized, especially if he's in school and needs downtime. However, his actions after agreeing to change could show a lack of respect for her concerns. The key points are communication, prior agreements, and the impact on the baby's care.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parental support and shared responsibilities are important. If one parent is shouldering all the childcare duties while the other is disengaged, that's a problem. The author's frustration is valid. Her response, while drastic, might be justified given the circumstances and the lack of change from him.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of an ultimatum, seeking couples counseling or more collaborative problem-solving could be better. However, after multiple attempts and no improvement, leaving might be a reasonable choice. The question is whether her actions are a justified response to his ongoing neglect.\n\nSo considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and her needs after repeated issues. Answer B.\n"
