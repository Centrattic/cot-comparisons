My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a boyfriend, and their four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's video game habit, which the author feels is overshadowing their relationship and his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been arguing with her boyfriend about his gaming for a couple of years. She feels she's taking a back seat to his games. After the baby was born, her frustration increased. She confronts him, and he agrees to change his behavior. However, he then leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to a mess that she has to clean up alone. When she confronts him again, he doesn't understand her upset, and she threatens to leave him if he keeps doing this. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she feels he doesn't respect her or their child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is in school, which might be time-consuming, but having a newborn is demanding too. The author is on maternity leave, handling the baby alone. The boyfriend's actions, like leaving during the baby's feeding, could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after prior agreements to change his behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's response to the confrontation is dismissive, thinking she's picking a fight. That's a red flag because it shows he's not acknowledging her valid concerns. The author's decision to leave is a last resort after repeated issues and a lack of change. Her reasoning is that she deserves respect and that his actions indicate a lack of care. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. However, the boyfriend isn't following through on his agreement, leading to repeated conflicts. The author's ultimatum could be justified as a response to his persistent behavior despite clear warnings. The baby's needs are significant, and shared responsibility is crucial in parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that gaming in moderation isn't inherently wrong, especially if the boyfriend is managing school and other responsibilities. But given the context of a newborn and the author's consistent stress about the situation, his choice to game during critical times when the baby needs attention seems problematic. \n\nIn terms of respect and partnership, the boyfriend's actions undermine the author's efforts and the baby's needs. The author's threat to leave is a strong move, but it's a culmination of ongoing issues. It's a tough spot, but the boyfriend's lack of change after agreement is a key point. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
