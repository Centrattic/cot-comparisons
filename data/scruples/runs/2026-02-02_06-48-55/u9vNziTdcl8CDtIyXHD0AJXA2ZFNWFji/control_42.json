My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend (27M) who plays a lot of video games, which the author (his girlfriend) feels is making her take the back seat, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The author is on maternity leave, handling the baby while he's in school. The key points here are the communication issues, the boyfriend's lack of response to previous warnings, and the author's ultimatum about leaving.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend agreed to the author's concerns less than a week ago but then immediately repeated the same behavior, playing a 40-minute game while the baby was needing attention. The author felt that despite agreeing to change, he didn't follow through, leading to her frustration. She told him it's the last time she's arguing and that she'll leave if it happens again. Now the question is whether she's in the wrong for taking that stance.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The boyfriend's behavior, especially after agreeing to change, might be the main issue here. The author is trying to set boundaries for her well-being and their relationship's health. If the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, then the author is within her rights to take such a strong stance. The fact that the baby needs care and the author is handling it alone adds weight to the situation. The boyfriend's lack of response to her previous warnings might indicate a pattern of disregard for her feelings, which the author is now addressing firmly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's being too harsh, but given the circumstances and the repeated behavior after a clear agreement, her reaction seems reasonable. The key is whether the boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate and if the author's response was a necessary step to protect her own mental and emotional health. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
