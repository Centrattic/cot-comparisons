My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, leading to arguments, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter. The author is on maternity leave, handling all the baby care alone, and the boyfriend is in school. The key incident is when the boyfriend leaves to play a game while the baby is up, leading to a mess and frustration. The author then tells him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop, which he doesn't understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend was informed previously about the issue and even agreed to change his behavior. Then he repeats the behavior, leading to the author feeling disrespected. The author's actions are a response to ongoing stress and lack of support. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he doesn't see the problem, which might indicate a lack of empathy or communication.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But why? Maybe because threatening to leave over this issue is too harsh? Or perhaps because the boyfriend's actions weren't malicious. However, the author is in a vulnerable position with a newborn, and the boyfriend's actions contribute to her stress without contributing to childcare. The boyfriend's response of not understanding her anger could be a red flag for not valuing her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried more communication or compromise before threatening to leave. But given the context of repeated issues and the stress of parenting alone, her reaction might be justified. The question is whether her response was appropriate. The boyfriend's behavior shows a pattern, and the author feels it's beyond her capacity to handle alone.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. Her actions are a result of accumulated stress and the boyfriend's failure to meet her needs. The boyfriend's lack of understanding and continued behavior could make him more at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (not the author's fault).\n"
