My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially after the baby's birth. The key points are the boyfriend's gaming habits, the recent incident where he left to play during the baby's feeding time, leading to her puking and the author having to handle everything alone. The author then tells the boyfriend she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The author is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby's care, while the boyfriend is in school full-time. The boyfriend has been told before that his gaming is causing issues, and he agreed to change. However, he repeats the behavior, leading to the author's ultimatum.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the boyfriend doesn't care or respect her, so she's ending the relationship. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider communication and expectations. The boyfriend was warned about his behavior, and he didn't follow through. The author has legitimate reasons for feeling overwhelmed and neglected. The ultimatum might be extreme, but given the circumstances\u2014caring for a newborn alone, repeated issues\u2014it's a significant stressor. The boyfriend's actions during the baby's feeding time were inconsiderate, contributing to the author's frustration. \n\nHowever, the author's response is to threaten leaving. Is that reasonable? Maybe, but it's a big step. But considering the context\u2014long-standing issues, recent incident, and emotional toll\u2014it might be seen as a justified decision if the boyfriend is not willing to make changes. The boyfriend's inaction after agreement shows a lack of respect, according to the author. So the author isn't wrong in feeling that way. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's actions are indeed neglecting the author's needs and the child's care, then the author isn't the asshole. She's standing up for herself. However, some might argue that threatening to leave after one incident is harsh, but given the history, it's cumulative. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for her actions, given the boyfriend's repeated disregard for her feelings and the baby's needs.\n"
