My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is a couple with a new baby, and the boyfriend is playing a lot of video games, which the author is upset about. The key points here are communication, shared responsibilities, and boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions that they've been arguing about the gaming frequency for a couple of years. The boyfriend is in school, and the author is on maternity leave. After the baby was born, the author's frustration increased because they feel they're handling everything alone. The boyfriend agreed that the gaming was inappropriate after a previous argument. However, he still plays during a time when the baby is in need, leading to a mess that the author has to handle alone. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend claims he's trying to help by playing during the baby's sleep, but the author had clearly set boundaries. The situation where he left to play during feeding time and didn't take responsibility shows a lack of responsiveness to the author's needs. The author's frustration is valid because they're dealing with a new baby without support. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive of her feelings, even after agreeing to change.\n\nThe author is standing up for themselves and stating that their boundaries aren't being respected. Threatening to leave is a strong move, but it's in response to repeated dismissiveness. The boyfriend's lack of understanding and the author's need for support make the situation more about the boyfriend not meeting the relationship's needs. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they're asserting their needs after being ignored.\n"
