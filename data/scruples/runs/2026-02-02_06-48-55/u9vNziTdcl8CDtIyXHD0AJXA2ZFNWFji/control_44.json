My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the scenario is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the woman is upset because he's prioritizing games over helping with the baby. She told him she'd leave if he doesn't stop, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. She's handling all the baby duties alone. He agreed to cut back on gaming after she confronted him before, but then he went ahead and played when the baby needed her attention. The woman is frustrated and feels disrespected. She told him she's done after this incident and threatened to leave.\n\nThe key points here are: she's taking care of the baby alone, he agreed to change his behavior but didn't, and she's setting a boundary. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary. \n\nOn one hand, she's standing up for herself and her feelings, which is important in a relationship. She's not okay with being neglected and is taking a stand. On the other hand, some might argue that she's being too harsh or reacting too quickly by threatening to leave. But considering the context\u2014caring for a newborn, previous arguments, and his lack of follow-through\u2014it seems like she's at her breaking point.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (playing during a critical time when the baby was up and needed attention) probably hurt her deeply. She's not just making a fight; she's addressing a pattern of behavior that's been ongoing. He dismissed her feelings, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. She's trying to communicate her needs and set boundaries. The boyfriend's refusal to respect her previous agreement and his lack of awareness of her frustration make him the one at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
