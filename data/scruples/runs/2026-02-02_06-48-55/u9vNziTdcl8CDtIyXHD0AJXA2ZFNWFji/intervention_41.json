My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too much video games. \n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. The author feels neglected and that he prioritizes games over her and their baby. The recent incident involved the baby spilling on her and needing attention, but the boyfriend was gaming instead. The author told him she's done and will leave if he does it again.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication, priorities, and the impact of the boyfriend's actions on their family. The boyfriend's gaming is interfering with his responsibilities, especially since they have a newborn. The author is the one taking care of the baby alone, which is a significant burden. The boyfriend agreed to the problem before, then repeated the same behavior.\n\nThe author's response was to set a clear boundary: if he doesn't change, she leaves. The boyfriend, however, doesn't see her anger as a fight but as overreaction. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when there's a fundamental disagreement about priorities, especially in a situation involving parenting responsibilities, communication is crucial. The boyfriend's actions might not be malicious, but they're affecting the author's well-being and the baby's care. The author's decision to set a boundary might be a justified step to protect her mental health and ensure her needs are met.\n\nHowever, some might argue that threatening to leave after one incident could be seen as extreme, especially if there's a chance for mutual understanding and adjustment. But given the repeated issues and the critical nature of parental responsibilities, the author's stance might be reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of follow-through after agreeing to change could indicate a pattern of not respecting her boundaries, which is a valid concern.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs in a situation where her partner isn't meeting them despite prior discussions. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
