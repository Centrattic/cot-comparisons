My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend, who is in school full-time, plays a lot of video games, which the author feels undermines their relationship and her responsibilities. The key events are that after discussing the issue, the boyfriend still plays games while the author is handling baby duties alone. The author then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is on maternity leave, so she's managing all the baby's needs, which can be exhausting. The boyfriend is in school, so his schedule might be demanding. The issue is that he's prioritizing gaming over being present, even after agreeing to change his behavior. The author feels disrespected and overwhelmed.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: He left to play a 40-minute game while the baby needed attention. The baby puked, leading to the author having to clean up, and then the baby cried while he was playing nearby. She expressed her upset, but he didn't acknowledge it until the game was over. He then didn't understand why she was upset, which suggests a lack of empathy or awareness.\n\nThe author's response was to tell him she's done and would leave if he doesn't change. The question is whether this is justified. From the author's perspective, she's been patient, discussed the issue, and now feels her needs and boundaries are not respected. Her frustration is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that he thinks she's picking a fight. However, the author had previously communicated her concerns, so his continued behavior indicates he's not respecting her boundaries. The author is standing up for herself, which is a valid response when one's needs are repeatedly overlooked, especially in a parenting context where teamwork is crucial.\n\nConsidering the balance of the situation, the author's actions are a culmination of ongoing issues and a final breaking point. Threatening to leave is a serious step, but given the circumstances, it's a response to repeated disrespect. The boyfriend's failure to meet his responsibilities in the relationship (both as a partner and a parent) might justify her decision. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
