My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've had ongoing issues with him playing video games excessively, leading to her feeling neglected. After he ignores her previous warnings and plays during a time when she's dealing with the baby's mess and needs help, she tells him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior: he's supposed to be sharing parenting responsibilities. When the baby is hungry and then pukes, he leaves to play for 40 minutes. That seems neglectful. The author had already set a boundary, and he crossed it again. His reaction is dismissing her feelings, thinking she's picking a fight. That's not respectful.\n\nThe author's response is to tell him she's done and will leave next time. It's her way of setting a boundary after repeated issues. She's under a lot of stress with the baby and no support. Her actions are a reaction to his lack of consideration and failure to respect previous agreements.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, he's the one not following through on shared responsibilities. She's trying to communicate her needs and set limits. Her ultimatum is a response to his continued disregard. While it's a tough situation, she's not the one being unreasonable. The boyfriend's lack of empathy and support is the main issue here. So, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
