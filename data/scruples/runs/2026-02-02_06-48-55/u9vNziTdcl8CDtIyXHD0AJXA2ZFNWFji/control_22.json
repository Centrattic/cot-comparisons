My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend, who is in school full-time, plays a lot of video games. The author, who is on maternity leave, is taking care of the baby alone and is frustrated because the boyfriend is prioritizing gaming over helping with the baby. \n\nThe key points here are the context of their responsibilities and the recent incident. The boyfriend was told earlier that playing games while the baby is awake is a problem. Then, when the baby needs attention, he leaves to play, leading to a messy situation. The author confronts him, and he doesn't understand her upset. She then tells him she's leaving if he does it again.\n\nFirst, consider the expectations in a relationship where both partners have responsibilities. The boyfriend is in school and works, but the author is handling the baby alone. After the baby's birth, this imbalance might be causing stress. The boyfriend's actions of leaving to play games when the baby is crying could be seen as neglecting shared responsibilities. \n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary, which is understandable given the stress. However, is threatening to leave over this issue the right approach? It depends on how the situation is framed. The author felt disrespected and unheeded after previous discussions. She's trying to communicate her needs, but the boyfriend isn't responsive. \n\nIs she wrong for setting a boundary? Maybe not. However, the question is whether she overreacted. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, but threatening to end the relationship over this specific incident might be seen as extreme. Relationships require compromise and communication. If the author is using this as a ultimatum without addressing the underlying issues, it could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut looking at the context: the baby is four months old, a critical time for bonding and shared care. The boyfriend's actions (leaving during the baby's needs) could harm the baby's well-being and the author's mental health. The author has already given warnings, and the boyfriend hasn't changed. Her frustration is valid. \n\nHowever, threatening to leave because he played a game once more might be too quick. The boyfriend might not realize the severity, but the author's response is a red flag if the issue is about respect and shared parenting. \n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's behavior is the primary issue. The author is trying to communicate her boundaries, which is not inconsiderate. However, whether she's wrong depends on the relationship's dynamics. Since the boyfriend isn't meeting his responsibilities, her stance is justified. Therefore, she's not the asshole.\n"
