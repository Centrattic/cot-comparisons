My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is his excessive video game playing, which the author feels is making her take the back seat, especially after the baby's birth.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says they've been arguing about this for a couple of years. He told her that if she can find activities for them to do together, he'll join her, otherwise he'll play games. That seems dismissive. After the baby was born, she's handling most of the care alone, and he's playing games instead of helping. Recently, even when the baby was eating, he left to play, leading to a mess and her having to deal with it alone. She confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. She then threatens to leave if he does it again.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective isn't fully explained, but he thinks she's picking a fight. He might feel that he can't help it or that he's under stress from school. But the key point here is that she's been clear about her boundaries. She told him five days ago that playing during the baby's nap is okay, but other times it's not. He still played when he shouldn't, showing a lack of respect for her feelings.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, juggling a new baby and not working, which can be isolating. The boyfriend's actions are contributing to her stress. She's set a boundary, and he crossed it again. Her decision to leave if he doesn't stop isn't just about the games but about being respected in the relationship. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. He's the one not respecting her boundaries. She's standing up for herself after repeated issues. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
