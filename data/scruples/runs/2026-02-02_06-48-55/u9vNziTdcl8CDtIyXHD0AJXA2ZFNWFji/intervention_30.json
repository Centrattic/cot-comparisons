My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games despite previous agreements.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming habits. The key point is that after he agreed to stop gaming during certain times, he broke that agreement again by leaving to play while the baby was crying. The author then tells him she's leaving if he continues this behavior.\n\nThe author argues that she's been clear about her expectations and that his actions show a lack of respect. The boyfriend, however, thinks she's overreacting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's handling all the baby's needs alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's gaming during critical times (like when the baby is crying) could be seen as neglecting his parental duties and her emotional needs. The fact that he agreed to change his behavior previously but didn't follow through might justify her frustration. Threatening to leave in the context of a relationship where communication and mutual respect are key could be a valid response if there's a pattern of disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend isn't intentionally malicious, just stressed from school and finds an escape in gaming. However, the author has valid reasons for feeling unsupported, especially with the added stress of a new baby. The immediate threat of leaving after a specific incident might be harsh, but considering the cumulative issues and his repeated behavior, it's a response to ongoing neglect.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. She's set a boundary that he's crossed multiple times, which is a legitimate reason to reassess the relationship. Her emotional response is tied to her feelings of being undervalued and overburdened. While the threat to leave could be seen as extreme, the context of persistent issues and the impact on their daughter's care might support her stance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs in a situation where her partner has consistently failed to meet agreed-upon responsibilities, especially in a high-stress time with a newborn.\n"
