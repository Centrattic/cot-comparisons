My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The author is on maternity leave and takes care of the baby, while the boyfriend is in school. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing video games too much, which the author feels is making her take a back seat in the relationship.\n\nThe key incident happened when the baby was hungry, took 10 minutes to eat, and the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked, and the author had to clean up alone. When he finished, she was upset, but he didn't understand why. The author then told him she's done and would leave if it happened again.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. \n\nFirst, consider the context: the author is handling all the baby's care alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's gaming habits have been an issue for a couple of years, and even after agreeing to change, he reverted. The author gave a clear warning five days prior, and he ignored it. The situation escalated to the point where she felt it's best to end the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend's actions in the specific incident were neglectful, especially given the prior agreement. The author's frustration is understandable, as she's handling the baby alone and feels unsupported. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that he left to play after the baby was feeding, assuming she was okay. But the author's perspective is that he's not prioritizing her and the baby's needs, which are critical now with a newborn. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If one partner consistently ignores the other's feelings and agreements, it's a sign of disrespect. The author's decision to set a final boundary and act on it isn't necessarily wrong, especially given the repeated issues. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs after repeated neglect and has made a final decision to protect her well-being and the baby's.\n"
