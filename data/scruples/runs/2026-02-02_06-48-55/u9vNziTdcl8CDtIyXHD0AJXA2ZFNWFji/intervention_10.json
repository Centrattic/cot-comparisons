My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend (now husband, I suppose) playing too much video games while they're taking care of their four-month-old daughter alone. The key points here are the context of their responsibilities, communication issues, and the escalation leading to the author threatening to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author is on maternity leave, handling the baby alone all day, and the boyfriend is in school full-time. The boyfriend has been playing games, which the author feels is prioritized over their relationship. They've had ongoing arguments about this, and even after the boyfriend agreed to change his behavior, he relapses by playing while the baby is in need. The author then confronts him, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's reaction is justified. On one hand, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglecting his partner and child, especially after agreeing to stop. The author has valid reasons for frustration given the workload and emotional strain. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's under stress from school and using games as a coping mechanism, not intending to be dismissive.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is a strong reaction. But considering the context\u2014ongoing issues, prior agreement to change, and the immediate incident where the baby was upset and the author felt unsupported\u2014maybe it's a reasonable response. The boyfriend's lack of understanding after being directly told about the boundary might indicate a lack of respect, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking couples' counseling or finding compromises. But given the stress and the repeated failure of the boyfriend to adjust, the author's frustration is understandable. The line between being assertive and being an asshole is thin here. The author's actions are a response to long-term neglect, so maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
