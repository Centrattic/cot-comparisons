My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. They've provided a detailed situation from a Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with a 27-year-old boyfriend who's in school full-time. They have a four-month-old daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is causing her to be neglected, especially since she's on maternity leave and handling most of the baby's care. The key incident happened when the baby was hungry, and the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked, and the author had to deal with the mess alone. She confronted him, but he didn't seem to understand her frustration. She then told him she'd leave if he didn't stop, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's assess the boyfriend's actions. He was told previously that his gaming was a problem, especially after the baby was born. He agreed, but then still left to play during a critical time when the baby needed him. The baby puked, and he wasn't there to help. That seems like a clear neglect of parental responsibility. The author has been handling everything alone, which is a lot for a new mother. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was dismissive; he didn't understand why she was upset. That shows a lack of empathy and not taking her concerns seriously. The author set a boundary and enforced it when he crossed it again. She's not just angry without cause; she's been trying to communicate and has been ignored. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be under a lot of stress with school and parenting. Maybe he's using games as a coping mechanism. But even so, when the baby is in immediate need, his absence is a problem. The author is in a vulnerable position, dealing with a newborn and the demands of maternity leave without support. \n\nThe author's decision to set a firm boundary and threaten to leave if things don't change is a response to ongoing neglect. She's not just lashing out without prior attempts to resolve the issue. The key points are communication, repeated issues, and the critical incident where the baby needed help. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the one in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author is standing up for herself and seeking respect and support in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
