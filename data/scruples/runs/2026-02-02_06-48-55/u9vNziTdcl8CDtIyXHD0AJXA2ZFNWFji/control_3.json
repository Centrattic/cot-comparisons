My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, especially since they have a newborn daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend continues to play video games despite previous agreements and the author's expressed frustration.\n\nFirst, consider the context. New parents often face challenges in balancing responsibilities. The author is handling the baby alone all day and comes home to the boyfriend playing games. The boyfriend's behavior hasn't changed even after being told it's upsetting. The last incident involved the baby puking, and the boyfriend left to play, leading to the author's outburst.\n\nThe author's actions: She told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight. The key points here are communication and respect. The boyfriend didn't heed her warnings, showing a lack of regard for her feelings. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is valid, especially when it's affecting her mental health and the baby's care.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she's communicating her needs and the consequences if they aren't met. It's not about being in the right or wrong but about mutual respect and effort. The boyfriend's inconsiderate actions are the root issue here. The author's ultimatum is a response to his lack of change, which is a reasonable step when other methods fail.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself and her needs, especially in a high-stress situation with a newborn. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here.\n"
