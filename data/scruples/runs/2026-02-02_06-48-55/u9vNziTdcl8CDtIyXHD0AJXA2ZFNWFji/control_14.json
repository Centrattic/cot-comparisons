My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, which the author finds frustrating, especially since they have a newborn daughter. The author has brought this up before, and even after the boyfriend agreed to change his behavior, he still played during a time when the baby was crying. Then the author threatened to leave him if he continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old. The author feels neglected and is handling the baby alone most of the time. The boyfriend's gaming is interfering with their responsibilities, particularly after the baby gets sick and he's still playing. The author set a boundary, the boyfriend crossed it, and then she threatened to leave.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From the description, the author is clearly communicating her feelings and boundaries. She's not just randomly angry; there's a pattern of behavior from the boyfriend that's been a problem for months. The situation escalated to a point where the baby was crying while he played, which is a critical moment in parenting. The author's frustration is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is dismissive, not understanding why she's upset. This shows a lack of empathy and willingness to address her concerns. The author's decision to set a firm boundary after multiple attempts seems reasonable. Threatening to leave because she feels disrespected is a personal choice, but given the context, it's not necessarily wrong. She's prioritizing her well-being and the child's needs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have tried another method before threatening to end the relationship, but the boyfriend didn't take her concerns seriously even after she clearly stated them. The fact that he didn't change his behavior despite prior warnings suggests he's not meeting his responsibilities as a partner and father. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. However, the author isn't at fault for standing up for herself and her needs, especially in a stressful time. The boyfriend is more at fault for not respecting her boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
