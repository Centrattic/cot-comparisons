My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after threatening to leave her boyfriend over his gaming habits. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe couple has a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, handling most of the childcare alone. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing video games too much. The author feels neglected and that he prioritizes games over being with her. After a specific incident where he left her alone during the baby's feeding, leading to a mess and crying, she told him she's had enough and would leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, while she argues that he's shown disregard for her feelings and his responsibilities as a parent. The key points here are the shared responsibilities in parenting, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author is clearly frustrated and overwhelmed. The boyfriend's actions (leaving during a feeding, playing for 40 minutes while the baby is crying) don't seem to show adequate support. However, the author's response was to threaten leaving, which is a significant decision. But considering the context\u2014she's on maternity leave, dealing with a newborn, and this is a recurring issue\u2014her frustration is understandable.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, expressing her feelings and setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. However, threatening to end the relationship over this might be extreme. But given the cumulative stress and the importance of mutual support in parenting, her stance might be justified. The boyfriend's lack of responsiveness to her previous warnings could indicate a pattern of neglect, which is a valid reason to reevaluate the relationship. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong (B), but I need to be careful about the nuances.\n"
