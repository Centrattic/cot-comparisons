My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn daughter. The boyfriend (27M) is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing video games too much, especially since the baby was born.\n\nThe author feels neglected and frustrated, taking care of the baby alone while he plays. The boyfriend agreed to cut back, but then he goes ahead and plays again when the baby is hungry. The author confronts him, and he doesn't understand why she's upset. She then tells him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the boyfriend's actions: he's a new father, and the author is on maternity leave, handling most of the childcare. He's in school, so maybe his schedule is tight. However, the author mentions that he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to a mess and crying. He didn't notice the baby crying nearby. The author had previously set a boundary, which he ignored. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The boyfriend agreed to stop playing when the baby is awake, but he didn't follow through. The author felt disrespected and overburdened. She's trying to set a boundary to protect her own mental health and the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for herself after repeated issues. She tried to communicate before, and when that didn't work, she set a firm boundary. The boyfriend's response was dismissive. Her reaction\u2014threatening to leave\u2014might seem extreme, but given the circumstances (new baby, lack of support, prior agreements broken), it's a reasonable step to prioritize her well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is being too harsh, but his actions (ignoring the baby's needs and previous agreement) show a lack of consideration. The author isn't the one in the wrong here. She's addressing a problem that's been ongoing and affecting their family dynamic. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
