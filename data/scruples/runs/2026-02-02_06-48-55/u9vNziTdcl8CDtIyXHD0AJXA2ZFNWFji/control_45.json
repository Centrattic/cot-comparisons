My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially after their daughter was born.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games for a couple of years. He often prioritizes gaming over spending time with her. Since the baby was born, it's gotten worse. The author feels like she's handling all the baby duties alone, and when he comes home, he plays for long periods, ignoring her and the baby. \n\nThe key incident happened when the baby puked, and she had to clean up alone while he was gaming. She told him she was upset, but he didn't get it until she said she'd leave if he continued. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she's frustrated that he didn't respect her previous warnings.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author is under a lot of stress with a new baby and minimal support. The boyfriend's behavior seems dismissive and not considering her feelings or the baby's needs. He agreed before that it was inappropriate, yet he repeated the behavior. The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, threatening to leave is a serious step. However, she's clearly communicated her concerns multiple times. The boyfriend isn't making changes, which suggests he's not prioritizing her needs or the baby's well-being. The author is taking care of the baby alone, which is a significant burden. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglectful, especially with a new child. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have found a different way to address the issue before threatening to leave. But given the context and the repeated arguments, it seems like she's at her breaking point. Her decision to set a firm boundary isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight might indicate a lack of empathy, which is part of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. She's standing up for herself and her needs, which is valid.\n"
