My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author (the girlfriend) is upset about. She feels neglected and frustrated, especially since she's on maternity leave and taking care of the baby alone. The key event was when the baby puked on her, and the boyfriend went to play games instead of helping. She told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so he's balancing that with being a parent. The author is handling the baby alone all day, which is a lot. The boyfriend's response to her frustration seems dismissive; when she told him she was upset, he didn't understand why she was mad. That's a problem because he's not acknowledging her feelings. The author gave him a clear warning before, and he still did the same thing. That might indicate he didn't take her concerns seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be using gaming as a way to cope with stress from school and parenthood. But the author is doing the bulk of the childcare and might feel overwhelmed. The fact that he left during the baby's feeding time to play for 40 minutes shows he's not supporting her, especially when she clearly needs help. The author's breaking point seems justified because she's been trying to communicate her needs, and he's not responding appropriately.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe she could have found another way to address his gaming habits without threatening to leave. But given that this is a recurring issue and he's not making changes despite her repeated concerns, her frustration is valid. The decision to leave is drastic, but in a situation where there's a lack of respect and support, it's not unreasonable. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions and lack of empathy contribute to her decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
