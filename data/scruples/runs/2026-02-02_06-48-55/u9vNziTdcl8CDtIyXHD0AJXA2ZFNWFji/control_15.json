My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is a woman with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is 27, in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games a lot. She feels neglected, especially since the baby was born. He comes home, the baby needs to eat, and he leaves to play a game for 40 minutes. During that time, the baby pukes on them, she has to clean up, and he's still playing. She confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. She tells him she's done and leaves if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a newborn, which is a major life event. The woman is handling a lot of the baby's care alone, which can be exhausting and stressful. Her boyfriend is in school, so maybe his schedule is packed, but he's still supposed to help with the baby. The key issue here is communication and mutual support. \n\nHe agreed a week before that it's inappropriate to play hours of games while she's alone with the baby. Then, when the baby is hungry, he leaves to play, leading to a mess and her having to handle it alone. She's clearly frustrated and feels disrespected. Telling him she's leaving if he doesn't stop could be seen as a strong move, but considering the circumstances, she's setting a boundary. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for herself after repeated issues. He didn't follow through on his agreement, showing a lack of respect for her feelings. Her reaction is a response to his continued behavior, which she's tried to address before. She's not just being dramatic; she's dealing with the reality of childcare without support. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it differently, like seeking a compromise or involving him more in the baby's care. But given the situation and the fact that he didn't take her previous concerns seriously, her ultimatum might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's asserting her needs in a relationship where her partner hasn't been responsive to her concerns despite prior agreements. Her actions are a result of being overwhelmed and seeking respect from her partner.\n"
