My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits. The situation involves a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend is in school full-time while the author is on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been struggling with the boyfriend's gaming for a couple of years, feeling neglected. Since the baby's birth, the stress has increased. The key incident is when the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game while the baby needed attention, leading to a messy situation. The author then confronts him, and he doesn't understand her upset, leading her to tell him she's done if he doesn't change.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions here are questionable. He agreed to a previous conversation where he acknowledged the problem but then repeated the same behavior. The author gave a clear warning, and he didn't heed it. His lack of understanding shows a lack of empathy and consideration for her feelings and the baby's needs.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary: if he doesn't change, she's leaving. This is a personal choice about her limits in the relationship. She's stating her needs and the consequences if they aren't met. While some might argue that communication could be improved, the boyfriend's repeated actions and dismissiveness might justify her decision.\n\nConsidering the emotional labor she's handling alone, the stress of caring for a newborn, and the boyfriend's inconsistent behavior, the author's decision to prioritize her well-being isn't unreasonable. Setting firm boundaries isn't being an asshole; it's about self-respect and the health of the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
