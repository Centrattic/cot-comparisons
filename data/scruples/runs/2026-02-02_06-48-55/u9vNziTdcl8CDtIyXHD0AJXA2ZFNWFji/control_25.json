My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habit. The situation involves a new baby, so that's a key point. The boyfriend is in school, and the author is on maternity leave, handling the baby alone. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing games instead of helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the boyfriend agreed to not play during a previous argument, but then he goes ahead and does it again. The specific incident described is the baby puking, and she had to handle it alone while he was gaming. The author then tells him she's leaving if he doesn't stop. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? Well, she's under a lot of stress with a new baby and isn't getting support. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive. He doesn't understand why she's upset after she already explained it. That lack of empathy or understanding might be a problem. The author felt she's been patient and given him chances to change, but he hasn't. Her decision to leave is a last resort after repeated issues.\n\nOn the flip side, is there anything the author could have done differently? Maybe tried different communication strategies? But she mentions it's been a couple of years and even after the baby was born, the issue persisted. The boyfriend's behavior isn't just occasional; it's a pattern. The threat of leaving is a response to a lack of change despite clear communication. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, I think not. She's standing up for herself after being overwhelmed and unsupported. The boyfriend's actions are neglecting both her and the baby's needs, which is a significant issue. The key here is that she's setting a boundary after multiple attempts to address the problem. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
