My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is the girlfriend of a guy who plays a lot of video games, especially after they have a newborn daughter. The main issue is that the boyfriend continues to play games despite previous agreements to not do so when the baby is awake, leading the author to threaten leaving him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a four-month-old daughter, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so he's not working, but he's still expected to help with the baby. The author is on maternity leave, so she's handling most of the childcare. This imbalance in responsibilities might be a key factor here.\n\nThe boyfriend's gaming habits have been a problem for a couple of years, but it's gotten worse since the baby was born. The author has tried to communicate her feelings before, and the boyfriend agreed to change his behavior. However, he then went ahead and played a game for 40 minutes while the baby was awake and needed care. The author felt overwhelmed, having to handle the baby alone, and when the baby puked, he was still gaming. After 20 minutes, he still didn't understand why she was upset. The author then tells him she's done and will leave if he does it again.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions seem to disregard her feelings and the previous agreement. The author is expressing her frustration, which is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn alone. She's set a boundary, and the boyfriend didn't respect it. Her threat to leave is a response to being disrespected and neglected, not just a random fight. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, seeking counseling or involving a mediator before threatening to leave. But given the cumulative stress and the fact that he didn't change his behavior despite prior warnings, her decision might be justified. The key points are communication issues, lack of support from the boyfriend, and the impact on their daughter's care.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of thinking she's picking a fight suggests he's not acknowledging her perspective, which adds to the problem. In relationships, when one partner consistently ignores the other's concerns, especially regarding childcare, it's a serious issue. The author is prioritizing her own well-being and self-respect, which is important.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions stem from a place of being overwhelmed and disrespected, and the boyfriend didn't address the problem after being warned.\n"
