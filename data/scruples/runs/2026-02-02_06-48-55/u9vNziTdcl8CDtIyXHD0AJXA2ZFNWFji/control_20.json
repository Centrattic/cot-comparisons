My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially after he continued playing despite previous warnings. \n\nFirst, the context is important. They have a four-month-old daughter, and the author is on maternity leave, handling most of the baby's care. The boyfriend is in school full-time. The issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is prioritized over her and their daughter. The user wants to know if the author is justified in her actions.\n\nLooking at the situation, the key points are:\n1. The boyfriend ignores her concerns even after agreeing to change his behavior. \n2. The author feels neglected and overworked, especially with the baby's needs.\n3. The final incident involved the baby puking, which the author handled alone while he was gaming. \n4. The author set a clear boundary and followed through on her threat when he crossed it again.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is threatening to leave an appropriate response? Does the boyfriend have a right to play games? How much responsibility does the boyfriend have in parenting?\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (playing games while the baby is crying) could be seen as neglecting his parental duties and disregarding his partner's feelings. The author's response is based on feeling disrespected and overwhelmed. Threatening to leave could be a last resort after repeated failures to communicate and resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried other methods first, like couples counseling or more structured communication. But given the context of a newborn and the boyfriend's lack of response to previous warnings, her frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often an assumption that partners should share parenting duties. If the boyfriend isn't contributing and the author feels alone, her decision to set a firm boundary isn't unreasonable. The question is whether the threat of leaving is justified when the other party hasn't made an effort to change.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her needs and boundaries in a situation where her partner hasn't shown adequate support or responsiveness. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
