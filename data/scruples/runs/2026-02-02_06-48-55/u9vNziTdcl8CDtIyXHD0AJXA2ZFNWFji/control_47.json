My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to stop playing video games or else she'll leave. The situation involves a four-month-old daughter, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming habits.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior: he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to a mess that the author has to handle alone. The baby then cries while he plays nearby. The author feels neglected and frustrated, especially since he had already agreed to stop this after a previous argument. The key points here are the repeated issue, the recent incident, and the author setting a boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is dismissive, not understanding her upset, which the author finds disrespectful. She's had enough and threatens to leave. The question is whether she's wrong for doing so.\n\nConsidering the context: the author is managing a newborn alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's actions in this case seem to ignore her needs and the baby's. Even though he's in school, his behavior crosses a line by not supporting her as agreed. The author is setting a boundary after multiple warnings, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's lack of empathy and follow-through after agreeing to change is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't wrong to be upset; she's in a stressful situation needing support. The boyfriend's actions show a lack of respect for her feelings and the agreement they had. Her decision to leave is a response to his consistent disregard for her boundaries. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
