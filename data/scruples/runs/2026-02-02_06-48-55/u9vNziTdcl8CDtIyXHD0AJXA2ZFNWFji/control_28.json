My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, and the author, who's on maternity leave with their four-month-old daughter, is upset because he's not helping with the baby and instead plays games. She told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and now he's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a newborn, which is a huge adjustment. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so maybe he's managing that while also trying to be a parent. The author is handling the baby alone during the day and then when he comes home, he plays games, leading to her feeling neglected and frustrated. The example given is when the baby puked on her, and he was 10 feet away playing. She told him she's done if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. She had previously discussed her feelings with him, and he agreed to change his behavior. But he didn't follow through, leading to her frustration. Her reaction is to set a boundary by saying she's leaving if it happens again. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when one partner's behavior consistently causes distress despite discussions, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. However, the boyfriend might feel that he's being unfairly targeted, especially if he's under stress from school and work. But given that the author is managing the baby alone and the situation led to a specific incident where he ignored her boundaries, her reaction seems justified.\n\nThe user's question is about whether she's the asshole. The options are A for yes, B for no. Considering the context, she's standing up for her needs after repeated issues, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's failure to respect her boundaries after agreeing to change could be seen as the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). But I should also check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like if she gave him enough chances or if there's more to his side. Since the story is from her perspective, it's possible he has his own stressors, but the core of the issue is her feeling disrespected and neglected, which is a valid reason to set a boundary.\n"
