My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author, who's on maternity leave, is frustrated because he prioritizes gaming over helping with the baby. They've had arguments in the past, and the latest incident was when he left to play during the baby's feeding time, leading to the baby puking and the author being upset. The author told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so he's balancing school and being a new dad. The author is handling the baby alone during the day and then he plays games at home. The specific incident happened when he left to play during feeding, leading to a mess. The author gave a clear warning before, and he still continued. She feels disrespected and decides to end the relationship if it happens again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that. The boyfriend might argue that he's under stress from school and maybe he's trying to manage his time. But the author is dealing with the emotional and physical burden of caring for the baby alone, which is a significant stressor. The key points are communication and respect. The author had previously discussed the issue, and the boyfriend agreed but didn't follow through. The author's response was to set a boundary and threaten to leave if it happens again.\n\nIs threatening to leave over this issue justified? Well, in a relationship, both partners should consider each other's feelings and responsibilities. The author is taking on a lot and feels unsupported. The boyfriend's actions (playing during critical times) might be seen as neglecting his share of parental duties. The author is standing up for her needs, which is valid. However, threatening to leave over one incident might be seen as extreme. But considering the ongoing pattern and the previous agreement, it's a matter of whether the author's frustration is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not realize the severity of his actions. The author had to handle the baby alone during a time when help would be necessary. The fact that he's in school could mean he's busy, but being a parent also requires adjusting priorities. The author's decision to set a firm boundary could be seen as self-respect rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. She's addressing a repeated issue that affects her well-being and the baby's care. The boyfriend's actions show a lack of consideration, and the author is asserting her needs. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
