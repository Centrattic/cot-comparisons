My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's video game habits, which the author feels are taking precedence over their relationship and his responsibilities as a father.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's perspective. The author has repeatedly expressed concerns about her boyfriend playing too much, even agreeing on a compromise after the baby was born. However, the boyfriend continues to prioritize gaming over helping with the baby and spending time with her. The latest incident involved the baby puking on them while the boyfriend was gaming, leading the author to set a firm boundary and threaten to leave if it happens again.\n\nNow, looking at the boyfriend's side as presented, he didn't seem to understand why she was upset after he played during the baby's feeding time. He might think he's just taking a break, not realizing the emotional impact of his actions. However, the author has clearly communicated her boundaries multiple times, and he's ignored them, which could indicate a lack of respect or consideration for her feelings and the baby's needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave if he doesn't stop gaming. The author's main argument is that she's been patient, set clear boundaries, and now feels it's necessary to protect her own well-being. From a relationship dynamics perspective, when one partner consistently disregards the other's feelings despite communication, it's reasonable for the affected partner to take action to protect themselves. Setting a firm boundary like leaving is a serious step, but it's often a last resort when other methods have failed.\n\nI should also consider the context of their situation. The author is on maternity leave, handling all the baby's care alone, which is already a significant burden. The boyfriend, while in school, might have less time, but the issue is about the time he does have and how he prioritizes it. The fact that he agreed to the compromise earlier but didn't follow through suggests a lack of follow-through on his part. The author's frustration is understandable given the stress of caring for a newborn and feeling unsupported.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional labor. The author is not only dealing with the physical demands of baby care but also the emotional strain of feeling neglected. The boyfriend's gaming during critical times (like when the baby is crying) adds to that emotional burden. The author's decision to leave is a response to being undervalued and disrespected, which are valid reasons for ending a relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and relationship expectations, mutual respect and support are crucial. The boyfriend's actions (or inactions) in this case show a lack of support, which is a red flag. The author is asserting her needs and self-respect, which is a healthy approach in any relationship. Threatening to leave isn't a sign of being in the wrong; it's a reaction to ongoing neglect and the need for change.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have given more time or tried different communication methods. But considering the timeline of the problem (couple of years) and the recent agreement that was broken, it's reasonable for her to feel that she's reached her limit. The key here is that the author has made her feelings known, and the boyfriend hasn't made an effort to change, which is the boyfriend's fault, not the author's.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and the well-being of her child in a situation where her partner isn't meeting his responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not the author's decision to set a boundary.\n"
