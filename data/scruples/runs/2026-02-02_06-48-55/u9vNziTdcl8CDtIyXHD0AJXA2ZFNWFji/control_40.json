My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author of the story (the girlfriend) feels neglected, especially since she's on maternity leave and handling most of the baby's care. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so maybe his schedule is busy. The author says they've been arguing about his gaming for a couple of years, and since the baby was born, it's gotten worse. The main incident here is when the baby puked, the author had to deal with it alone while he was gaming, and she told him she'd leave if he didn't stop. He doesn't seem to understand why she's upset, and she's now threatening to leave.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The author is expressing frustration about being the sole caregiver and feeling ignored. The boyfriend agreed before that his gaming was a problem, but then he still played when she asked him not to. She's setting a boundary by saying she'll leave if he doesn't change. \n\nI think her feelings are valid because she's dealing with a new baby and needs support. The boyfriend not respecting her request after agreeing to it shows a lack of consideration. However, maybe she could have approached it differently? Like, maybe tried more communication or compromise first? But given that she already tried and he's not respecting her boundaries, threatening to leave isn't unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's overreacting or being too harsh. But considering the context of her responsibilities and his inaction despite prior agreement, her reaction makes sense. So I think she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
