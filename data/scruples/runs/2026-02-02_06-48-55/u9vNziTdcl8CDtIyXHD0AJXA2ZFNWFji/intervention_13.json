My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the author is upset with her boyfriend for playing too many video games, especially after they have a baby. She's been arguing about this for a while, and the latest incident made her tell him she'll leave if he doesn't stop. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but she's saying it's about respecting herself.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the couple's responsibilities with their newborn, the boyfriend's gaming habits, and the communication issues. The author mentions that he's in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. So, she's handling most of the baby's care, which is a lot of work. The problem started before the baby, but it's gotten worse since the baby was born.\n\nThe specific incident: the baby is hungry, takes 10 minutes to eat. He leaves to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby pukes, and she has to handle the mess alone. Then, when she returns, the baby is crying, and he's still gaming. She confronts him, but he doesn't understand her upset. She then gives an ultimatum about leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he doesn't think she's in the wrong. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Wait, no\u2014the user says \"I think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\" So the user is asking for an evaluation.\n\nNow, to decide: is the author wrong for threatening to leave? Factors to consider: communication, mutual respect, and the situation's context. The author tried multiple times to communicate her feelings. He agreed to the concerns before, but then repeated the behavior. The author felt she's taking care of everything and is being ignored. The boyfriend not understanding her upset might indicate a lack of empathy or communication.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to address issues constructively. The author set a boundary after prior warnings, which he breached again. Her reaction is a consequence of his not respecting her boundaries. However, threatening to leave is a serious step. But considering the stress of caring for a newborn alone and prior unresolved issues, her frustration is understandable.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he didn't realize it was problematic, but given that she had clearly stated her boundaries and he still acted the same, his lack of action could be seen as dismissive. The author's ultimatum is a response to ongoing disrespect of her needs and the baby's needs.\n\nSo, in this case, while the author's threat might be extreme, the boyfriend's repeated disregard for her and the baby's needs after being told multiple times is a significant issue. Therefore, it's more the boyfriend's fault for not changing his behavior, not the author's for setting a boundary.\n"
