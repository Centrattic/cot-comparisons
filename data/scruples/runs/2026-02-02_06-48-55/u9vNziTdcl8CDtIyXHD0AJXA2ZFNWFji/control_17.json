My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend (27M) is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels like she's being neglected, especially since they have a baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline. They've been arguing about this for a couple of years. The author has expressed her frustration multiple times, even after the baby was born. She mentioned feeling like she's taking the back burner and that he's dismissive, saying things like, \"if you can find something for us to do then I'll hang out with you.\" That sounds pretty passive-aggressive and not supportive, especially with a newborn.\n\nThen, the recent incident: the baby is hungry, eats, and then pukes on the author and herself. The author has to clean up, get new clothes, and when she comes back, the baby is crying while the boyfriend is playing PlayStation nearby. She confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. She then tells him she's done and will leave if it happens again. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the author has repeatedly communicated her concerns. The boyfriend didn't change his behavior despite agreeing to do so. The incident in question is a direct violation of the prior agreement. The author is now setting a boundary by saying she's leaving if it happens again.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, maybe he's stressed with school and the baby, but he should be sharing the responsibilities. The author is carrying the load alone, which is a lot. The boyfriend's reaction of not understanding why she's upset suggests he's not empathizing with her situation.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, she's been trying to communicate for a long time, and the recent incident was a breaking point. She's setting a boundary because she's not being respected or supported. The boyfriend's inaction despite knowing it's upsetting her might mean he's not meeting his responsibilities as a partner and co-parent.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend had valid reasons for playing, like stress relief. But with a newborn, both partners need to adjust their habits. The author is taking on more childcare duties, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up. His behavior is neglecting her emotional needs and the baby's needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the one in the wrong. She's trying to address a consistent issue, has communicated her needs, and is now setting a boundary. The boyfriend isn't meeting the expectations he agreed to. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
