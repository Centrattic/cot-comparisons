My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a young daughter, and the main issue is the boyfriend's video game habits. The author, who's on maternity leave, feels neglected when the boyfriend plays games instead of helping with the baby.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, so his schedule might be tight. However, after school, he's home with the baby. The author feels like she's taking a backseat to his gaming. The key incident is when the baby pukes on her, and the boyfriend goes to play a game for 40 minutes. The author confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. She then threatens to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe boyfriend agreed five days prior that gaming during that time was okay but now he's doing it again. The author's frustration is about the lack of support and respect. She's been trying to communicate her needs, but he's not following through. The question is whether her response (threatening to leave) is justified.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is key. The author has tried to express her feelings multiple times, and the boyfriend hasn't changed his behavior despite agreeing to do so. The fact that the baby is involved adds to the emotional weight because the author is handling all the childcare alone, which can be overwhelming. The boyfriend's inaction might indicate a lack of consideration for her well-being and the baby's needs.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend is dealing with school stress and using gaming as a coping mechanism. But given that he has agreed previously to adjust his gaming habits and then ignored it, it shows a pattern of not respecting her boundaries. The author's decision to set a firm boundary (leaving) is a response to chronic disrespect, not just a single incident. In this context, her actions seem justified because she's setting a limit for her own well-being and the health of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering the repeated issues and lack of change from the boyfriend, the author isn't the asshole. She's asserting her needs after multiple failed attempts to communicate, which is a reasonable step in a healthy relationship.\n"
