My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits.\n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing video games, with her feeling neglected. Recently, he played for 40 minutes while the baby was crying, leading her to say she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's perspective might be that he's stressed from school and using games to unwind. He might not realize the impact of his actions. The author feels that he doesn't respect her or their child, especially since she's handling most of the baby's care alone.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author has tried to discuss the issue before, and the boyfriend agreed to change but didn't follow through. The incident where he left to play while the baby was crying is a significant stressor. The author's reaction is a culmination of ongoing frustration.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel heard and valued. If one partner repeatedly ignores the other's concerns, especially in a situation where the other is shouldering most responsibilities (like childcare), that can lead to justified frustration. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is a healthy step in a relationship. However, threatening to leave might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, some might argue it's a response to long-term neglect.\n\nThe community response to AITA posts often looks at intent and history. The author isn't just making a one-time accusation; this is a recurring issue. The boyfriend's actions post-agreement still didn't change, indicating a possible lack of respect. Therefore, the author's decision to set a firm boundary might be seen as justified, making her not the asshole.\n"
