My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too much video games, especially when they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing games more than she'd like. The key incident is when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is up, leading to the baby puking and the author being overwhelmed. She tells him she's done, and he doesn't get why she's upset. She threatens to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nNow, considering the context. They have a young child, which adds significant stress and responsibility. The author is handling all the care alone, which is a lot. The boyfriend's actions here seem dismissive of her needs and the baby's needs. Even after agreeing to the problem, he fails to act on it, which shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nThe author's response is about setting boundaries and self-respect. She's communicated multiple times, and when he doesn't change his behavior, she's taking a stand. Threatening to leave when there's a pattern of neglect and lack of support in parenting isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend not understanding her frustration is part of the problem. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe he's stressed from school, or the gaming is his way to unwind. But even so, prioritizing self-care over supporting his partner during a challenging time isn't justified. The author's needs and the baby's well-being should come first. Also, the fact that he agreed to the problem before but didn't act on it shows a lack of commitment to changing his behavior.\n\nIn terms of respect and communication, the author is trying to address a consistent issue. The boyfriend's response (not understanding why she's upset) indicates poor communication and unwillingness to adjust, which is a problem in a relationship. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is a healthy action in a relationship where mutual respect is lacking.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself and her needs after repeated issues, which is valid.\n"
