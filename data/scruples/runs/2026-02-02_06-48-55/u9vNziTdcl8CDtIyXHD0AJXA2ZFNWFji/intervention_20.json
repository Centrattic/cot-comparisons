My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author is upset because he's prioritizing gaming over helping with the baby and their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they've been arguing about this for years. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. That might mean she's doing most of the childcare. The key incident happened when the baby was crying while he was playing, and after she told him she was upset, he didn't respond until 20 minutes later. Then she said she's done and would leave if he didn't stop.\n\nThe boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but the author argues that she had warned him before. The main issue here is whether the author overreacted. The boyfriend didn't change his behavior despite previous warnings. The author is taking a strong stance, saying she's leaving if he doesn't stop. But is that too harsh?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author tried talking to him before, but he didn't change. Maybe she escalated too quickly? But considering the stress of caring for a newborn alone, it's understandable. The boyfriend's inconsiderate action of leaving when the baby needed help is a problem. However, using the threat of leaving might be a heavy-handed response, but if she's been exhausted and frustrated, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The community usually considers intent and reasonableness. The author's actions stem from legitimate frustration. The boyfriend not respecting her boundaries is the issue. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a middle ground she could have taken. Maybe setting clearer consequences or seeking couples' counseling before breaking up? But given the circumstances, breaking up over this might be a last resort after failed communication. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. The author's actions are a response to neglect and previous warnings not being heeded. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
