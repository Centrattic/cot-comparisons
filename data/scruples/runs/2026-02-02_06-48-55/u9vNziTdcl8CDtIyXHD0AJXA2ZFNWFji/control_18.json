My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author (a woman) is upset because her boyfriend plays video games a lot, especially when their four-month-old daughter is awake and needs attention. They had a previous argument where he agreed to cut down, but she's frustrated because he still does it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. So she's the one handling most of the childcare during the day. When he comes home, the baby is hungry, takes 10 minutes to feed, and then he leaves to play a game for 40 minutes. During that time, the baby vomits, and the author has to clean up both the baby and herself. When she gets back, the baby is crying, and he's still gaming nearby. She confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. After this incident, she tells him she's done arguing and will leave next time.\n\nThe author is asking if she's the asshole for threatening to leave. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. She's dealing with a newborn, which is a lot of work. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be a recurring issue. They had an agreement, but he didn't follow through. The author's frustration is justified because she's handling all the childcare alone and then he's not there when she needs support. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to set a boundary and say she can't continue if he doesn't respect it? Relationships require mutual respect and effort. If one partner consistently disregards the other's feelings and needs, especially in a caregiving situation, it's valid to address it. Threatening to leave in this case might be a last resort after previous failed attempts to resolve the issue. \n\nHowever, maybe there's more to the story. The boyfriend is in school, so he might be stressed or have time management issues. The author is on maternity leave, so she might feel isolated. But the fact that he agreed before and still did it now suggests he didn't take her concerns seriously. The author's actions are a response to his lack of follow-through. \n\nIn these situations, it's hard to say who's in the wrong without more context. But given the information, the author is standing up for herself after repeated issues, which is often seen as justified. The boyfriend not understanding her frustration after being told could indicate a lack of consideration. So the answer might be B (no), she's not in the wrong.\n"
