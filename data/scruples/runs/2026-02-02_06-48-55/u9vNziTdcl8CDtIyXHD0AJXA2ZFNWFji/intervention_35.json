My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a woman with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've been having arguments about him playing video games a lot. The key points from the story are that she feels neglected, especially since the baby was born, and he's been prioritizing gaming over helping with the baby. The last straw was when he left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating, leading to the baby puking and her having to clean up alone. She told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. So, first, the author is expressing her frustration about the balance of responsibilities. New parents often have to adjust their habits, and it's reasonable for her to expect her partner to share the load, especially since he's home during the day. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he has time constraints, but he's not working? The author is on maternity leave, so she's probably handling more of the childcare, which is common but can be stressful.\n\nThe arguments about video games have been ongoing for a couple of years. She's felt like she's taking a backseat to his gaming. Then, after the baby's birth, it's worse. She confronted him recently, and he agreed. But then he did it again, leading to the incident where the baby puked and she had to handle everything alone. She told him she's leaving if he continues. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she's clearly stressed and overwhelmed. The baby is only four months old, so the demands are high. She's asking for support, and his continued gaming suggests he's not prioritizing her needs. This could be neglect in a partnership. On the other hand, maybe he's trying to decompress after school, and she's being too harsh. But given the context\u2014he knew she had a problem with it, agreed to change, then repeated the behavior. That seems like he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author's ultimatum might seem extreme, but given the circumstances and the history, it's a way of setting a boundary. If communication has failed and he's not respecting her feelings, then she's justified in saying she can't stay. It's a tough situation, but her actions are a response to his lack of support. So, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
