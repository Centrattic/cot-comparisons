My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation involves the author, who is on maternity leave, taking care of a four-month-old daughter alone. Her boyfriend, who's 27 and in school full-time, plays a lot of video games. They've been arguing about this for years. The key incident is when the baby pukes on them, and the boyfriend leaves to play a game for 40 minutes instead of helping. The author confronts him, and after he finishes, he doesn't understand her upset. She then tells him she's done and will leave if he does it again.\n\nSo, the main points here are the ongoing issue of the boyfriend prioritizing gaming over helping with the baby, the recent incident where he didn't help during a crisis, and her ultimatum. The boyfriend's response is dismissive, thinking she's picking a fight. \n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions seem to disregard her needs and the baby's care. The author is taking on all the childcare responsibilities and feels neglected. Her ultimatum is a response to repeated behavior despite previous agreements. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend's actions suggest he doesn't take her concerns seriously, which can erode trust and respect. The author's frustration is understandable given the context of a newborn and the lack of support. Her decision to set a boundary by saying she'll leave if it happens again is a valid choice when her needs aren't met. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried more to resolve the issue before threatening to leave. But considering the timeline (months of arguments and a recent agreement), her response seems proportionate. The boyfriend's lack of empathy in the recent incident exacerbates the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her needs and the importance of partnership in parenting. The boyfriend's behavior is the root problem, not her standing up for herself. The answer should be B.\n"
