My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is a person in a relationship with a boyfriend who plays a lot of video games, which is causing conflict, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave, so they're managing the baby alone. There's been a history of arguments about the gaming habits. The boyfriend has been prioritizing games over spending time with the author and the baby. The latest incident involves the baby needing care, the boyfriend leaving to play for 40 minutes, leading to the baby puking and the author handling everything alone. The author then tells the boyfriend she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and he thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider the context. The author has been dealing with this issue for years, and after the birth of their child, the stress is higher. The boyfriend's actions are seen as neglecting responsibilities, both to the author and the baby. The author is frustrated and has reached a breaking point, giving a final warning. However, is threatening to leave justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for herself and her needs, which is valid. On the other hand, maybe there's a lack of communication or attempts to find a solution other than threatening to end the relationship. But given the circumstances\u2014caring for a newborn alone, repeated arguments, and the boyfriend not following through on previous agreements\u2014it seems the author's reaction is a culmination of unresolved issues. The boyfriend's behavior might be contributing to the problem, but the author's response is a significant step (threatening to leave). \n\nHowever, in relationships, both parties have responsibilities. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby and is dismissing her feelings. The author is taking a stand, which could be seen as reasonable given the stress and lack of support. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe they should have addressed it differently. But given the context, the author's actions are a response to ongoing neglect, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. The author did give previous warnings, and the boyfriend didn't change his behavior. The final incident was a trigger. So the author's threat is a result of being pushed to the limit. In that case, maybe B is correct.\n"
