My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he keeps playing video games when she's struggling with their newborn. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had arguments about him playing games for a while. The author feels like she's being neglected, especially with the baby. The last incident was when the baby puked, she had to clean up alone while he was gaming. She told him earlier that if he keeps doing this, she'll leave.\n\nHe plays even when he's supposed to help, and after she confronts him again, he doesn't understand her upset. She then tells him she's done and will leave if it happens again. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she's saying she's had enough.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author is the primary caregiver because she's on maternity leave. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he's not working. The issue is his lack of support during the baby's needs. The author is clearly stressed and overwhelmed. The boyfriend's actions (playing games during these times) don't show empathy or support, which is a problem in a relationship where teamwork is essential, especially with a newborn.\n\nThe boyfriend's response after the incident is dismissive. He didn't acknowledge her feelings, even though she had told him before. The author's threat to leave is a response to his consistent lack of support. In such situations, communication is key, but he's not responding positively. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. She's trying to protect her own well-being and the family's needs. Threatening to leave is a strong move, but given the circumstances, it's a valid reaction if his behavior doesn't change. The boyfriend's actions are the root of the problem here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
