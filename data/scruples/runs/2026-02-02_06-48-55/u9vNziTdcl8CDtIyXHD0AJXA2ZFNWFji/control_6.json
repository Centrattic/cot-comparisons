My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is the boyfriend's excessive video game playing, which the author feels is taking precedence over their relationship and responsibilities as a parent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been arguing about this for a couple of years. The boyfriend has said things like, \"if you can find something for us to do then I'll hang out, otherwise I'll play games.\" Since the baby was born, the author is more upset because she's handling everything alone. The boyfriend agreed to stop playing during the baby's nap time, but then he went ahead and played for 40 minutes while the baby was up and crying. The author told him this was the last time she'd argue, and if he does it again, she'll leave. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments from both sides. The boyfriend is a student, so maybe he's under a lot of stress and gaming is his way to unwind. However, the author is on maternity leave and is dealing with the baby alone. The baby had just eaten and was crying, and the boyfriend was playing nearby. Even though he agreed to stop before, he didn't follow through. The author felt disrespected and that her feelings weren't being considered. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem to disregard the author's feelings and their shared responsibilities as parents. Even if gaming is a way for him to cope, the immediate needs of the baby and the author's emotional state are important. The fact that he agreed to change his behavior but then repeated the same action suggests a lack of follow-through. The author's frustration is valid, especially with the added stress of caring for a newborn. \n\nHowever, the author did give him an ultimatum in a heated moment. While it's understandable, some might argue that giving such a serious threat without further discussion or attempts to resolve the issue could be seen as harsh. But given the context\u2014ongoing issues, previous agreements broken\u2014it might be seen as a reasonable response after repeated failures to address her concerns.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably or without understanding. Here, the boyfriend's lack of empathy and follow-through on his promises might make him the asshole. The author's response, while strong, is in response to consistent neglect and broken commitments. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
