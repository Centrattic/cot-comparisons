My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she'll leave him if he doesn't stop playing video games. The situation involves them having a four-month-old daughter, with the boyfriend in school and the author on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, the key points from her story: They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming. She feels neglected, especially since the baby was born. After a specific incident where he left to play during the baby's feeding, leading to a mess and her frustration, she sets a clear boundary that if he doesn't stop, she's leaving. He doesn't understand her upset, and she ends the argument by threatening to leave.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective isn't detailed much, but he agreed before that his gaming was an issue. However, he still plays when he shouldn't, according to her. She feels disrespected and that he doesn't care about her feelings. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The main factors are communication, mutual respect, and the impact on their child. She's communicated her concerns multiple times, and even set a boundary. He didn't adhere to it, which she sees as a lack of respect. Her decision to leave is based on feeling unvalued and the stress of handling everything alone. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner repeatedly disregards the other's boundaries and feelings, it's a sign of deeper issues. Her actions are a response to ongoing neglect, not just a one-time fight. The fact that he dismissed her feelings after she clearly stated her position might indicate he isn't taking her seriously, which is a valid reason for her to consider ending the relationship.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe he has his own stressors (school, being a new parent), but the problem is his gaming affects her and their child. The author isn't just being overly sensitive; she's handling the baby alone and needs support. Her boundary is about mutual respect and partnership. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs after repeated issues and has clearly communicated her boundaries. His failure to respect those boundaries is the main issue here.\n"
