My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend playing too many video games, leading to conflict when the partner is caring for their newborn.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the partner is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The main issue is the boyfriend's gaming habits, which the partner feels are prioritized over her and the baby's needs. \n\nShe's been arguing about this for years, and he agreed to change after her recent outburst. But then he went ahead and played a 40-minute game while the baby was up, leading to a mess and her frustration. She's now telling him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because caring for a newborn is exhausting, and she's asking for support. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be stressed from school and using gaming as a coping mechanism. But he did agree to change his behavior after being told it's upsetting her. The fact that he continued despite knowing her boundaries could be a key point here.\n\nThe critical factor is whether her ultimatum is reasonable. She gave him a clear boundary, and he crossed it, leading to her decision to leave. In relationships, mutual respect and compromise are essential. If he's not respecting her boundaries after agreeing to, that's a problem. Her frustration is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nAlso, the immediate situation where he left her alone during the baby's meal time and the subsequent mess adds to the stress. The boyfriend not understanding why she's upset after breaking his agreement might indicate a lack of empathy, which is significant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to a lack of respect for her boundaries and the baby's needs. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
