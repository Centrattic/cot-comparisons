My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author's boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and after a specific incident, she threatens to leave him if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a parent with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming habits. She feels neglected and that he's not helping with the baby. The key incident is when he leaves to play a game for 40 minutes while the baby is up and crying, leading her to confront him and say she's done if he doesn't change.\n\nHer boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight. The author argues that she gave him a clear warning five days ago, and since he didn't heed it, she's justified in her reaction. The question is whether her response was in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's dealing with the stress of caring for an infant alone, which is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend's actions seem dismissive, as evidenced by the specific example given. She's communicated her boundaries, and when he ignores them, she's asserting her right to leave a relationship where her needs aren't respected. Her actions could be seen as self-respect and necessary for her well-being, especially given the context of parenthood.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the threat to leave is an overreaction. However, the author's frustration is rooted in consistent behavior that hasn't changed despite prior discussions. The fact that he didn't acknowledge her concerns after clearly being told shows a lack of responsiveness. The situation involves childcare responsibilities, which adds weight to her perspective.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself in a situation where her partner hasn't respected her boundaries, especially in a critical time with their child. The answer should be B (No).\n"
