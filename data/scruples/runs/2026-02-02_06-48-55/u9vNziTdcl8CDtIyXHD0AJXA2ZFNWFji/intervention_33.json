My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. There's a recurring issue where the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author feels is prioritizing games over their relationship and her needs, especially after the baby's birth.\n\nThe key points here are the communication and the actions of both parties. The author mentions that they've had arguments about this for years, and recently told her boyfriend it's inappropriate for him to play hours of games while she's alone with the baby. He agreed, but then later, when the baby needed attention, he went to play a 40-minute game. The author felt this was a breach of their agreement and decided to end the relationship, telling him she'd leave if he didn't stop. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction is justified. She's clearly stressed from caring for the baby alone and the boyfriend isn't helping. The boyfriend's actions here\u2014playing games while the baby is crying\u2014seem neglectful. Even if he agreed before not to play during such times, he did so again, which the author perceives as a lack of respect. The author's ultimatum about leaving might be a strong move, but given the circumstances, she's dealing with significant stress and a lack of support.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is overreacting, especially if he didn't realize the severity of the situation. However, the baby was crying and the author was overwhelmed, and his choice to play games instead of helping could be seen as irresponsible. The author's decision to end the relationship is a last resort after repeated issues, which might be a valid step if she believes he's not changing despite her efforts to communicate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself in a situation where she's been neglected and stressed. The boyfriend's actions contributed to the problem, and her response, while firm, is a reflection of her needs not being met. So, the answer is B.\n"
