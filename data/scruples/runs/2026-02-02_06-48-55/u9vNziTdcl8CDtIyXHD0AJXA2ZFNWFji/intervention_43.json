My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially since they have a four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games. The author feels neglected and upset because she's handling all the baby care alone, and he plays games when he gets home. The key incident is when the baby puked, she had to deal with it alone while he was playing, and after she told him that this was unacceptable, he continued to play. The author then tells him she's done and will leave if he does it again.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's been clear about the issue before, and he didn't change his behavior. She feels disrespected and that he doesn't care about her feelings. Her threat to leave is a response to his inaction despite prior warnings.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglecting his responsibilities in the relationship, especially with a newborn. The author is taking on a significant amount of childcare, which is stressful and tiring. The boyfriend's response to her previous confrontation was agreement, but he didn't follow through. This lack of action might indicate he isn't taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe author's decision to set a boundary and walk away isn't inherently wrong. In a healthy relationship, communication and respect are key. If one partner repeatedly ignores the other's needs and shows no effort to change, it's reasonable to reevaluate the relationship. However, the threat to leave over a single incident might be seen as extreme, but given the context of ongoing issues and the stress of caring for a newborn, it could be a justified response.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is overreacting, but considering the cumulative effect of his behavior and the specific incident where the baby puked and he was playing, her reaction seems valid. The author is not the one ignoring the problem; she's trying to address it. The boyfriend's failure to act on her previous warnings is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. She's standing up for herself and setting a boundary after repeated issues. The boyfriend's inaction is the core problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
