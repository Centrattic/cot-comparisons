My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend playing video games while the author, who's on maternity leave, is struggling with their four-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is in school full-time, so his schedule might be packed. The author has been on maternity leave, which means she's the primary caregiver, dealing with the baby's needs all day. The boyfriend agreed to stop gaming during certain times when the baby is up, but he still did it. The author then threatens to leave him if he doesn't stop. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is clearly stressed. Taking care of a newborn is exhausting, and the lack of support can be overwhelming. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglecting his responsibilities as a parent and partner. The fact that he agreed to change his behavior but didn't follow through might indicate a lack of respect for her feelings. \n\nHowever, I should also consider the boyfriend's perspective. Maybe he used gaming as a way to unwind after a long day of school. If they had an agreement but he broke it, that's on him. The author's communication seems direct, but maybe she could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries or seeking counseling. \n\nThe key points are: the author is doing most of the childcare, the boyfriend didn't adhere to their agreement, and she's made it clear that this is a dealbreaker. In relationships, mutual respect and effort are crucial. If one partner consistently dismisses the other's concerns, especially regarding their child, that's a red flag. \n\nSo, the author's reaction is understandable. She's standing up for herself and her needs. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
