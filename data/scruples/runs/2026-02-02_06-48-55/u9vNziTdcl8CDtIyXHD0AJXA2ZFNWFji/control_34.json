My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over him playing video games, especially with their newborn daughter.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 27, in school full-time, and they have a four-month-old. The author is on maternity leave. So she's handling a lot of the childcare alone. The boyfriend has been playing video games a lot, which the author feels is prioritizing games over her and their daughter. \n\nShe mentioned arguments in the past, and even though the boyfriend agreed to cut back, he still played for 40 minutes while the baby was crying. The author got upset, told him she's done, and if he does it again she'll leave. The boyfriend thinks she's overreacting. \n\nNow, the key points. The author is taking care of the baby alone all day, which is a huge responsibility. The boyfriend's actions (leaving to play games when the baby is up) seem dismissive of her needs and the baby's needs. Even after agreeing to change, he didn't follow through. The author is not just upset about the games but the lack of support and respect. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, threatening to leave a relationship over this could be seen as extreme, but given the context of her being overwhelmed and the boyfriend not respecting her feelings despite prior agreements, it might be justified. The boyfriend's behavior is contributing to the problem. \n\nBut maybe the author could have tried other steps first, like couples counseling or setting clearer boundaries. However, she has already tried to address it multiple times. The situation is a result of ongoing issues, so her conclusion that she can't continue like this might be reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is in school, which is also demanding. But the balance here seems off. The author is handling most of the childcare, and his response to her needs is insufficient. \n\nIn terms of the question, whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her actions (threatening to leave) are justified given the boyfriend's behavior and the lack of progress in resolving the issue. Since she's trying to address a pattern of behavior that's affecting their family dynamics and her well-being, I think she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
