My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits. She has a four-month-old daughter, and he's in school full-time. She's on maternity leave, handling most of the baby care alone, and he plays games a lot. They've had ongoing arguments about this.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend agreed a week ago that his gaming was a problem. Then, when the baby needed him, he left to play, leading to a messy situation. The author is upset, tells him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop. He doesn't understand why she's upset. She's using the phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), and the user is wondering if she's wrong.\n\nHmm. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is in school and plays games while the author is handling the baby alone. They had a prior agreement that he would stop gaming when the baby is awake. But he broke that agreement. The author is frustrated, having to deal with the baby's mess and crying alone. She's given him prior warnings. Now, she's threatening to leave after he disrespects her boundaries again. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to set a boundary and enforce it? If he's not respecting her and the baby's needs, maybe she's justified. On the other hand, threatening to leave in a moment of anger could be seen as extreme. But given the context of ongoing issues, multiple arguments, and the importance of partnership in parenting, maybe her reaction is valid. She's trying to protect her mental health and the well-being of their daughter. The boyfriend's reaction of not understanding why she's upset suggests he's not considering her perspective, which is part of the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and she's standing up for herself after repeated issues. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
