My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially since she's on maternity leave and handling the baby alone. \n\nSo, the key points here: the boyfriend is in school full-time. The author is dealing with the baby all day, and when the boyfriend comes home, he sometimes plays video games instead of helping. There's been ongoing arguments about this. Recently, the boyfriend left to play a game while the baby was eating, leading to the baby puking, and the author had to handle the mess alone. After the boyfriend finished the game, he didn't understand why she was upset.\n\nThe author then says she's done arguing and will leave if he does it again. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight. The author argues that she warned him five days ago, and he still did it, showing he doesn't care or respect her. She's asking if she's the asshole for threatening to leave.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, she's under a lot of stress. Taking care of a newborn is exhausting, and she's doing it without help. The boyfriend's actions are contributing to her stress. She's given him clear warnings, but he's not changing his behavior. She's asserting her needs and setting a boundary, which is understandable. The boyfriend not helping with the baby when he's home could be seen as not supporting her.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has a right to some downtime, especially if he's in school. But with a newborn, the demands are high, and the author is the primary caregiver now. The boyfriend leaving to play during a critical time when the baby needed attention seems like negligence. The author is trying to communicate her needs, and the boyfriend isn't listening. \n\nThe question is whether threatening to leave is justified. In relationships, setting boundaries is important. If the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries despite her efforts to communicate, the author has the right to feel that the relationship isn't meeting her needs. Threatening to leave might be a strong move, but given the circumstances, it's a serious decision. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014thinking she's picking a fight\u2014suggests a lack of empathy, which is problematic. If someone is in a relationship and their partner's actions consistently hurt them, it's reasonable to consider their own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a legitimate issue that affects their relationship and her well-being. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here, not her setting a boundary.\n"
