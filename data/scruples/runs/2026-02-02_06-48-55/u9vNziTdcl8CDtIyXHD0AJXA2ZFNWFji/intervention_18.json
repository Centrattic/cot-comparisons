My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who has a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is 27 and in school full-time, while she's on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games a lot, especially since the baby was born. The main issue is that he spends a lot of time gaming, which the author feels makes her take the backseat. She mentions that he's told her to find activities for them to do, otherwise he'll play games. After the baby was born, she's been more upset about this. Recently, she told him it's inappropriate for him to spend hours on games while she's alone with the baby. He agreed at the time. But then, when the baby was hungry, he left to play a 40-minute game. During that time, the baby puked, and the author had to clean up, and when she came back, he was still playing. She told him she was upset, but he didn't get it. She then told him this was the last time she'd argue and that next time she'd leave. He thinks she's picking a fight, but she argues that he either doesn't care or respect her, so she's leaving.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. The answer options are A (Yes, author is in the wrong) or B (No, author is not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The boyfriend is in school full-time and the author is on maternity leave, so their roles are different. The author is handling a lot of the baby care. The boyfriend plays games a lot, which the author finds frustrating. They had a previous discussion where he agreed to not play during certain times. However, he still played when the baby needed attention. The author is upset because he's not respecting her boundaries and their child's needs. She's threatening to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation: Communication is a key factor here. The author has expressed her concerns multiple times, and he agreed but didn't follow through. His action of leaving to play during the baby's feeding time, leading to the baby puking and her having to clean up alone, seems to be a significant stressor. The author's frustration is understandable. She's shouldering the responsibility of caring for the baby alone, and the boyfriend's inaction exacerbates her stress. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, maybe he's stressed from school, using games as a coping mechanism. But he hasn't adjusted his behavior despite her repeated requests. The author's ultimatum is a response to his lack of change. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, threatening to leave a relationship because of ongoing issues might seem extreme, but given the context of being a new parent and the lack of support, perhaps it's a valid response. The boyfriend's actions show a disregard for her feelings and the baby's needs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have tried other methods first, like couples counseling or setting more structured boundaries. But considering she's been trying and he hasn't listened, leaving could be a reasonable choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong (B) because she's justified in standing up for her needs and the well-being of her family. The boyfriend's inaction after agreeing to change indicates he's not respecting her boundaries, which is a valid reason to end the relationship.\n"
