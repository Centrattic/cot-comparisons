My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is the asshole for threatening to leave her boyfriend because he plays too much video games. The situation involves a four-month-old daughter, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend has been playing games a lot, and the author feels neglected. They've had arguments before about this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe boyfriend agreed to stop playing too much after the last argument. Then, when the baby was crying, he went to play a game. The author felt this was disrespectful, especially since she was handling the baby alone. She told him she's done and will leave if it happens again.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's handling the baby alone all day, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up when she needs support. The fact that he ignored her previous warning might indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously. She's trying to set a boundary, which is important for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's under stress from school, and he needs some downtime. Maybe he didn't realize the impact of his actions or thought he was managing his time appropriately. He might see the author as overreacting, especially if he's trying to balance his studies.\n\nBut considering the baby's needs and the author's emotional state postpartum, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as neglectful. The author is setting a limit because she's been frustrated for a while, and this incident was the last straw. She's not just being petty; she's trying to protect her own mental health in a situation where she's already overwhelmed.\n\nThe key points are communication issues and respect. The boyfriend agreed to change before, but didn't follow through. The author is standing up for herself after repeated issues. Threatening to leave is a serious step, but given the circumstances, it's a boundary she's set after being ignored. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibility in parenting and partnership.\n\nSo, I think the author is justified in her actions. The boyfriend didn't respect her boundaries, and she's taking a stand. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
