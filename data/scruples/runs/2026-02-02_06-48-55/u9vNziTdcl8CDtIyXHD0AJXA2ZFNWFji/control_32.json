My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nSo, the author is a woman with a four-month-old daughter. Her boyfriend is in school full-time, and she's on maternity leave. They've been having issues for a couple of years about him spending too much time on video games. She feels like she's taking a backseat, and he gives her a passive-aggressive response. Since the baby was born, the problem has gotten worse. The key incident is when he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, leading to a mess and the baby crying. She confronts him, but he doesn't get why she's upset. She then tells him she's done and will leave if he does it again. He thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. The main issue is his gaming habits affecting their relationship and his responsibilities as a parent. She's the primary caregiver, handling the baby alone. He's in school, so maybe his availability is limited, but as a partner, he should be helping. The fact that he agreed before that his gaming was a problem but continued to do it after being told again suggests a pattern of not respecting her feelings. The incident where he left during the baby's feeding and she had to deal with the mess alone is a specific example of his behavior leading to her frustration.\n\nHe's supposed to be part of the parenting team. If he's not contributing and is engrossed in games, that's a problem. She's given him warnings and he hasn't changed, which makes her feel disrespected. Her ultimatum is a reaction to his continued behavior despite her clear communication. The question is whether her response is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's trying to cope with stress or has his own needs. But as a partner and parent, his actions are impacting her well-being and their child's care. The fact that he doesn't understand her anger after she explained it shows a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. She's not just being emotional; she's addressing a recurring issue that's been acknowledged but not resolved.\n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the boyfriend is not respecting her and their child's needs, and she's standing up for herself. Her decision to leave is a response to his continued neglect of their relationship and parental responsibilities. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
