My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits. \n\nFirst, the situation: They have a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about him playing video games, with her feeling neglected. After he ignores her previous warnings and plays during a time when she's handling the baby alone, she tells him she's leaving if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on their daughter and the communication between the couple. The boyfriend is supposed to be handling some responsibilities, especially since the author is dealing with the baby alone. His choice to play games when the baby is awake and needs attention seems to neglect his parental duties. The author has tried to communicate her concerns before, and he agreed, but then repeated the behavior.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary and state that she's leaving if he doesn't change. While it's tough to be in a situation where a partner isn't contributing as expected, especially with a new baby, the author is expressing her needs and limits. The boyfriend dismissing her feelings as a \"fight\" might be part of the problem, as he isn't acknowledging her valid concerns.\n\nHowever, threatening to leave after one incident might be seen as extreme. But considering the cumulative stress and his repeated disregard for her feelings, it's a decision based on self-respect and the well-being of the child. The author is prioritizing her own mental health and the family's needs over staying in a relationship where her partner isn't meeting his responsibilities.\n\nSo, balancing the communication attempts, the repeated behavior, and the impact on their child, the author's decision to set a firm boundary seems justified. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
