My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. The main issue is that the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author finds frustrating, especially since she's handling most of the baby's care alone. \n\nThe author has been arguing with him about this for a couple of years. The boyfriend has responded with things like, \"if you can find something for us to do, then I'll hang out with you,\" which makes the author feel like she's taking a backseat. After the baby was born, it's gotten worse. Recently, the boyfriend left to play a 40-minute game while the baby was eating, leading to a mess that the author had to clean up alone. The baby was crying, and he was still playing. The author told him she's done and that if he doesn't stop, she'll leave him.\n\nThe boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight, but the author argues that she had already told him five days ago that playing during the baby's sleep was okay, but other times would make her upset. He still did it, so she feels disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break down the key points. The boyfriend is in school, so maybe he's stressed and using games as a coping mechanism. However, the author is handling all the childcare, which is a lot. Communication seems to be a problem. The boyfriend's response to the arguments is dismissive, like telling her to find activities. When the author gives specific boundaries (like not playing when the baby is awake and needs attention), he doesn't respect them. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with the added stress of a newborn. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions after the agreement\u2014leaving to play while the baby was eating and then not understanding why she's upset\u2014show a lack of follow-through on his part. The author is setting a boundary and stating that she won't tolerate disrespect, which is a valid stance. The boyfriend's not respecting her feelings and the boundaries she's set could be the real issue here. \n\nIn relationships, especially with shared responsibilities like parenting, communication and respect are key. The author is trying to communicate her needs and the boyfriend isn't meeting them, leading her to feel undervalued. Ending a relationship for not respecting each other's needs isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (author isn't in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect, and the author is standing up for herself.\n"
