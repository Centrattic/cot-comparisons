My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author finds frustrating. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The author has been upset about his gaming habits for a couple of years, feeling like she's being neglected. The boyfriend has previously said things like needing the author to find activities for them to do instead of just playing games. That sounds dismissive because it shifts the responsibility to her to come up with plans, which isn't fair.\n\nAfter the baby was born, the author is even more stressed because she's handling everything alone. The boyfriend agreed a week before the incident that it's inappropriate to spend hours gaming while the author is alone with the baby. But then, in the recent incident, he leaves to play a 40-minute game while the baby is eating, which is when the baby pukes and the author has to clean up. The boyfriend is playing just 10 feet away, and the author is upset. When she tells him, he doesn't understand why she's upset and finishes his game.\n\nThe author then tells him she's done arguing and will leave next time if he does it again. She feels it's a matter of self-respect because he doesn't care about her feelings. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight.\n\nNow, to assess who's wrong. The boyfriend's actions: he agreed to stop gaming during times when the author is overwhelmed, but he breaks that agreement. His gaming is contributing to the author's stress, especially with a newborn. The fact that he didn't take her concerns seriously, even after agreeing to change, seems like a problem. The author is trying to communicate her needs and boundaries, which is valid. She's under a lot of stress with the baby and is trying to maintain a respectful relationship. Her ultimatum is a response to his repeated disregard for her feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of not understanding her anger and thinking she's picking a fight suggests he's not empathizing with her situation. His behavior is affecting their relationship and the author's well-being. The author isn't acting without cause; she's set boundaries and tried to communicate. Her decision to end the relationship if he doesn't respect her is a personal choice, but given the circumstances, it's understandable as a last resort after repeated issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend isn't respecting her needs and the agreement they made. The author is asserting herself after being patient. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
