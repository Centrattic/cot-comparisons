My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend plays a lot of video games, which the author is upset about. The author told her boyfriend that if he doesn't stop playing, she's leaving. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've been arguing about his gaming habits for a couple of years. After the baby was born, the author is taking care of the baby alone all day, and he plays games when he gets home. The last straw was when the baby puked, and the author had to clean up alone while he played. She told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author feels neglected and that her partner isn't helping with the baby. The boyfriend, on the other hand, thinks she's picking a fight. The key points here are the communication between them, the impact on their relationship, and whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author tried to talk to him before, and he agreed to change his behavior. However, he didn't follow through, which led to the incident. The author's main issue is that he doesn't respect her or their child, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The fact that he's not helping with the baby could be a problem, but maybe he's overwhelmed with school. But after being warned, he still plays games when the baby is upset. That's a red flag.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, she set a boundary and followed through when it was broken. She's standing up for herself and her needs. The boyfriend's lack of support is concerning, especially with a new child. So, the author's decision to leave if he doesn't change might be justified because she's prioritizing her well-being and her daughter's needs.\n\nBut some might argue that she's being too harsh, that the boyfriend is in school and maybe stressed, or that she should have given more chances. However, given the repeated arguments and the specific incident where he ignored her previous warning, her reaction seems reasonable. The balance here is between the couple's dynamics and the author's right to feel respected and supported.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the asshole because she's addressing a serious issue affecting their family life and her mental health. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem, and she's taking a stand for herself. So the answer should be B.\n"
