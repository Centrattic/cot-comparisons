My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is upset that her boyfriend plays too much video games, especially after their baby was born. She told him she's leaving if he doesn't stop, and now she's questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They have a four-month-old daughter. The author feels like she's taking care of the baby alone, and the boyfriend plays games even after they had an agreement. The incident in question is when the baby puked, and he left to play a game instead of helping. She told him she's done and will leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI should consider communication issues. They had previous arguments and an agreement. The boyfriend didn't follow through, leading to the breakdown. The author feels disrespected and overburdened. The key points are about respect, communication, and shared responsibilities. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to support each other. If the boyfriend isn't meeting his responsibilities, the author is justified in feeling upset. The ultimatum might be harsh, but if he's not respecting her feelings and the previous agreement, she has a right to set that boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's being unfairly accused, but given the circumstances, his actions (leaving to play games when the baby is in need) don't show consideration. The author's frustration is valid given the stress of caring for a newborn alone. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her feelings, set boundaries, and he didn't respect them. Her decision to leave if he doesn't stop is a response to his continued disregard for her and their child's needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
