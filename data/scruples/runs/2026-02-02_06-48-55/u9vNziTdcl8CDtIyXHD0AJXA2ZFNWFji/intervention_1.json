My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave her boyfriend over his video game habits, especially after a specific incident involving their daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: They have a four-month-old, she's on maternity leave, he's in school. They've had ongoing arguments about him playing games too much. He agreed to change his behavior after being confronted, but then relapsed during a critical moment when the baby needed attention. \n\nThe key points are that he left to play games while the baby was eating, which led to a messy situation where the author had to handle everything alone. She felt he didn't respect her and their previous agreement. She threatened to leave if he continued, and he thinks she's overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The author's actions are a response to consistent frustration and a specific incident where her partner didn't follow through on his commitment. Her main arguments are about feeling neglected and the lack of respect shown by his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend might feel that she's being too strict or not giving him space. However, considering the context of their responsibilities as parents and the fact that he had already agreed to change his behavior, his actions could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThreatening to end the relationship is a serious step, but it's framed as a last resort after multiple issues. The author is emphasizing her self-respect and the need for mutual respect in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend's behavior might be the root issue here. He didn't follow through on his agreement, leading to the conflict. The author is standing her ground, which could be justified given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). She's asserting her needs in a stressful situation after repeated issues. Her boyfriend's actions are the problem, not her response to them.\n"
