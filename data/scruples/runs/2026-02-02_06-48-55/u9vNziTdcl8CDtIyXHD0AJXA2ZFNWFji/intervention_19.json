My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The boyfriend plays a lot of video games, and the author feels neglected, especially with the new baby.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming. The author feels like she's taking the backseat to his games. After the baby's birth, the situation has gotten worse. The last incident was when the baby needed to eat, and he left to play a 40-minute game. The baby puked, and the author was left alone to handle the mess and the crying baby. She told him she's done and threatened to leave if he doesn't stop.\n\nThe author argues that she gave him a chance by saying it once before, and now she's had enough. The boyfriend thinks she's picking a fight. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and boundaries. The author has tried to set boundaries before, and the boyfriend didn't respect them. The situation with the baby is a big stressor. The author is handling all the baby care alone, which adds to the frustration. The boyfriend not helping and instead playing games despite being warned might be seen as neglecting his responsibilities as a partner and parent.\n\nBut, maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like, maybe a time-out or a different approach to communication. However, given the stress of a new baby and the previous attempts to address the issue, maybe her reaction is understandable. The boyfriend not understanding her upset after being told directly might indicate a lack of empathy or willingness to change.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner consistently disregards the other's feelings despite being asked, it's hard to maintain the relationship. The author is trying to set a clear boundary. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her response was proportional. Threatening to leave after multiple warnings might be a last resort, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She tried to communicate, and the boyfriend didn't adjust. Her decision to leave if he doesn't change is her right. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
