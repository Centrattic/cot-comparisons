My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the author is upset that her boyfriend is playing too much video games, especially after they have a newborn. The key points here are the context provided and the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, they have a four-month-old daughter, which means they're dealing with a lot of stress and lack of sleep. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. So she's probably handling a lot of the baby duties alone. The boyfriend's gaming habits have been a point of contention for years, but since the baby was born, it's gotten worse. \n\nThe author mentions that they had a previous discussion where he agreed not to play during certain times. However, he goes ahead and plays when the baby is awake and in need, leading to the incident where she gets upset. She confronts him, and he doesn't seem to understand her frustration. Then she tells him she's done and will leave if he keeps doing this.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend agreed to cut back, but he didn't follow through. The author feels disrespected and overworked. She's trying to communicate her needs and boundaries. She's not just being petty; she's dealing with real stress and lack of support. The boyfriend's response suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels he's under pressure from school and uses gaming as a coping mechanism. But given the circumstances, especially with a newborn, the author is justified in feeling that her partner isn't supporting her. The fact that he agreed to the previous agreement and then broke it shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. The author's reaction\u2014telling him she's done and will leave if it continues\u2014is a reasonable response to his ongoing disregard for her emotional needs and their child's care.\n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. The boyfriend's actions and lack of understanding are the main issues. The author is setting a boundary, which is necessary in a relationship, especially under such stress. So the answer should be B.\n"
