My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we\u2019ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I\u2019ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, \u201cwell if you can find something for us to do then I\u2019ll hang out with you but if not then I\u2019m going to play.\u201d  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I\u2019ve been getting more upset about this. It\u2019s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I\u2019m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn\u2019t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m picking a fight. I\u2019m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that\u2019s fine but other than that it\u2019s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn\u2019t care, or doesn\u2019t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a four-month-old daughter. The author is saying that her boyfriend spends too much time playing video games, which is causing her frustration. She told him she'd leave if he doesn't stop, and now she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend is in school full-time, and the author is on maternity leave. They've had ongoing arguments about his gaming. The trigger incident was when he left to play a game while the baby was crying, and she felt all alone dealing with the mess and the baby.\n\nThe author is justified in feeling overwhelmed, especially with a new baby. It's common for new parents to feel stressed, and support from a partner is crucial. The boyfriend's response to the previous argument was an agreement, but he didn't follow through. This shows a lack of action on his part, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is a bit harsh, but considering the context of her stress and the lack of improvement from her partner, it's understandable. She's been trying to communicate her needs, and he's not respecting them. The boyfriend dismissing her feelings as a \"fight\" doesn't help. He should acknowledge her concerns and work on changing his behavior.\n\nHowever, setting a boundary that you'll leave if things don't change is a personal choice. While it's a strong move, it's her right to decide what's acceptable in her relationship. The boyfriend's actions have led her to this point, so she's acting based on her needs. Whether she's wrong depends on perspective. If he's not willing to adjust despite knowing the impact, her decision isn't unreasonable.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe there's more to her partner's situation. He's in school, which is demanding. Perhaps he's using games as a coping mechanism. But the author's feelings are valid, and she's the primary caregiver here. Her needs shouldn't be secondary just because he's dealing with school stress.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the asshole. The boyfriend's lack of action and disregard for her feelings over time justify her decision. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
