We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The main points are that she had medical issues, he found out she was sending nudes to someone she was supposed to have blocked, and he broke up with her during her hospital stay. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The girlfriend is in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time. Cheating, even if it's sending nudes, is a major issue. The author discovered this through her phone, which he had the passcode for. But opening her WhatsApp without her knowledge might be a privacy issue. However, if she gave him the passcode multiple times, maybe he had the right to use it? Or does that still mean he shouldn't have checked her messages?\n\nThen, the breakup timing: she's already dealing with health problems, and he's adding emotional stress. Even if she cheated, breaking up during a hospitalization might be seen as inconsiderate. The author was upset and couldn't fake being okay, which is understandable. But was it necessary to end it in that moment?\n\nThe girlfriend admitted she doesn't know why she did it, which might indicate she's not being confrontational. The author's dad was there, so he wasn't leaving her alone. But the emotional impact of a breakup during such a stressful time is significant. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is a dealbreaker. On the other, the timing and method of the breakup during her hospital stay could be harsh. The author might be criticized for invading her privacy by checking WhatsApp, even if he had the passcode. Was it a breach of trust just to check?\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong in terms of the method (privacy breach) and the timing (breaking up during hospitalization). However, the cheating is a valid reason. The answer might depend on cultural or personal morals. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the timing and privacy, the answer might be A (Yes), but some might argue B (No) because of the cheating. \n\nBut the key points: opening her messages without her explicitly allowing it, even with the passcode, and breaking up during her medical crisis. So the author is in the wrong for those actions, even if the reason for the breakup is valid.\n"
