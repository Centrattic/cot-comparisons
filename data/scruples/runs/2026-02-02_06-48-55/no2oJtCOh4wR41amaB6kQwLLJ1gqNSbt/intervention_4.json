We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend having health issues, being in the hospital, and the boyfriend discovering she was sending nudes to someone else through WhatsApp when they don't use that app. He found out by checking her phone using her passcode, which he had. He broke up with her after confronting her, and now he's questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the infidelity or betrayal aspect. She was sending nudes to someone she had previously blocked for being too flirty. The boyfriend found out during a critical time when she was in the hospital. Now, the main issue is whether breaking up during her hospitalization is the right move.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend found out about her sending nudes while she was already stressed and in the hospital. He might feel that the trust was broken, and the relationship was over. However, breaking up someone during a vulnerable time like a hospital stay adds to her stress and emotional burden. It's possible she needs support, not a breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, if the cheating or betrayal was something the boyfriend couldn't handle, then ending the relationship is his right. But doing so in such a sensitive moment might be seen as insensitive. The method of confrontation\u2014discovering the infidelity by checking her phone without her knowledge\u2014is also a point of contention. Even if she gave him her passcode, using that access to check her WhatsApp could be seen as a privacy violation unless it was mutual agreement.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions led to him leaving after sobbing and apologizing to her dad. The girlfriend's response was that she didn't know why she did it, which might indicate she's in denial or not fully grasping the consequences. The boyfriend's decision to break up was immediate and during her hospitalization, which could be seen as cruel regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, considering the timing and the method of discovery, the author might be in the wrong for adding emotional distress during a time when his partner was already unwell. Even if the infidelity was grounds for a breakup, the timing and manner in which he did it might be considered inconsiderate. However, the infidelity itself is a valid reason for ending the relationship. The question is whether the timing made it wrong. If the author had waited until she was out of the hospital and in a better state to handle the breakup, that might have been more compassionate. But given the situation, the author's feelings of betrayal could justify the decision, even if the timing was poor.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because discovering cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the way and timing of the breakup could be seen as inconsiderate, making him partially at fault. The final judgment depends on balancing the severity of the betrayal against the compassion for her medical situation.\n"
