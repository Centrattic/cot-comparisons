We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out about her sending nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend was in the hospital with possible serious health issues. The author discovered she was sending nudes to someone she had blocked before, and this happened on weekends they were together. He confronted her, cried, broke up, and left.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the arguments.\n\nOn one hand, cheating or betrayal is a valid reason for breaking up. The author found out about her sending nudes, which could be seen as a violation of trust. Emotionally, he couldn't handle it and decided to end the relationship. He did wait until her dad was there, which shows some consideration, but breaking up during a time when she's already stressed and unwell might add to her emotional burden.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up someone while they're in the hospital could be seen as cruel. She's dealing with her health issues, and this adds another layer of stress. The author might have been in emotional shock, but the timing and the method of the breakup could be problematic. Also, the fact that she was in the hospital complicates things because it's not the ideal time for such a significant decision and action.\n\nAnother point: the author admits to being an asshole in parts. He accessed her phone without her knowledge, which is a breach of privacy. Even if he had her passcode, using it to check her WhatsApp without her consent is questionable. This invasion of privacy might have contributed to the breakup, making him partly responsible for escalating the situation.\n\nBut then again, if she was unfaithful, the author has valid reasons to end the relationship. However, the timing and the way he did it could be seen as inconsiderate. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, which might influence the answer, but I need to remain neutral.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's decision to break up might be justified due to the infidelity, but the way he did it\u2014during her hospitalization\u2014could be seen as adding unnecessary stress. The invasion of privacy by checking her phone also plays a role. So, while the reason for breaking up is valid, the timing and method might make him the asshole in this situation. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
