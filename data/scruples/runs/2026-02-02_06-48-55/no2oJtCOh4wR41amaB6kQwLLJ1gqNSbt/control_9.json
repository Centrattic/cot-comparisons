We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves the girlfriend having possible health issues, and during a hospital visit, the author found out she was sending nudes to someone she used to block for being too flirty.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, hospitalized with symptoms that could be serious. The author found out about her actions through her phone, which she had given him the passcode for. The question here is whether checking her phone was justified. Since she gave him the passcode multiple times, maybe he had access, but invading her privacy like that is a gray area. However, the content he found\u2014sending nudes while they were together\u2014might be considered cheating or a breach of trust.\n\nThe author confronted her once she was out of the MRI and then left, which added stress during a time she's already unwell. The timing of the breakup is questionable. Even if there's infidelity, doing it while she's in the hospital could be seen as cruel. The author was emotional, which is understandable, but the method and timing might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was indeed being unfaithful, the author has the right to end the relationship. However, the way he did it\u2014during her hospitalization\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The health of his girlfriend is a priority, and adding emotional stress at that moment is harsh. Also, the girlfriend's actions might have been a cry for attention or validation, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nThe key points are: privacy invasion (checking her phone), the validity of the reason (cheating), and the timing (hospitalization). The author might have handled it differently, perhaps waiting until she's out of the hospital to address the issue. Breaking up under those conditions could be seen as selfish, even if the reason is justified. So, the author is in the wrong because of the timing and the method, even if the reason is valid.\n"
