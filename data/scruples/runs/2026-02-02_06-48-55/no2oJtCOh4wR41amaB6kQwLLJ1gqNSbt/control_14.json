We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for almost 3 years. The girlfriend ended up in the hospital with symptoms that led to tests. The author was there supporting her, staying overnight. During the time, he found out she was sending nudes to someone she was previously blocking for being too flirty. This happened on weekends they were together. The author then broke up with her while she was in the hospital, which is the main point of contention.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and the timing of the breakup. Cheating or betrayal is a major issue in relationships. If she was indeed sending nudes to another guy while in a committed relationship, that's a breach of trust. However, the author found out about it while she was in the hospital, which is a stressful time for her. Breaking up at that moment might add to her stress and could be seen as insensitive, even if the reason is valid.\n\nThe author might argue that the betrayal was a deal-breaker and he couldn't fake it anymore. On the other hand, some might say that even in a situation of betrayal, the timing is poor because she's already dealing with health issues. The question is whether the author's actions, while understandable due to the betrayal, are inconsiderate given the circumstances.\n\nThe author didn't confront her immediately but waited until her dad was there, which shows some consideration. However, leaving her during such a vulnerable time could be seen as harsh. The answer might hinge on whether the betrayal justifies the breakup and the timing. In many cases, people might agree that cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, but the timing is questionable. However, the author might not be the asshole if the reason is valid, but others might still think it's inconsiderate. So, the answer is a bit tricky, but leaning towards B (No), because the infidelity is a significant issue, and the author had the right to end the relationship, even if the timing was tough.\n"
