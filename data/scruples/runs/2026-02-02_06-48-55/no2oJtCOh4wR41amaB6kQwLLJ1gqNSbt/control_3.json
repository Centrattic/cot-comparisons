We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves the girlfriend having health issues, leading to a hospital stay. The author discovered she sent nudes to another guy, which led him to break up, even though she was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had a medical emergency, which is a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity, which is a significant breach of trust. The key points here are the timing of the breakup during her hospitalization and whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, breaking up during such a vulnerable time could add emotional stress to her physical health issues. Hospitals are supposed to be places for care and support, and leaving someone there can be seen as harsh. The author's decision might be perceived as abandoning her in a critical moment.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of infidelity is a major reason many people end relationships. The author discovered this through checking her phone, which might raise questions about privacy invasion. However, the question is whether breaking up was wrong. The author felt the betrayal was too much and couldn't fake it anymore. The fact that the girlfriend had been unfaithful over weekends they were together adds to the betrayal.\n\nThe author did try to handle it with some care: waiting until her dad was there, not confronting her in front of hospital staff, and apologizing to her dad. But the timing of the breakup during her hospital stay is still a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the answer might depend on societal norms. Some might say that the infidelity is the greater wrong, making the breakup justified. Others might argue that the author was inconsiderate by not choosing a better time. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The girlfriend's actions were the cause, but the method of handling it could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's actions led to immediate emotional stress for the girlfriend. Even if the breakup is justified, doing it while she's in the hospital could be seen as insensitive. However, the act of breaking up over infidelity is generally acceptable. The main issue here is the timing and the method. The author was in a stressful situation and acted on his feelings, but the context of her being in the hospital complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the timing, even though the infidelity is a valid reason for breaking up. The added stress during her hospitalization could be seen as insensitive. But there's a counterargument that the betrayal justifies the breakup regardless of timing. However, since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because breaking up during her hospital stay caused her unnecessary emotional distress during a vulnerable time.\n"
