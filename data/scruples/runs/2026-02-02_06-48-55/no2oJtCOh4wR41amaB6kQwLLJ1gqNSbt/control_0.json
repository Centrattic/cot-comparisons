We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. Let's start by looking at the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the author discovered that his girlfriend had been sending nudes to an ex she had blocked for being too flirty, even when they were together. That's a serious breach of trust. Cheating, or at least emotional infidelity, can be a deal-breaker for many people. The fact that she was doing this during weekends they were together makes it even worse because it shows a lack of consideration for their relationship. \n\nHowever, breaking up while she's in the hospital for a possible serious medical issue adds another layer. Hospitalization can be stressful and vulnerable for someone. The author did wait until she was settled back in her room and had her dad there, which might show some consideration. But breaking up during such a time might add unnecessary emotional stress on top of her physical health concerns. \n\nNow, the author's actions\u2014opening her phone and discovering the messages\u2014could be a point of contention. Even if she gave him her passcode, checking her WhatsApp without consent might be seen as invading her privacy. That could be a reason for conflict. However, the content he found was a breach of trust, which justifies his reaction.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up under these circumstances is justified. If the cheating was a deal-breaker for the author, then breaking up isn't the wrong choice. However, the timing of breaking up during her hospitalization could be seen as insensitive. But the author did it to avoid lying to her, which is a valid reason for some people.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were definitely wrong. She was unfaithful and didn't consider the impact of her actions. The author's decision to break up is a response to her betrayal, which might be justified. However, the method and timing might affect whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of the question, the key is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up. Since cheating is a major issue, and the author chose to confront her respectfully (without yelling, crying) and then left, it's more about the timing. But considering the severity of the infidelity, the breakup itself isn't necessarily the wrong move. The wrongness would depend on whether breaking up during her hospitalization is seen as adding insult to injury. However, the author did it to be honest and not fake it, which is a valid perspective. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author is not in the wrong because the infidelity is a significant reason to end the relationship, even if the timing was tough. The answer is B.\n"
