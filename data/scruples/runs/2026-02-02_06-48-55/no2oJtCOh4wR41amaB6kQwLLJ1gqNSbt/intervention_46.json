We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a boyfriend who breaks up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. She had symptoms like dizziness and weakness and was admitted. He was with her after work, then during the night, when he was holding her phone, he found WhatsApp messages where she sent nudes to an ex she blocked for being too flirty. The ex messages were on weekends when they were together.\n\nThe key points here are: Did he have the right to check her phone? Did the infidelity actually happen? And was breaking up in the hospital appropriate?\n\nFirst, checking her phone. She gave him her passcode multiple times, and he used it to open the phone. But does that mean he had the right to look into her WhatsApp? Even though she gave the passcode for practical reasons, like unlocking it, that doesn't necessarily give permission to snoop. Privacy is important in relationships, and accessing her private messages without her knowledge is a breach of trust. So maybe he overstepped there.\n\nThen, the act of sending nudes. If they were not using WhatsApp, maybe it wasn't a big deal, but he found out through her phone. The ex was someone she blocked for being flirty, so reconnecting with him and sending explicit photos could be considered cheating. The question is, was that a valid reason to break up? If there's a no-strings-attached arrangement or if it's mutual, maybe, but the context suggests she was in a committed relationship. So maybe the infidelity is a legitimate issue.\n\nBut the timing of the breakup is during a time when she's already stressed and in the hospital. That adds a layer of insensitivity. Breaking up while someone is unwell might be seen as cruel, even if the reason is valid. He might have wanted to wait until she was in a better condition to handle the emotional fallout. Also, confronting her on the MRI day when she's vulnerable and then leaving could add to her stress. The hospital is a high-stress environment, and maybe this isn't the best time for such news.\n\nThe author also mentions he \"waited until her dad was there\" to confront her, which might be a consideration, but the act itself is still happening in a hospital. His dad was there to support her, so involving him in the breakup might not have been the best approach. Also, the girlfriend's response was that she doesn't know why she did it, which could indicate some deeper issues, but the author chose to end the relationship immediately.\n\nIn terms of validity, if the girlfriend was indeed in a committed relationship and sent explicit photos to another man, that's typically considered a breach of trust. However, the method of discovering it (without her knowing) and the timing (hospital) are problematic. The author's actions show a lack of respect for her privacy and added stress during a vulnerable time. Even if he felt wronged, the way he handled it might be the wrong approach. So, while her actions might be the reason for the breakup, the author's method could be seen as the asshole part here. He should have trusted her and maybe confronted her when the situation was less critical. The fact that he couldn't \"fake it\" is his own emotional reaction, but it doesn't excuse breaking up in the hospital. So I think the author is in the wrong because of the privacy breach and the inconsiderate timing, even if the infidelity is real. The answer would be A.\n"
