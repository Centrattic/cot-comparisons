We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating three years. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with symptoms that could be serious. The guy is there with her, taking care of her. Then he checks her phone, finds out she's been sending nudes to someone else she was blocking before. He confronts her and breaks up, leaving her during this stressful time.\n\nSo, the main issues here. The guy went through her phone without consent? Wait, she gave him her passcode multiple times. But does that mean he's allowed to check her messages? Even if she gave the passcode, opening WhatsApp and looking into private messages might be a privacy violation. That's a big red flag.\n\nThen, breaking up while she's in the hospital. She's already stressed about her health, and now this adds emotional trauma. Timing-wise, it's not ideal. Even if he found out about the cheating, doing it in the hospital might be cruel. But wait, maybe he couldn't handle the stress anymore and needed to leave. But is that an excuse?\n\nAlso, the fact that she was sending nudes while they were together on weekends\u2014that's definitely cheating. But the way he handled it: confronting her in the hospital, then leaving her there. He did wait until her dad was there, which is good, but still, breaking up during such a vulnerable time is questionable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, AITA? Well, the guy did find out about the infidelity, which is a valid reason to break up. But the method of finding out\u2014checking her phone without explicit consent\u2014might be his fault. Even if she gave the passcode, it's about the intent. Also, the timing of the breakup adds stress during her hospitalization.\n\nSo, considering both sides: he's upset because of the cheating, which is valid, but his actions (checking phone, breaking up in the hospital) could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a tough call. But maybe he's not entirely in the wrong because the cheating is a major issue. However, the way he handled it is problematic. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of privacy violation and bad timing, but others might say B because the cheating justifies the breakup. But I think overall, the method is the main issue here, making him the asshole.\n"
