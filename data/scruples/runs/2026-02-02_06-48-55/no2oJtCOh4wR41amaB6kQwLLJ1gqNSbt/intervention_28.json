We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she sent nudes to an ex. The situation is complicated, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was admitted for possible serious health issues, which is a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity or at least some form of betrayal. The question is whether breaking up during this time is justified or if the author is being an asshole. \n\nThe author's actions: They waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which seems considerate not to leave her alone. They cried and asked why, then left. The girlfriend was sending nudes on weekends they were together, so it's a clear breach of trust. The author didn't confront her in a hospital setting during the MRI but waited until she was back in her room and her dad was present. \n\nIs it wrong to break up during her hospitalization? Well, it's a tough decision. On one hand, finding out about such a betrayal might be too much to handle emotionally, and they couldn't fake it. On the other, the timing is during her vulnerable moment. But the author did take steps to minimize her isolation by getting her dad involved. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior was dishonest. She gave the author her phone with the passcode, which implies some level of trust, and then used a different platform to send nudes. That's a breach of trust, which is a valid reason for a breakup. However, the method of discovery\u2014checking her phone without explicit permission\u2014might be an issue. But the girlfriend handed it over, so maybe the author was within their right to look through it. \n\nThe key points are the breach of trust and the timing. If the author truly couldn't handle the relationship after finding out about the infidelity, then breaking up is understandable. However, doing so during her hospitalization could add unnecessary stress. But the author did wait until she was stable and her dad was there. \n\nSo, in this case, the author had a valid reason for the breakup (cheating), and took steps to support her by involving her dad. The question is whether the timing makes the action wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after considering the betrayal, maybe the author isn't. The answer would depend on whether the other person is considered in the wrong. Since the girlfriend was cheating, the author's decision might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
