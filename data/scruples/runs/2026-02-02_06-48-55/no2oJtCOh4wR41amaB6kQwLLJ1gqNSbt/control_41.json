We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation is that he found out she was sending nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, even though they weren't using that app to communicate. He broke up with her after discovering this, and he's questioning if he was right to do so under the circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend was in the hospital with potential health issues, which adds stress and vulnerability. The author found out about her infidelity or at least inappropriate behavior through her phone, which she gave him the passcode for. He confronted her and then broke up, which caused her additional stress.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he was wrong. On one hand, cheating or seeking validation through another person is a betrayal, and it's reasonable for someone to end a relationship because of that. The fact that she sent nudes while they were together on weekends could be seen as a major breach of trust. On the other hand, he broke up with her while she was already in a stressful situation, which could add to her emotional burden. The method of breaking up\u2014doing so in the hospital\u2014might be seen as insensitive, especially when she's already dealing with her health issues.\n\nBut then, the author tried to handle it calmly, waited until her dad was there for support, and apologized for involving her dad. He also didn't yell but cried, which shows he was emotional but not confrontational. The key here is whether the timing and the manner of the breakup were wrong. Breaking up during a time when the partner is already unwell could be seen as adding to her stress. However, the act of ending a relationship due to a breach of trust is often considered justified.\n\nAnother angle is her actions. She reconnected with a guy she blocked for being too flirty and sent nudes. If this is confirmed as cheating or at least emotionally unfaithful, then the author has grounds to end the relationship. The fact that she couldn't explain why she did it might indicate a lack of accountability, which could further justify his decision.\n\nBut the question is whether he was wrong. The stress of being in the hospital and then a breakup could be harmful, but if the relationship was already broken due to her actions, then ending it might be necessary for his well-being. The ethical dilemma here is balancing personal boundaries and the timing of a breakup. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say it's harsh to break up during such a vulnerable time, while others might support standing up for oneself when trust is broken. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format often looks at both sides, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a reaction to betrayal. While the timing was tough, the decision to end the relationship because of cheating is generally seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not the asshole), but there's a nuance because of the timing. However, the primary issue here is her actions, not his. So the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship due to her infidelity, even if it was during her hospital stay.\n"
