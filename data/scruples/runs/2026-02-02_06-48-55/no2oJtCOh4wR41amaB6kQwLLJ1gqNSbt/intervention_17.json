We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out she was sending nudes to another guy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend had a medical emergency and was in the hospital. The author found out she was sending explicit photos to someone she had previously blocked for being too flirty, even while they were together. He broke up with her right there, which added stress during her hospital stay.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Cheating is a serious issue, and the author felt betrayed. However, breaking up someone while they're in the hospital might be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's health is a priority, and adding emotional stress could harm her recovery. But the author might argue that he couldn't fake being okay anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were dishonest. She was sending nudes to another guy during the relationship, which is a violation of trust. The author had every right to feel hurt and decide to end the relationship. But doing so while she's vulnerable and in a hospital setting raises questions about timing and compassion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he discovered infidelity, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the context is a hospital, which is a stressful time. The question is whether he was inconsiderate by breaking up then. But if the relationship was already over due to her actions, maybe he had to confront it immediately.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer might depend on perspective. Some might say he handled it poorly by not being there for her during her medical crisis. Others might support him for not faking it and ending a broken relationship. \n\nI need to weigh the seriousness of cheating against the timing. Since she was in the hospital, maybe he should have waited until she was stable. But he was already there, and he couldn't fake being okay. It's a tough call. But in terms of right or wrong, the cheating is a major issue, so the breakup might be justified. However, the way it was handled could be seen as harsh. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the hospital setting, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
