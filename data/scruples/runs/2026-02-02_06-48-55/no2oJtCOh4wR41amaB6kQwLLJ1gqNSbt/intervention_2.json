We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to an ex, which he considered cheating. But he did some questionable things himself, like checking her phone without her permission.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time. Breaking up during such a stressful period could add more stress. People might argue that it's not the right time to end a relationship, even if there's a valid reason. But on the other hand, if he found out about the cheating, he might not want to fake it anymore.\n\nHe admitted to being an asshole in parts. He accessed her WhatsApp without her knowledge, even though she gave him her passcode. That's a problem because even if she shared her passcode, opening her private messages without consent is a breach of trust. That's a significant issue because privacy is important in relationships. His actions could be seen as a violation of her privacy, which might make the breakup more complicated.\n\nHe confronted her after she was done with her MRI, which is already a stressful time for her. Even if he was upset, doing it in the hospital might not be the best approach. Also, he left her after the breakup, so she had to deal with the emotional fallout alone. That could be seen as insensitive.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend was indeed sending nudes to another guy while in a relationship, which is a form of cheating. That's a valid reason to break up. The problem is how he handled it. Breaking up someone when they're in the hospital and under medical stress is harsh, even if the reason is justified. The method of handling it\u2014using her hospital stay as the time to confront and leave\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the debate is between the validity of the reason (cheating) versus the timing and method (hospital setting, privacy breach). If the author had waited until she was out of the hospital and in a better place physically, maybe it would have been more considerate. But he had a legitimate reason to break up. However, his actions in checking her phone without consent and the timing of the breakup might make him partially at fault.\n\nI think the main issue is the violation of privacy. Even if the reason is justified, the way he discovered the information (without her consent) is a major problem. Plus, breaking up during her hospital stay adds to the stress. The author's actions might have been necessary for him to move on, but the method was flawed. So, he's partly in the wrong. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted because cheating is a valid reason. But the AITA context often leans towards considering the method and sensitivity. So, probably A.\n"
