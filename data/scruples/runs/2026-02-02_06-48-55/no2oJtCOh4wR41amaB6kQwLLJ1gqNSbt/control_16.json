We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The main points from the story are that the girlfriend was in the hospital with possible health issues\u2014dizziness, weakness in arm and leg, which could be serious. The author found out through her phone that she was sending nudes to someone she had blocked for being too flirty, even while they were together. He waited until her dad was there before confronting her and then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in the hospital, which is already a stressful time. Breaking up during such a vulnerable moment could add to her stress. However, the author discovered infidelity or at least cheating behavior, which is a major betrayal. The girlfriend was sending nudes to another guy, which is a breach of trust. The author might feel justified in ending the relationship because of that.\n\nBut then, the timing is questionable. She's already in the hospital with possible serious health issues. Ending the relationship at that moment could be seen as cruel, as it adds emotional distress to her physical stress. However, the author might not have been able to handle the betrayal any longer and couldn't fake it anymore. The question is whether the betrayal is a sufficient reason to break up, even in such circumstances.\n\nEthically, people might argue that the author is in the right because cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. On the other hand, the method of breaking up\u2014during a hospital stay\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author did wait until her dad was present, which shows some consideration for her not being alone. He also apologized for making her dad leave, so he tried to be considerate.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to open her phone in the first place. She gave him the passcode multiple times, but accessing her WhatsApp without her consent might be a privacy violation. However, since she gave him the phone to hold while she was in the MRI, maybe he thought it was okay to check it. Still, accessing private messages without permission is generally considered a breach of privacy, which complicates the situation. If he had no right to look into her phone, then his actions in finding the messages might be his fault, which would make the breakup less justified.\n\nBut if she gave him the phone and the passcode, maybe he thought he had permission. It's a bit ambiguous. However, even if he did have access, the content of the messages is private. So opening WhatsApp and reading her messages might be crossing a line. If that's the case, then the author's initial action of checking her phone without her consent is where he's at fault. The breakup itself might be a reaction to something that he shouldn't have known about in the first place.\n\nBut assuming that the author had the right to check her phone (since she gave him the phone and the passcode), then the cheating is valid, and the breakup is justified. However, the timing of the breakup during her hospital stay is still questionable. Some might argue that it's selfish to end the relationship while she's already going through health issues, but others might say that the betrayal is more significant.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks at intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to end the relationship due to betrayal, which is understandable. The consequence is adding stress to his girlfriend during a difficult time. However, the betrayal itself is a major issue. The author did confront her calmly and tried to be considerate by having her dad there. The fact that he left sobbing and apologized for involving her dad shows remorse and consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of reading her phone without explicit permission (even if she gave the passcode) could be seen as a violation of privacy. If the author had confronted her earlier when he found out, but he waited until the hospital. So the key factors are: 1) Did the author have the right to check her phone? 2) Was the timing of the breakup inconsiderate?\n\nIf the answer to 1 is yes (he didn't have the right), then he's at fault for the initial privacy violation, making the breakup less justified. If he did have the right, then the breakup is a reaction to cheating, which is valid, but the timing is still questionable. However, since the cheating was ongoing during their time together, it's a serious issue. So the author might not be the asshole because the cheating was significant enough to warrant a breakup, even if the timing was tough.\n\nBut some might argue that breaking up someone in the hospital is unnecessarily harsh, regardless of the reason. However, the author couldn't fake being okay with the cheating, so he couldn't stay. The community might split here. The AITA subreddit often considers the validity of the reason for the action. Since cheating is a common reason for breakups, and the author did try to be considerate (by having her dad there, not yelling, etc.), he might not be the asshole. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, the privacy aspect complicates it. If he shouldn't have checked her phone, then he is at fault. If he did have the right, then he's not.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether breaking up during her hospital stay is wrong. The author's actions were based on discovering cheating, which is a valid reason. However, the method and timing might be seen as insensitive. But in the AITA context, the subreddit often sides with people who end relationships due to cheating, even if the timing is bad. So the answer might be B.\n"
