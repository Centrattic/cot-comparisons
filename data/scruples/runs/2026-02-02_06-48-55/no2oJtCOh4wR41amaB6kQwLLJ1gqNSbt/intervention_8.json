We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend was in the hospital with symptoms that could be serious, and the author found out she was cheating via WhatsApp messages. He broke up with her on the spot, which added stress to her hospital stay.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Cheating is a major betrayal in most relationships. If the author felt that this cheating was a deal-breaker, then breaking up might be justified. However, doing so while she's in the hospital, in a vulnerable state, could be seen as insensitive. Timing is a big factor here. It's one thing to end a relationship due to betrayal, but doing it in the middle of her medical crisis might be cruel, even if the betrayal was real.\n\nAlso, the author admitted he's not entirely in the right because he snooped through her phone. Privacy is important, and invading that could be a breach of trust on his part. Even if he found something, the method of discovery might affect his moral standing here.\n\nBut then again, the cheating is a serious issue. People have different thresholds for infidelity, and some might see breaking up as a justified response. However, the author's choice to end the relationship in the hospital might not be the most compassionate approach, especially when she's already under stress from her health issues.\n\nSo, weighing the two: the cheating is a valid reason, but the timing and method of the breakup might make the author the asshole. The act of snooping also plays a role. So, the answer might be A (Author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
