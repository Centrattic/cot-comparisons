We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The reason was that he found out she was sending nudes to someone else on weekends they were together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital with possible health issues (dizziness, weakness in arm and leg, which could be serious). The author found out about her infidelity or at least her sending nudes to someone else. But he found out by looking through her phone when she gave him the phone to hold. She had given him the passcode multiple times, so maybe he had access. But was it right for him to check her WhatsApp without her permission? That's a big question. Even if she gave him the passcode, checking private messages might be a breach of trust.\n\nThen, breaking up while she's in the hospital. That's a sensitive time. She's already stressed and unwell. Ending the relationship in that moment could add more emotional distress. The author says he waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, which is a good move, but the timing is still questionable. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions (sending nudes to someone else) could be considered a betrayal. But the author's method of finding out (checking her phone without asking) is problematic. Also, the way he confronted her while she was in the hospital might be seen as harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author had every right to be upset about her infidelity. On the other, the method of finding out and the timing of the breakup could be seen as unkind. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He broke up with her because of her actions, which might be valid, but the way he discovered it and the timing of the breakup could be seen as exacerbating her situation. The fact that he checked her phone without her consent first is a breach of privacy. Then, breaking up during her hospitalization adds stress. So maybe he's part at fault for the method. However, the infidelity is a significant issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to decide. If the main issue is the breakup during her hospital stay, maybe that's the key point. Even if he found out about her cheating, doing it while she's in the hospital is unkind. Also, the method of discovering it by checking her phone without her consent. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the timing and the breach of privacy in finding out. But maybe not, because the infidelity is a valid reason for breaking up. It's a tough one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he had a valid reason to break up, even if the timing is bad. But the act of checking her phone without her permission is another issue. So maybe he's partly in the wrong for that. But the main question is about the breakup. \n\nI think the key point is that breaking up during her hospitalization is unkind, so he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
