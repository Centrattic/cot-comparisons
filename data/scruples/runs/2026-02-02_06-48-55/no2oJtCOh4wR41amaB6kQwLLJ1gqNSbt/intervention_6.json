We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to another guy. Let me unpack this.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together three years. Girlfriend has a medical issue, admitted to the hospital. The author finds out via her phone that she was sending nudes to someone she blocked for being too flirty. He breaks up with her while she's in the hospital, which adds to her stress.\n\nSo the key points here. The author found out about the cheating or at least the inappropriate communication. But did he have the right to break up with her while she's in the hospital? That's the crux. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as a betrayal. If she was sending nudes when they were even together on weekends, that's a major trust issue. The author felt the need to confront her and break up because he couldn't fake it anymore. He also made sure she was safe by getting her dad there first. But doing this during her hospitalization might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut on the other hand, breaking up during a time when she's already stressed about her health could be adding to her emotional burden. She's in the hospital, dealing with possible medical issues, and now this. The author might think he's being honest, but timing is crucial. Maybe he should have waited until she was in a better position to handle the emotional stress.\n\nAlso, the fact that he found her phone and looked through WhatsApp without her knowing\u2014though she gave him her passcode multiple times, does that make it okay? If she gave him the passcode willingly, maybe he had some right to access her phone, but invading privacy in that way could be questionable. But the context is that he found out about the messages, which were clearly cheating-related. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was just repeating that she doesn't know why she did it. That might be a red flag about her maturity or commitment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up someone when they're in the hospital could be seen as cruel, but the reason for the breakup is significant. If the cheating was real, then maybe he had a valid reason. However, the timing and the method might be the issue. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is right to end a relationship based on betrayal. But the way he did it\u2014during her hospitalization\u2014might be seen as adding insult to injury. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the timing, even though the reason is valid. Or B (not in the wrong) because the cheating is a legitimate reason to break up, regardless of when it happens.\n\nI think it's a tricky call. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. If the cheating is a deal-breaker, then the breakup is justified. However, the method of delivering it during a health crisis is questionable. The answer depends on whether the timing made it worse. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for both the reason and the approach. The author might be the asshole for the method even if the reason is valid.\n"
