We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend was in the hospital for a possible serious health issue, like a stroke or something, given her symptoms. The author discovered through her WhatsApp that she had been sending nudes to someone she previously blocked for being too flirty. They were together for three years, and this happened on weekends they were together, which suggests cheating.\n\nThe author broke up with her while she was in the hospital, which could add to her stress. He did wait until her father was there before confronting her, which is a bit considerate. But breaking up during a medical crisis might be seen as harsh. \n\nHowever, cheating is a major betrayal. If the girlfriend was indeed having an emotional and physical affair, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author felt hurt and couldn't fake it anymore. On the other hand, timing is important. She's dealing with her health, and the breakup might complicate her recovery emotionally.\n\nBut the key points here are: 1) Did she cheat? If she was sending nudes to someone else while in a committed relationship, that's infidelity. 2) Was the breakup justified? Cheating is a common reason to break up. 3) Was the timing inconsiderate? It's unkind to add stress during a health crisis, but the author might feel he couldn't wait.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving her over cheating, but the timing is questionable. However, since the situation involves betrayal, it's a valid reason. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of the timing. But the main issue is the cheating, which is a deal-breaker for many. So the author is justified in breaking up, even if the timing isn't ideal.\n"
