We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend ended up in the hospital with symptoms like dizziness and weakness. The author went to the hospital, stayed with her, and then during an MRI, he checked her phone (since she gave him the code) and found out she was sending nudes to someone she previously blocked for being too flirty. He confronted her after the MRI and then left, breaking up via Uber. Now, the question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author act inconsiderately? He found out about her infidelity, which is a serious issue. However, breaking up while she's in the hospital adds stress to her situation. She's already dealing with health issues. But cheating is a major betrayal, so the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. However, the timing and method of the breakup are questionable. Breaking up via Uber instead of in person could be seen as cruel, especially in a hospital setting. Also, the fact that he had to rely on her dad to be there during the confrontation might indicate he didn't handle it face-to-face, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to be considerate by waiting until her dad was there. He apologized for making her dad come in. The cheating is a legitimate reason to break up, and it's understandable that he couldn't fake it anymore. However, the hospital setting complicates things. People's reactions can vary\u2014some might think he's justified in ending the relationship because of the cheating, while others might think he was inconsiderate by adding stress during her hospitalization.\n\nAnother angle: Did he have a right to check her phone? She gave him the passcode multiple times, so maybe he thought it was okay. But opening her WhatsApp without her knowledge could be a privacy violation. However, the content he found (cheating) is a serious breach of trust. It's a bit of a gray area here.\n\nIn terms of the breakup method, breaking up through a third party (her dad) without being there himself might be seen as avoiding the conversation. But he was overwhelmed and couldn't stay, so maybe it's understandable. The fact that he cried and was emotional shows he wasn't cold about it.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The answer depends on whether the timing and method of the breakup outweigh the cheating. Cheating is a valid reason to break up, but doing so in a hospital adds stress. However, the author might not be in the wrong because the cheating is the fundamental issue. The method could be debated, but the core issue is valid.\n\nBut there's also the question of privacy. Did he have the right to check her phone? If she gave him the code, maybe he thought it was okay. But using her passcode to access WhatsApp without her knowledge might be a breach of trust, though the context of finding evidence complicates it.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for breaking up because the cheating is a valid reason. However, the way he did it (leaving via Uber instead of being there) could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the circumstances, maybe the main issue is the cheating, so he's justified. So, answer B.\n"
