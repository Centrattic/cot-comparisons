We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she had been sending nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The girlfriend is in the hospital with possible serious health issues, which is already a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity through her phone and decided to break up. The question is whether he handled it the right way.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions were definitely a betrayal. Cheating, even if it's just sending nudes, is a serious breach of trust in a relationship. The author had every right to feel hurt and to want to end the relationship. However, doing so while she's in the hospital adds another layer of complexity. Timing is a big factor here. Was it necessary to confront her and break up immediately in such a vulnerable time? It might have added more stress to her when she's already going through health issues.\n\nThe author did wait until her dad was there, which shows he considered her safety and support. He didn't yell but was emotional, which is understandable. However, the act of breaking up during a medical crisis could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Some might argue that he should have waited until she was in a better situation to handle the emotional impact of a breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in emotional distress and couldn't fake being okay. It's possible he felt breaking up was the only way he could cope. Also, the girlfriend's actions were a betrayal, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship. The key point is whether the timing and method of the breakup were appropriate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often feel that ending a relationship during a partner's time of need is harsh, even if justified. But if the relationship was already broken due to infidelity, then the breakup is justified. The author's actions might be seen as the right decision for himself, even if it added stress to her situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation. However, some might argue he is in the wrong (A) because he added stress during her hospitalization. I need to weigh the betrayal against the timing.\n"
