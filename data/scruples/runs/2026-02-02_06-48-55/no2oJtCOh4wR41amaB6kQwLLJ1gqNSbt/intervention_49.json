We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe couple has been dating for almost three years. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with symptoms like dizziness and weakness, which is concerning. The author goes to the hospital after work, stays with her, and then later finds out through her phone that she's been sending nudes to another guy. He confronts her and then leaves, breaking up.\n\nSo, first, the issue is whether breaking up during a health crisis is wrong. The girlfriend is already stressed and dealing with medical tests. The author found out about the infidelity or betrayal, which is a serious issue in a relationship. But the timing is during her hospitalization.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend was sending nudes to someone she had blocked before, and she didn't know why she did it. That's confusing. The author felt hurt and couldn't fake it anymore, so he broke up. But doing so while she's in the hospital adds stress to her situation.\n\nNow, considering the ethical side: cheating is a major betrayal. If the author found out about it, it's understandable to feel like ending the relationship. However, the timing of the breakup during her hospital stay might be seen as cruel. The girlfriend is already vulnerable and dealing with her health. The author could argue that he couldn't fake being okay anymore, but others might say he should have waited until she was out of the hospital to handle the breakup.\n\nBut then again, if she was cheating, the relationship is already damaged. The author might feel that continuing the relationship under false pretenses is worse. However, causing additional stress during her hospitalization could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid.\n\nThere's also the question of privacy. The author accessed her phone without her consent, which is a problem. Even if she gave him the passcode, using it to check her WhatsApp might be a breach of trust. So maybe the author's actions in checking her phone could be another point against him.\n\nBut the main question is about the breakup timing. If the cheating is confirmed, then the breakup is justified, but the context of her being in the hospital complicates it. Some people might say that it's okay to break up for a valid reason, even if it's hard on the other person, while others might think it's inconsiderate to add to her stress during a health crisis.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reason (cheating) is valid enough to justify the breakup despite the timing. If the cheating is a legitimate deal-breaker, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the timing is unnecessarily cruel, then he is. The fact that he waited until her dad was there to be with her might show some consideration, but breaking up immediately after discovering the infidelity could be seen as impulsive.\n\nBut the author also mentions that the girlfriend was seeking validation, which might indicate emotional issues. The author might feel that the relationship is unsustainable. However, breaking up during her hospitalization could be seen as the lesser of two evils for himself but more harmful to her.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the author is in the right because cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. Others might say that the author acted selfishly by not considering her medical situation. The fact that he apologized for making her dad rush out shows some remorse, but the action itself is still the issue.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Cheating as a reason for breakup is generally accepted as valid, 2) Breaking up during a health crisis adds stress, which could be seen as inconsiderate, 3) The privacy breach by checking her phone without permission is a separate issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the timing and the privacy issue, but some might say B (not in the wrong) because cheating is a valid reason. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation, the answer depends on balancing the valid reason against the timing and method. Since the author did check her phone without consent, which is a breach of trust, and then broke up during her hospitalization, which adds stress, that could tip the scales towards him being in the wrong, making the answer A.\n"
