We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author found out that his girlfriend was sending nudes to someone else, which is a betrayal. Cheating or infidelity can be a deal-breaker for many people. But the timing is during her hospital stay, which adds a layer of stress and maybe vulnerability for her.\n\nHe mentions that she had health issues, and he was already there supporting her. He found out about the infidelity, confronted her, and then left. He also involved her dad, which might have added to her stress. The question is whether breaking up at that moment was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he's reacting to a betrayal, which is valid. On the other hand, doing it while she's in the hospital could be seen as cruel because she's already under medical stress. But if the infidelity was a major issue, some might argue that honesty and respect are more important than the timing.\n\nI wonder if the key is whether he handled it the right way. He didn't just leave immediately without confronting her, he waited until her dad was there. He also apologized for involving her dad. However, breaking up during such a critical time for her health might be seen as insensitive. \n\nAnother angle is whether the infidelity was a valid reason. If she was indeed cheating, then the breakup is justified. But if the author had the choice to handle it differently, like waiting until she's recovered, maybe that would have been better. But he says he couldn't fake it anymore, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? Some people might say yes because of the timing, others no because of the betrayal. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. However, in the context of the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, the community often considers both the validity of the action and the manner. Here, the author did confront her properly, but the timing might be seen as harsh. But the infidelity is a strong point in his favor. Maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because the infidelity is a valid reason, even if the timing is tough.\n"
