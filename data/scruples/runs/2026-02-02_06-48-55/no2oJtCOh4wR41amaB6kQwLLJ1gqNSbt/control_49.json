We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend had a medical emergency, they went to the hospital, and during an MRI, the guy checked her phone and found out she was sending nudes to an ex she blocked for being too flirty. She did this even when they were together on weekends. He breaks up with her while she's in the hospital.\n\nSo, the key points here. Is it wrong to break up with someone during a medical crisis? Well, if she's already in the hospital, maybe breaking up adds emotional stress. But on the other hand, he discovered cheating or betrayal through her WhatsApp messages. He waited until her dad was there, and then left. \n\nHe says he didn't yell, just cried and asked why. He also apologized for making her dad come over. The question is whether he was in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, breaking up over infidelity is often seen as justified. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the guy might feel he's acting in self-respect. However, doing it while she's in the hospital might be seen as cruel, because she's already vulnerable. But if the cheating is confirmed, then maybe he's not the asshole here. \n\nBut wait, the user might be considering the method of the breakup. Some might argue that he should have waited until she was healthier to break up. However, the act of breaking up itself might not be the issue if the cheating is true. \n\nAlso, the guy checked her phone without her consent. That could be a problem. If he had given her the phone and she gave him the passcode, maybe he had access. But using that access to check WhatsApp, which they don't use, might be considered a privacy violation. So maybe he's at fault for checking her phone in the first place. \n\nBut the story says she gave him the passcode multiple times because he had a bad memory. So he might have thought it was okay to open her phone when she gave it to him. But still, opening WhatsApp without her knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the content of what he found\u2014sending nudes to an ex while in a relationship\u2014is cheating. So even if he checked her phone in a way that's questionable, the reason for breaking up is valid. \n\nSo, the dilemma is between the method (checking phone, breaking up during hospitalization) versus the justification (cheating). \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is in the wrong for invading her privacy by checking her phone. Others might say that since she gave him the passcode and phone, he had a right to access it. But the act of checking WhatsApp without her knowing is a privacy issue. \n\nBut the main issue is the breakup during her hospitalization. Even if he found out about the cheating, doing it while she's in the hospital might be seen as adding insult to injury. However, if the cheating is confirmed, then the breakup is justified regardless. \n\nSo the answer might depend on whether the cheating was confirmed and the appropriateness of the timing. If the user is asking if the author is the asshole, the answer could swing either way. \n\nBut given that the author confronted her in a respectful manner, waited for her dad to be there, and the cheating was a valid reason, maybe he's not the asshole. The initial phone checking could be a point against him, but if it led to uncovering betrayal, it's a gray area. \n\nOverall, the community might split, but the main point is that the author discovered cheating, which is a legitimate reason to break up. The method of breaking up during hospitalization is harsh, but the reason is valid. So the answer might be B (not the asshole) because the cheating is the main issue.\n"
