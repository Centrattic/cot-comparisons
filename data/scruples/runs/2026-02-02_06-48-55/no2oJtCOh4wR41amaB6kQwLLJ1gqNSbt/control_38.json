We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering her infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for almost three years. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with symptoms that led to tests. The author (he) was with her, and during the MRI waiting period, he found out through her WhatsApp that she had been sending nudes to another guy over the past three months, even when they were together. He breaks up with her while she's in the hospital, confronting her and then leaving.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The girlfriend's actions (sending nudes to another guy and seeking validation) are clear breaches of trust. Cheating or engaging in infidelity is generally considered a major issue in relationships. The author's immediate reaction is to break up, which might be seen as harsh given the circumstances of her being in the hospital. However, the stress of medical issues might have affected her behavior, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nThe timing of the breakup could be problematic because she's already under stress from her health situation. Critics might argue that breaking up during such a vulnerable time adds unnecessary stress. On the other hand, the author felt he couldn't fake it anymore, and the infidelity is a significant betrayal that would affect any relationship. \n\nThe author did try to be considerate by waiting until her dad was there and apologizing for involving him. But the act of breaking up while she's in the hospital could be seen as cruel. However, the infidelity was ongoing, which is a serious issue. \n\nI need to weigh the validity of breaking up over cheating versus the timing. Cheating is usually a deal-breaker for many, but doing so during a health crisis might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn some views, the author is justified because cheating is a major betrayal, but the timing could be questioned. Others might say the timing is wrong regardless of the reason. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's actions were not malicious; he was hurt and couldn't continue the relationship. But the method of breaking up during her hospitalization might not be the best time. However, since the infidelity was discovered during that time, maybe it's unavoidable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because cheating is a valid reason to break up, even if the timing is tough. The author's actions were a response to betrayal, though the method could be seen as harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. Since cheating is a valid reason, the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue the timing. However, the main issue is the infidelity, which is a deal-breaker, so the author isn't the asshole here. So answer B.\n"
