We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out his girlfriend was sending nudes to an old flirty guy she reconnected with. They were together for almost three years, and he discovered this through her WhatsApp. He broke up with her right then, when she was in the hospital, which caused her added stress.\n\nNow, the key points. The girlfriend was already in the hospital with medical issues, and the breakup happened during a vulnerable time. The author didn't confront her in private first but instead broke up after discovering the messages. He did wait until her dad was present, though, which might show some consideration. \n\nBut the main issue is the timing. Breaking up while someone is in the hospital, especially when they're already stressed and unwell, is generally considered inconsiderate. Even if there's infidelity, the method and timing matter. The author could have waited until she was more stable, perhaps, but he felt the need to act immediately due to the emotional shock. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's actions (sending nudes to someone she's reconnecting with, even if she's seeking validation) are a breach of trust. The author's reaction is understandable but the timing is poor. The community might argue that the author is in the wrong because of the timing, but others might say the infidelity justifies the breakup. \n\nBut the way he handled it\u2014confronting her right then, in the hospital, and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. The stress of a hospitalization is already hard enough, and adding a breakup on top could be seen as cruel. Even if the author is upset, the right action might have been to wait until the situation was less acute. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong for the timing and method of the breakup, even if the reason is justified. The answer would be A.\n"
