We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for almost three years. The girlfriend is in the hospital with possible serious health issues. The author finds out through her phone that she's been sending nudes to an ex she blocked for being too flirty, even when they were together. He breaks up with her while she's in the hospital, which adds stress to her situation.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Cheating or betrayal is a major issue in relationships. If the girlfriend was indeed sending explicit photos to another person while in a committed relationship, that's a breach of trust. The author discovered this through her phone, which raises privacy concerns. However, the context matters here. She gave him her passcode multiple times, so maybe she didn't expect her privacy to be so compromised. But still, checking her messages without her knowledge is a violation of trust.\n\nThe timing of the breakup is another point. She's already in a vulnerable state due to her health. Breaking up during such a stressful time could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might feel that the betrayal was too much to handle, even under the circumstances. The emotional impact of both the breakup and the health issues could be overwhelming for her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did break up with her during a critical time. Even if he found out about her actions, the timing might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, he might feel that the relationship was over because of her actions. There's also the method of discovery\u2014using her phone without her consent. That's a point against him, but the question is about the breakup itself.\n\nCheating is a valid reason for breaking up, but the timing and method of the breakup matter. The author's actions could be viewed as both justified (due to betrayal) and unethical (timing and privacy violation). The question is whether the timing makes him the asshole.\n\nIn terms of the options, A is if he's wrong, B if not. Considering that breaking up during hospitalization adds unnecessary stress, maybe A is the answer. However, the cheating is a significant issue. It's a tough call. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the act of breaking up during her hospital stay might be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The method of discovery also isn't the focus here, but the breakup timing. So leaning towards A, but not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe not, because the reason is valid. Hmm.\n"
