We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author found out that his girlfriend had been reconnecting with a guy she blocked before and sent him nudes, even when they were together. That's definitely cheating or at least a breach of trust. But the breakup happened while she was in the hospital, which adds a layer of sensitivity.\n\nThe author was already there supporting her through her health issues. He waited until her dad arrived before confronting her, which shows he tried to be considerate. He didn't just leave her alone in the hospital. But breaking up during a time when she's already stressed about her health could add more stress, which is harsh. However, if the cheating was a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's just something he couldn't overlook, even in a tough time.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up in the hospital might be seen as cruel. She's already dealing with her health issues, and adding emotional stress isn't fair. But he tried to handle it with some care by getting her dad there and not being confrontational. The key points are whether the infidelity is a valid reason to break up and if the timing was appropriate.\n\nInfidelity is generally considered a serious issue in relationships. If the author couldn't get past that, it's understandable. However, doing it during her hospital stay complicates things. The author might be in the right for ending things over cheating, but the timing and method could be questioned. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user might be looking for a balance between the validity of the reason (cheating) versus the method (breaking up during hospitalization). If the cheating is a legitimate reason, then the author isn't the asshole. But if the method was unnecessarily harsh, maybe he is. However, the story says he tried to be considerate by getting her dad there and not being aggressive. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because the reason is valid, even if the timing is tough. So answer B.\n"
