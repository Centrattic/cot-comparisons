We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to someone else, which he discovered by checking her phone. They've been together three years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital for possible serious medical issues, which is already a stressful time. The author found out about the cheating through her phone. Now, the question is whether breaking up during such a vulnerable time is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a major betrayal. If someone is unfaithful, it's understandable to end the relationship, especially if it's a dealbreaker for the person. The fact that she was sending nudes while they were together on weekends adds to the betrayal. The author might feel that this was a fundamental violation of trust, and perhaps he couldn't handle the situation while she was in the hospital.\n\nBut on the other hand, the timing is really bad. She's already dealing with health issues, which could make the breakup more traumatic. The author says he waited until her dad was there, which shows he considered her well-being to some extent. However, breaking up someone during a hospital stay might be seen as cruel or insensitive, regardless of the reason. \n\nThere's also the issue of checking her phone. Even if she gave him the passcode, invading her privacy like that might be unethical. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the breakup itself, not the method of finding out. \n\nThe author did confront her calmly and didn't yell, which is a positive. He also apologized to her dad for making him leave. So he did take some responsibility for the disruption. \n\nIn terms of whether cheating is a valid reason to break up, that's subjective. Some people would say it's a legitimate reason, others might think there's room for forgiveness or discussion. But given the emotional impact, it's not unthinkable to end things immediately if trust is broken.\n\nSo weighing all this: the betrayal is significant, but the timing is poor. However, the author's actions in confronting her and ensuring she wasn't alone when he left shows some consideration. The question is whether the timing (during hospitalization) makes the breakup inconsiderate despite the reason. \n\nI think the key here is whether the breakup was the right decision given the circumstances. While cheating is a serious issue, adding emotional stress during a health crisis could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might not be in the wrong if he felt the need to end things immediately upon discovering the betrayal. \n\nBut maybe the community would see breaking up during such a time as adding unnecessary stress. However, the alternative is to fake it and deal with the betrayal, which might not be healthy for the author either. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being the asshole here. The cheating is a valid reason, and while the timing is tough, the decision to end the relationship is understandable. So answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
