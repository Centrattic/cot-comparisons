We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The situation involves discovering that his girlfriend sent nudes to another guy via WhatsApp during the time they were together, even though they don't use that app to communicate. He found out about this during her hospital stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements: the girlfriend was in the hospital with a possible serious medical issue (dizziness, weakness in limbs\u2014could be a stroke or other neurological problem). The author broke up with her while she was there. The main question is whether breaking up in this context was wrong.\n\nThe author's actions: He broke up with her after discovering her infidelity. He waited until her father arrived to be there for her, which shows he tried to be considerate. However, breaking up someone while they're in a vulnerable, stressful situation like a hospital could be seen as cruel. On the other hand, discovering cheating is a valid reason for a breakup, regardless of timing. The stress of the hospital might be an added factor, but the core issue is betrayal.\n\nIs the timing of the breakup inconsiderate? Yes, because she's already dealing with health issues and the emotional impact of being dumped could exacerbate her stress. However, the decision to end the relationship due to cheating is understandable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the timing and context.\n\nIn the \"AITA\" subreddit, the community often considers both the validity of the action (cheating is a common reason for breakup, so not wrong) and the manner in which it's done. Breaking up via phone or in person while someone is hospitalized might be seen as harsh, but if the reason is justified (cheating), the person might not be considered the asshole. The author did take steps to ensure she wasn't alone (her dad was there), which is a positive. The girlfriend's actions were deceitful, which adds to the justification for the breakup.\n\nHowever, the hospital setting adds complexity. Dumping someone during a health crisis can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid. The community might split on this. But since the author's reason is a legitimate one (cheating), the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A (in the wrong) due to the timing. The key here is that the decision to end the relationship is based on a valid reason, even if the timing is unfortunate. The subreddit often focuses more on the reason rather than the timing unless the timing is entirely malicious.\n"
