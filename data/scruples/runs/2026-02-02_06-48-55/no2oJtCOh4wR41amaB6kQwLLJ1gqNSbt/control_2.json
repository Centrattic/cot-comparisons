We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was in the hospital with possible serious health issues, and the author broke up with her during this time. He found out about her sending nudes to someone she had previously blocked for being too flirty. The author waited until her dad was present before confronting her, then left, and hasn't communicated since.\n\nNow, cheating or betrayal in a relationship is a valid reason for breaking up. However, timing and context matter. Breaking up with someone when they're already under stress from a medical emergency could be seen as cruel. The author might have valid reasons for feeling betrayed, but the timing of the breakup adds another layer of stress during a vulnerable time.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014sending nudes while allegedly in a committed relationship\u2014could be considered a betrayal. The author's discovery of these messages through her phone adds another ethical consideration. Even if the girlfriend gave her passcode, checking her WhatsApp without permission might be seen as a violation of trust. However, the author might argue that he had a right to know if she was being unfaithful.\n\nThe emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant. Being in the hospital is already stressful, and a breakup during that time could exacerbate her stress, which might affect her recovery. The author's emotional state (crying) suggests he was hurt, but the timing of the breakup might not be the best.\n\nThere's a balance between personal integrity and compassion. The author has the right to end a relationship if he feels betrayed, but doing so during her hospitalization could be seen as insensitive. However, he might also feel that he couldn't fake being okay, so he chose honesty, even if it was painful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's actions were wrong, but the author's decision to break up during her hospital stay might be seen as exacerbating her hardship. However, it's also possible that he felt he couldn't continue the relationship knowing about her infidelity.\n\nUltimately, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the focus is on the betrayal, the author isn't at fault. If the focus is on the timing and added stress, he might be considered insensitive. However, since the user is asking for a choice between A (Yes) and B (No), I need to decide which aspect is more significant. The act of breaking up over cheating is understandable, but the timing complicates it. However, the author did wait until her dad was there, which shows he tried to be considerate. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the betrayal is a valid reason, even if the timing is bad.\n"
