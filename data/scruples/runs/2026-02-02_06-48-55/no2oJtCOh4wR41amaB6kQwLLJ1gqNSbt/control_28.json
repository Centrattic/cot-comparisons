We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation is that he found out she was sending nudes to someone else, which he discovered by looking through her phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital, which is a stressful and vulnerable time. The author found out about her infidelity or at least some form of betrayal through her WhatsApp messages. The key points here are the act of breaking up during her hospitalization, the method of discovering the information (reading her phone without consent?), and the emotional impact.\n\nWait, she gave him her phone, and he used her passcode to check her WhatsApp. So maybe he had permission to have the phone, but did he have permission to look into her WhatsApp? That's a gray area. If she gave him the phone to hold, opening WhatsApp without her consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. But maybe he had a right to know if he suspected something.\n\nThe author confronted her after the MRI, which is when she was already in the hospital. The breakup happened during a time when she's already under medical stress. Even if she was unfaithful, breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be seen as harsh. However, the author might feel that the betrayal was so significant that he couldn't wait. \n\nHe did wait until her dad was there for support and then left, which shows he tried to handle it responsibly. But the timing of the breakup adds stress on top of her health issues. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. On one hand, the girlfriend's actions were wrong (sending nudes to someone else). On the other hand, breaking up during her hospital stay could be seen as adding insult to injury. The method of discovering her messages might also be questionable. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). The community often debates these, but in many cases, the person who discovers infidelity might be seen as justified in ending the relationship, even if the timing is tough. However, the act of reading her phone without explicit consent might be a point against him. \n\nSo, the answer could be a mix, but since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, I need to pick. The main issue is the breakup timing. Some might say it's wrong to break up during her hospitalization, others might say it's better to do it sooner rather than later. The fact that he tried to handle it with her dad there might mitigate some of the criticism. However, the act of checking her phone without her knowledge (even if she gave the code) could be seen as a privacy violation. \n\nOverall, there's a case for both sides, but since the question is about whether he's the asshole, the answer might lean towards A if the focus is on the method of discovery and the timing. However, if the focus is on her infidelity, then B. But given the context, the answer is likely A because of the timing and the way he found out.\n"
