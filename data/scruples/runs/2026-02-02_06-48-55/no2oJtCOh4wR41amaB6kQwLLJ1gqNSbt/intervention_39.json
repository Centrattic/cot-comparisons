We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was in the hospital with symptoms that might be serious. The author stayed with her, took care of her, and then found out about her sending nudes to an ex on weekends they were together. That's cheating or at least a betrayal. The author confronted her and broke up, which caused her more stress.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author discovered the cheating, which is a valid reason for breaking up. However, timing is a big issue. She's in the hospital, already stressed about her health. The breakup adds emotional stress during a vulnerable time. Even though the author waited until her dad was there, the act of breaking up during such a critical moment could be seen as harsh. The author admitted he couldn't fake it, so maybe he felt it was necessary to be honest. But the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a major betrayal. The author has every right to end the relationship. On the other hand, doing so while she's in the hospital might be seen as insensitive, regardless of the reason. The stress of a breakup could impact her recovery. But if the author couldn't handle the relationship anymore, maybe it's necessary. The author did apologize for making her dad come over quickly, showing some consideration.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. The validity of the reason versus the timing. If the author had waited until she was out of the hospital, maybe it would be better. But given the circumstances, the author might have felt it was urgent. However, the emotional impact on her is significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't the asshole for ending the relationship because cheating is a valid reason. But the timing might make him in the wrong. Or maybe the act itself is justified, so he's not in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the reason for the breakup is valid. However, the way it was handled during her hospitalization could be criticized. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the main issue is the breakup due to cheating, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue the timing is wrong. It's a tough call. The author's actions were in response to betrayal, so perhaps he's justified. So maybe answer B.\n"
