We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The key points here are the circumstances surrounding the breakup and the reasons provided.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was admitted to the hospital with symptoms that could indicate a serious health issue, like a stroke. The author was with her during her stay, and upon finding out about her infidelity through her WhatsApp messages, he decided to break up. The timing is crucial here because she's already under stress from her medical condition.\n\nNow, the question is whether breaking up during such a vulnerable time was the right call. On one hand, cheating is a significant breach of trust, and the author has every right to feel hurt and want to end the relationship. On the other hand, doing so while she's in the hospital could be seen as adding emotional stress during a time when she needs support. \n\nThe author mentions he confronted her calmly and waited for her dad to be present, which shows consideration. However, timing is everything. Hospitalizing someone is a critical period, and breaking up then might not be the most compassionate approach. The author might have prioritized his emotional needs over hers, which could be viewed as harsh, even if the infidelity is a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the author's method of discovering the infidelity by checking her phone is a point to consider. If the phone was in his possession, maybe there was a misunderstanding or a privacy issue. But the main question is about the breakup timing. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while the girlfriend's actions were wrong, the author's decision to end things during her hospital stay could be seen as inconsiderate. The stress of a medical crisis and the breakup might compound her emotional difficulties. However, the author's feelings are valid, and he has the right to end the relationship if the trust is broken.\n\nSo, the dilemma is between the validity of the reason for the breakup (cheating) and the timing (during a hospital stay). The answer hinges on whether the timing was inconsiderate despite the reason. Some might argue that the author isn't the asshole because cheating is a legitimate reason, but others might say he was inconsiderate in his timing. \n\nGiven the context, I think the author is partially in the wrong for the timing, even if the cheating is justified. The stress of being in the hospital is significant, and breaking up then adds to her burden. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the inconsiderate timing, even if the reason for the breakup is valid.\n"
