We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 3-year relationship. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with concerning symptoms. The author discovers through her phone that she was sending nudes to another guy, which they consider cheating. They break up the same day she's in the hospital.\n\nNow, the key points. The author found out about the cheating via her phone. They confronted her while she was in the hospital, then left. The question is whether this action makes them the asshole.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong (A):\n\n1. **Breaking up during a health crisis**: The girlfriend is already stressed and unwell. Ending the relationship at this time could add significant emotional stress, which might be seen as cruel, especially if she's dealing with possible serious health issues.\n\n2. **Privacy issues**: The author accessed her phone without prior consent, even though she gave the passcode multiple times. However, the act of opening WhatsApp and reading messages could be considered an invasion of privacy, which is a breach of trust.\n\n3. **Timing and emotional impact**: The breakup happens when she's vulnerable and in the hospital. Even if the author felt hurt, the timing could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend might be dealing with her health while simultaneously processing a breakup.\n\n4. **Communication approach**: The author confronted her after the MRI, which might not have been the best time. They did wait for her dad to be there, which shows some consideration, but the overall timing is questionable.\n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong (B):\n\n1. **Discovery of infidelity**: Cheating is a major betrayal. The author discovered that the girlfriend had been sending explicit messages to another person, which many would consider cheating. This is a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\n2. **Respect for the father**: The author informed the girlfriend's father and waited for him to be present before confronting her, which shows they tried to handle the situation with care.\n\n3. **Emotional distress**: The author was clearly emotional and apologized for involving the father. They might have felt unable to fake being okay, leading to the breakup decision.\n\n4. **Prior validation issues**: The author mentions they constantly complimented the girlfriend, yet she sought validation elsewhere. This could indicate deeper issues in the relationship that the author might have felt were insurmountable.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The act of breaking up while someone is in the hospital is a strong point towards the author being the asshole (A). The health crisis is a vulnerable time, and adding a breakup could be seen as extremely inconsiderate. However, the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, which might justify the decision. The key is whether the timing and method were appropriate.\n\nPrivacy breach is another factor. Even though the author had access to the phone, opening private messages without consent could be seen as a violation. However, the girlfriend had given the passcode multiple times, which complicates the privacy argument. The author might believe they had the right to check due to the passcode access.\n\nThe emotional impact is significant. The girlfriend is dealing with her health, and the breakup adds to her stress. The author's emotional state (crying and sobbing) shows their pain, but it doesn't mitigate the inconsiderate timing.\n\nBalancing these factors, the main issue is the timing of the breakup. Even though cheating is a valid reason, doing so while the other person is in the hospital is inconsiderate. The author's actions, while understandable due to betrayal, might be seen as harsh and insensitive given the circumstances. Therefore, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
