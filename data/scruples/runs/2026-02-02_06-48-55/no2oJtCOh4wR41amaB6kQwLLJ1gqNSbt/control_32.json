We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves him discovering she was sending nudes to someone else through WhatsApp. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in the hospital, which is a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity, which is a significant issue in a relationship. Cheating can be a deal-breaker for many people, and the author felt he couldn't fake it anymore.\n\nBut breaking up someone while they're in the hospital adds another layer. Is it compassionate to end a relationship at such a vulnerable time? On the other hand, the author waited until her dad was there, so she wasn't alone. He also apologized for involving her dad, which shows he considered her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the betrayal and the timing. While cheating is a major issue, the timing during her hospitalization might be seen as cruel. However, the author didn't confront her in a harmful way; he broke up with her after ensuring she was safe and not alone. \n\nIs it wrong to end the relationship? If the infidelity was genuine and the author couldn't continue, then it's a valid reason. But the timing and the method matter. The author's actions might be justified if the relationship was beyond repair. However, some might argue that breaking up during her hospital stay adds unnecessary stress when she's already unwell. \n\nBut the alternative is pretending everything is fine and staying for her medical support, which could be equally harmful. The author felt he couldn't fake it, so he chose to end it. It's a tough call. The fact that she was dishonest by using WhatsApp, which they didn't use for communication, also plays a role. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The cheating is a valid reason, and he tried to handle it as gently as possible given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, not the asshole).\n"
