We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been dating for three years. She suddenly gets sick, goes to the hospital, and he's there taking care of her. While she's doing an MRI, he takes her phone (which she gave him the passcode for) and finds out she was sending nudes to another guy over the past three months, even on weekends they were together. He confronts her, then leaves, and the question is whether he was right to break up with her during her hospital stay.\n\nFirst, infidelity is a major issue in relationships. If she cheated, then breaking up over that is understandable. However, the timing is during a hospitalization, which could add stress for her. The author found out through her phone, which raises privacy concerns. She gave him the passcode, so maybe it's a gray area. Did she know he would access her WhatsApp? Also, he informed her dad, which might be a good move to get support, but he left her in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up during her hospitalization was wrong. On one hand, cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. On the other hand, she's already stressed from being in the hospital. The author was emotional and couldn't fake being okay, so he left. Maybe he should have stayed to support her even while ending the relationship. But if the relationship is over due to infidelity, then it's reasonable to end it. However, the method of breaking up might be harsh given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, using her dad to support her after breaking up shows he considered her well-being. He apologized for making her dad come. So maybe he's not entirely wrong. The key points are: she cheated, he ended the relationship, but did it during a difficult time. The answer depends on whether breaking up for cheating is justified, regardless of timing, or if the timing made it worse. Since cheating is a dealbreaker, he's justified, but the way he handled it might be seen as harsh. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the cheating is the main issue, and he had a reason to break up. However, some might argue he should have waited until she was out of the hospital. But given the circumstances, breaking up because of infidelity is valid. So I think the answer is B.\n"
