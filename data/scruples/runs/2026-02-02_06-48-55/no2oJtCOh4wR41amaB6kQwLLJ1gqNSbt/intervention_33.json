We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for breaking up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out she was cheating. \n\nFirst, the context: They found out she sent nudes to an ex she had blocked, on weekends they were together. He confronted her in the hospital, then left, and she's now dealing with the stress of medical issues.\n\nSo, the main points here. Cheating is a big deal. If someone is being unfaithful, it's understandable to want to end the relationship. However, doing so while the person is already in the hospital adds another layer. She's physically unwell, which might make the timing of the breakup more hurtful. But he waited until after her MRI, after her dad arrived, and tried to be as gentle as possible. He even apologized to her dad for making him come over.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up during a hospital stay is wrong. On one hand, she's already stressed about her health. Adding emotional stress could be harmful. On the other hand, if there's been betrayal, the breakup is justified. But maybe he could have waited until she was more stable to inform her, so it's not compounding her stress. However, he didn't know she was in the hospital for sure at the time of the discovery. He found out about the cheating during his visit, so the timing was immediate.\n\nAlso, he did check with her dad before leaving, ensuring she wasn't alone. That shows consideration. He didn't confront her in the middle of medical procedures, which could have been even worse. Still, the emotional impact of being dumped in such a vulnerable moment might be seen as cruel, even if justified.\n\nBut the cheating is a major issue. People might argue that honesty is important and that the breakup was necessary regardless of timing. However, the method of breaking up could be seen as inconsiderate. Maybe he should have waited until she was out of the hospital, but he couldn't fake it anymore. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both the validity of the reason and the manner. Here, the reason is strong (cheating), but the timing is questionable. However, the way he handled it\u2014waiting until after tests, involving her dad, not being confrontational\u2014might mitigate some of the blame. \n\nBut the act of breaking up while she's in a vulnerable state for a reason unrelated to the relationship could be seen as wrong. The stress of hospitalization is already high; adding a breakup might be seen as compounding her distress. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit of a toss-up. However, since the cheating is a valid reason, and he tried to be as considerate as possible given the circumstances, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might say the timing is inconsiderate. The community often splits here, but the key is whether the action was justified despite the timing. In AITA context, if the reason is substantial (cheating), and the method as gentle as possible under the circumstances, the answer might lean towards not the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
