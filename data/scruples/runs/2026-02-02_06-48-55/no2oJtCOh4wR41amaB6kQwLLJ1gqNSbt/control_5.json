We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering her infidelity.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together for almost three years. The girlfriend was admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggesting a possible stroke. The author found out she was sending nudes to someone she blocked for being too flirty, including on weekends they were together. He confronted her after she came out of the MRI, then broke up with her via Uber, leaving her with her dad present.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Cheating is a major betrayal. The author discovered her infidelity through her phone, which she had given him the passcode for. While accessing her phone without permission might be questionable, in some cases, people might justify it if they suspect infidelity. However, privacy is important, so there's a gray area here.\n\nTiming of the breakup is crucial. She was already stressed from her medical issues. Adding emotional stress during her hospitalization could be seen as cruel. However, the author might feel that he couldn't fake being okay with the betrayal, leading to a breakup that's necessary for his well-being. \n\nThe method of breakup\u2014leaving her in the hospital with her dad\u2014was done to ensure she wasn't alone. He apologized for making her dad leave, which shows consideration. But breaking up over cheating, even under stressful circumstances, is a personal choice. \n\nIs it valid to break up over cheating? Most would say yes. However, the timing and method matter. Breaking up during a health crisis could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The author is prioritizing his own emotional state, but the girlfriend is dealing with her own health issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's justified in ending the relationship due to her infidelity. On the other hand, doing so while she's in the hospital might be seen as insensitive. The act of checking her phone without her knowledge is also a privacy violation. The breakup method was abrupt and might have added unnecessary stress.\n\nBalancing these factors, the answer depends on cultural and personal values. But given the circumstances, the author might be considered in the wrong for the timing and method, even if the infidelity is a valid reason to end the relationship. The hospitalization complicates things, making the breakup more stressful for her. Hence, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
