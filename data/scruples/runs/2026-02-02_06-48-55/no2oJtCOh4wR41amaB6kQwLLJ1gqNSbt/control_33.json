We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out she was sending nudes to another guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with symptoms that could be serious (dizziness, weakness). The guy is there with her, taking care of her. Then, while waiting for an MRI, he finds out she's been sending nudes to an ex she blocked for being too flirty, and doing this on weekends they were together. He confronts her after the MRI, breaks up with her, and leaves, then apologizes to her dad for making him come over.\n\nNow, the key questions here. Is breaking up while she's in the hospital wrong? Well, she's already under stress from her health issues. Adding emotional stress could be harmful. But on the other hand, if he found out about her infidelity or betrayal, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. The problem is the timing\u2014doing so during her hospitalization could be considered cruel, as it adds more stress when she's vulnerable. However, he did wait until she was safe and had her dad there, which shows some consideration.\n\nHe found out she was cheating? Well, the story says she sent nudes to someone she blocked for being too flirty, and he feels it's a betrayal because he was complimenting her daily. But are nudes equivalent to cheating? That depends on their definition of cheating. If they considered exchanging nudes with someone else as cheating, then yes. But if they had different boundaries, maybe not. The guy seems to think it's a deal-breaker, which it could be. However, the fact that she was doing this while they were together on weekends adds to the betrayal.\n\nHis actions: He didn't yell, just cried and asked why. He left quickly but made sure she wasn't alone by having her dad there. He apologized for involving her dad. So his approach was more about emotional honesty rather than being cruel. However, breaking up during hospitalization might not be the most considerate time. But he couldn't fake being okay with it, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, discovering betrayal is a valid reason to end a relationship. On the other, doing so when the person is already stressed from health issues might be seen as adding insult to injury. However, the story mentions that he handled it as carefully as he could under the circumstances. The key point is whether the breakup was justified given the betrayal. If the betrayal is a legitimate deal-breaker, then he's not the asshole. But if he's being overly harsh in timing, maybe. But the community often weighs the validity of the reason first. Since the reason is cheating (even if it's not physical), the community might side that he's not the asshole. However, the timing could be seen as cruel. But given the situation, maybe it's a necessary conversation. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. Let me check again.\n\nThe main factors: Valid reason for breakup (cheating), handled as considerately as possible given the situation, but timing adds stress. The community usually considers the validity of the reason first. If the reason is valid, even if poorly timed, the person might not be the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
