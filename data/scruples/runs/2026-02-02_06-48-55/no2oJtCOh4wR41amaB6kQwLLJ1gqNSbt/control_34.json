We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nThey've been dating almost three years. The girlfriend had health issues, went to the ER, and the author went to the hospital. While she was getting an MRI, he looked at her phone (she gave him the passcode) and found WhatsApp messages where she was sending nudes to another guy she had previously blocked for being too flirty. The author then confronted her and broke up with her, leaving her alone in the hospital. The question is if he was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, first thought: Cheating is a major deal. If someone is sending nudes to another person while in a relationship, that's a breach of trust. But the situation is complicated because the breakup happened while she was in the hospital. The author might be seen as cruel because he added emotional stress during a time when she's already unwell. However, some might argue that the infidelity was a valid reason to end the relationship, even if it was under difficult circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions that he didn't yell, just cried and then left. Also, he made sure her dad was there before confronting her, which shows he tried to handle it considerately. But still, breaking up someone in the hospital could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, he tried to handle it with some care, like not leaving her alone and apologizing to her dad.\n\nBut then, was it the right time? Maybe. She's in the hospital for medical reasons, and the breakup would add to her stress. However, the infidelity is a personal betrayal. So it's a tough balance. The question is whether the author was wrong for prioritizing his feelings and the discovery of cheating over her health situation.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to look through her phone? She gave him the passcode, but that doesn't necessarily mean she allowed him to access her private messages. Some might say that was a breach of privacy. However, he did do it when she gave him the phone to hold, so maybe he felt justified because he was worried about cheating. But using her passcode (which she gave him multiple times) to access her WhatsApp might be seen as violating trust in another way.\n\nSo, if he found out about the cheating, that's a valid reason to break up. But doing it in the hospital might be insensitive. However, the timing might not be the author's fault because he found out during the hospital stay. The key points are the infidelity and the method of breakup.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is conflicted. He feels bad but couldn't fake it anymore. The community might debate: some say he's in the right because cheating is unforgivable, others say he's in the wrong for making her go through breakup stress during health issues.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior: sending nudes to someone she was supposed to have blocked, on weekends they were together\u2014this is clear cheating. So maybe the author is justified, but the timing is bad.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the community prioritizes the validity of the reason (cheating) over the timing (hospital). If the reason is valid, then the author isn't the asshole. If the method (timing) is seen as cruel regardless of the reason, then he is.\n\nI think the consensus might be that while the timing is unfortunate, the infidelity is a valid reason, so the author isn't the asshole. But some might argue he should have handled it differently, like after she was released. But given the circumstances, he did try to be considerate (calling her dad before confronting her). So maybe answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
