We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The key points are that she was being checked for possible health issues, and he found out she was sending nudes to another guy through WhatsApp. He confronted her and then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for three years. She's in the hospital, which is already a stressful time. He discovered her infidelity, which is a major betrayal. But the question is whether breaking up with her while she's in the hospital is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he found out about her cheating and felt the need to confront her immediately. Cheating is a serious issue, and many people might consider it grounds for a breakup. However, she's in a vulnerable state due to her health situation. Adding emotional stress at a time when she's already dealing with physical and possible mental stress could be seen as cruel. \n\nHe mentioned that he waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which shows he tried to be considerate of her support system. But breaking up during such a critical time might not be the kindest approach. He also says he couldn't fake it, which suggests he was emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nBut the other side is that he had every right to feel betrayed. If she was cheating, it's understandable that he would want to end the relationship. However, the timing and the method\u2014during a hospital stay\u2014might be the issue. Maybe waiting until her health situation was stabilized could have been more compassionate, even if the decision to break up was necessary.\n\nSo the debate is between the validity of the reason for the breakup (cheating) versus the inconsiderate timing. If the author is correct in his belief that the relationship is over due to infidelity, then the breakup is justified. However, the manner in which it was executed\u2014during her hospitalization\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and adding unnecessary stress. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for breaking up because of cheating? Probably not. The main question is whether it's wrong to do so during her hospital stay. If he had waited until she was better, maybe that would have been more thoughtful. But in terms of being in the wrong for the breakup itself, if cheating is a dealbreaker, then he's justified. However, some might argue that the timing was insensitive. \n\nThe Reddit format is \"Am I the Asshole?\" so the user is asking if they're the bad guy. The response would need to consider both the cheating and the timing. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on relationships and how to handle breakups during crises. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong for the timing. While the cheating is a valid reason, breaking up during hospitalization adds to her stress. But not necessarily entirely his fault. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he had a legitimate reason, but the timing was inconsiderate, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) for the way he handled it, not the decision itself.\n"
