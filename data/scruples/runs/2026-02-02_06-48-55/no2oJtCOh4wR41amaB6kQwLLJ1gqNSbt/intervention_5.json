We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. \n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend had medical issues, was in the hospital, and the boyfriend discovered she was sending nudes to an ex she blocked for being too flirty. She did this on weekends they were together. He broke up with her during her hospital stay.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and betrayal. Cheating, even if not physically, can be a major deal-breaker. The girlfriend was unfaithful, which is a serious breach of trust. The boyfriend found out about this, which caused him emotional distress, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the hospital situation. She's already under stress due to her health. The breakup adds more stress, which could be harmful. However, the boyfriend didn't confront her in the hospital immediately when she was checked in. He waited until after the MRI, when she was settled. He also made sure her dad was there for support before breaking up with her. He tried to be considerate by not yelling and being emotional but also ensuring she wasn't alone.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The act of breaking up someone while they're in the hospital, especially over a betrayal like this, is a tough call. On one hand, he has the right to end the relationship if there's infidelity. On the other hand, timing is crucial. She's dealing with her health issues, and adding a breakup might exacerbate her stress. However, the boyfriend might not have been able to fake being okay, which could be worse for her in the long run.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were dishonest. She sent nudes to someone she was supposed to avoid, which is a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable, but the timing of the breakup during her hospitalization could be seen as adding insult to injury.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The betrayal is on her part, but the timing of the breakup could be seen as harsh. However, if he couldn't maintain a relationship with her knowing her infidelity, then he's justified in ending it. The key is whether breaking up during her hospital stay was unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is not in the wrong because the betrayal was significant, and he handled it with some consideration (waiting until her dad was there, being emotional but not aggressive). On the other hand, some might argue that he should have waited until she was out of the hospital to break up with her to avoid additional stress.\n\nBut considering the situation, the betrayal is a major factor. If the relationship was based on trust, which it seems to be, then ending it over this is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But others might still say A, arguing that the timing was inconsiderate. However, given the circumstances, B might be more accurate.\n"
