We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. They broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital after discovering she had sent nudes to another guy. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a health issue requiring hospitalization. The author was there with her, which shows he cared. But then he found out about her sending nudes to a guy she previously blocked for being too flirty. He confronted her, and then broke up, leaving her in the hospital. The key points here are the context of the breakup, the method of discovery, and the emotional state of both parties.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's actions\u2014cheating or engaging in inappropriate behavior\u2014could be a reason to break up. However, doing so while she's in the hospital adds stress during a vulnerable time. The author might be justified in ending the relationship due to betrayal, but the timing is questionable. He waited until her dad was there, which is thoughtful, but leaving immediately might not give her time to process. Also, he found her phone without her consent, which is a breach of trust. Even if she gave the passcode, using her phone to check WhatsApp without her knowledge could be considered invasive. That act itself could be seen as a violation of privacy, which complicates the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were deceitful. If she was in a committed relationship and had an emotional/physical affair, that's a breach of trust. The author might feel justified in ending things, especially if he's hurt. But the method of breakup\u2014during her hospitalization\u2014could be seen as cruel. However, the author might not be able to fake being okay, leading to the breakup. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: 1) Breaking up during hospitalization adds stress. 2) Privacy violation by checking her phone. 3) The girlfriend's infidelity. \n\nThe answer depends on weighing these factors. The author's actions (checking phone) might be a fault, but the girlfriend's betrayal is a significant issue. The breakup timing is harsh, but the author's emotional reaction is understandable. The answer could be either way. However, in terms of accountability, the author's privacy violation is a problem. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's actions. So, the author might not be the asshole, but there are elements where he's in the wrong. But since the main question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up during hospitalization and the method, the answer could be A or B. Given that the breach of trust by the girlfriend is valid, and the author's breakup is a response, but the method (checking phone) is problematic. Hmm. This is a tough one. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation, but the breakup itself might be justified. However, in these kinds of situations, the act of checking her phone without permission is a major issue. So the author's actions contribute to him being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
