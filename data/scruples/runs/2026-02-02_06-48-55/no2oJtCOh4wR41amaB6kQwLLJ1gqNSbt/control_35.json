We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to another guy on WhatsApp, even when they were together on weekends. He waited until her dad was there to confront her, then left, crying. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, the main points: She's in the hospital with possible health issues, which is already a stressful time. He discovered her infidelity through her phone, which she gave him the passcode for. The fact that she was sending nudes to someone she blocked for being too flirty is a betrayal. He confronted her calmly, then left, and apologized to her dad for making him come over.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, breaking up during her hospitalization adds to her stress, which is harsh. But on the other hand, infidelity is a major issue that can justify ending a relationship. He didn't act recklessly; he waited for her dad to be there and handled it with some care. The key here is whether the betrayal is a valid reason to end things, even in a tough time.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If she was cheating, that's a deal-breaker for many. The author's emotional reaction is understandable. However, timing is a factor. But does the timing make it his fault? Maybe not. He couldn't fake it anymore. The decision to leave was hard, but if the relationship was already broken by her actions, then maybe it's not his fault. The answer might be B (No), because he had a valid reason and tried to handle it responsibly despite the timing.\n"
