We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking about a breakup that happened while the girlfriend was in the hospital. The key points are that the girlfriend was admitted for health issues, the boyfriend found out she was sending nudes to an ex on WhatsApp, and he broke up with her while she was in the hospital.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions of both parties. The girlfriend was in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time. The boyfriend discovered she was being unfaithful by sending explicit photos to someone she had previously blocked for being too flirty. He waited until her father was there before confronting her and then left, which might have added emotional stress during her recovery. \n\nNow, the main question is whether breaking up under these circumstances makes the author the asshole. On one hand, cheating (or in this case, sending nudes to someone else while in a relationship) is generally considered a betrayal. The boyfriend had every right to be upset and might feel the relationship is over. However, the context of her being in the hospital adds complexity. Breaking up during such a stressful time could be seen as cruel, as it adds emotional distress when she's already dealing with physical health issues.\n\nBut the boyfriend was also in the hospital with her, supporting her. He found out about the WhatsApp messages, which might indicate a breach of trust. The fact that she sent nudes on weekends they were together suggests deceit. The boyfriend's reaction was to confront her calmly and then leave, which might be his way of handling the situation to protect his emotions. \n\nHowever, considering the hospital setting, some might argue that the breakup could be seen as inconsiderate, as it's an added stressor. Others might say that honesty and dealing with the betrayal are necessary, even if it's a tough time. The boyfriend also involved her father, which might be appropriate to ensure she's not alone during the confrontation. \n\nIt's also important to note that the girlfriend was the one who initiated the inappropriate communication. The boyfriend's actions were a response to her actions. The validity of the reason for the breakup (cheating) is a strong factor. If the user is asking if he's wrong for breaking up over cheating, traditionally, the person who cheated is more in the wrong. But the timing of the breakup during her hospital stay complicates things. \n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend's actions were definitely wrong, the boyfriend's decision to break up during her hospitalization could be seen as harsh. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural or personal values regarding timing versus the reason for the breakup. Since cheating is a major issue, the boyfriend's actions might be justified, but the timing might make some question his approach. But in terms of being \"the asshole,\" the primary wrongdoer here is the girlfriend. The boyfriend's actions, while potentially insensitive in timing, are a reaction to her betrayal. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
