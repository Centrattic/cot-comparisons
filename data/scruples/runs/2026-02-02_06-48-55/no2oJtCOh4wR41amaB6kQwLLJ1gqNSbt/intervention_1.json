We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe couple has been dating for almost three years. The girlfriend has health issues, and she's in the hospital. The guy discovers her sending nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, which they don't usually use. He breaks up with her while she's in the hospital, which adds to her stress.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the infidelity, the timing of the breakup, and the method of confronting her. The guy found out about the cheating, which is a valid reason for a breakup. But doing it while she's in the hospital seems harsh. Even though the relationship had issues, the timing could be seen as insensitive. He waited until her father was there, which is considerate, but leaving her in that state might be cruel. On the other hand, he might feel that the truth needs to come out regardless of the situation. \n\nCheating is a major betrayal, so breaking up over that is understandable. However, the method and timing might be questionable. The girlfriend's health is already compromised, and adding emotional stress could be harmful. The guy also mentioned he cried and was upset, which shows he wasn't cold about it. But is it wrong to end the relationship under these circumstances? \n\nI think there's a balance here. The guy isn't in the wrong for breaking up over cheating, but the timing and how he did it might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the act of cheating justifies the breakup. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong, but the approach could have been more thoughtful. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on prioritizing the betrayal over the timing. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because cheating is a valid reason, even if the timing was tough."
