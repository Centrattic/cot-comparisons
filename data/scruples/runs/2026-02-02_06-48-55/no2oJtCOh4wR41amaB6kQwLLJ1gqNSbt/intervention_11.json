We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves him finding out she sent nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, which they don't use to communicate. The girlfriend was in the hospital for symptoms that could indicate a serious issue, like a stroke or something. The author went into her phone with her passcode, found the messages, and then broke up with her, causing her more stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is in the hospital, possibly with a serious medical condition. The author discovered her infidelity or betrayal, which is a big deal in a relationship. But was the timing appropriate? Breaking up someone while they're in a vulnerable medical situation might be seen as heartless. Also, the author accessed her phone without her consent. Even though she gave her passcode to him, was it okay to go through her WhatsApp, which they don't use? Maybe she didn't expect him to check that app.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve both privacy invasion and emotional timing. The girlfriend's actions were clearly wrong (sending nudes to another guy), but the author's response might be seen as harsh given the context. Breaking up during her hospitalization adds stress at a time when she might need support. However, if the relationship had issues and the author found out something that made him realize the relationship was over, maybe it's justified. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main arguments against him are: violating privacy by checking her WhatsApp, breaking up during her hospital stay causing added stress. On the other side, the girlfriend was unfaithful, and the author had the right to end the relationship. However, the timing and method might be questionable. \n\nI think the key here is that while the girlfriend's actions are wrong, the author's method of confrontation and the timing could be considered inconsiderate. Breaking up someone in the hospital, especially when they're already under medical stress, might be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, using her passcode to access her private messages without her knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because of the way he handled the breakup, even if the reason (infidelity) is valid. The method and timing could be seen as cruel. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But others might argue that the infidelity justifies the breakup, and the author had a right to end the relationship regardless of the timing.\n"
