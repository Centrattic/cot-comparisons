We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves her having sent nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend was in the hospital with possible health issues, which adds a layer of stress and vulnerability. The author discovered her infidelity via WhatsApp messages, which she had sent despite being in a committed 3-year relationship. The author confronted her calmly and then left, which he admits made him feel like an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points: Is breaking up during her hospitalization considered wrong? Well, cheating is generally seen as a betrayal, and the author felt it was important to end the relationship rather than pretend. However, doing so while she's already under stress from health concerns might be seen as insensitive. But the author waited until her father was there, which shows consideration for her support system. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the timing wasn't ideal, but the act of cheating is a major issue. The author didn't act impulsively but took time to process and then made a decision. He also apologized to her father, showing he thought about the impact on others. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's action of breaking up over infidelity justifies the situation. Cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, even if it's harsh. The stress of the hospitalization is a factor, but the author couldn't fake being okay with the betrayal. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he had a legitimate reason and tried to handle it with some care.\n"
