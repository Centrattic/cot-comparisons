We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. They've been together for three years, and she was admitted for possible medical issues.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had health concerns, which is already a stressful time for her. The author found out about her sending nudes through WhatsApp, which she didn't use otherwise. The author waited until her dad was there to confront her, then left. The question is whether breaking up under these circumstances makes him the asshole.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The key points here are the context of the breakup and the method. Cheating or betrayal is a valid reason for breaking up, but doing so while the other person is in the hospital adds complexity. The author might be justified in feeling hurt and deciding to end the relationship, but timing and the method can affect that perception.\n\nHowever, the author did wait until her father was present, which shows some consideration for her well-being. The breakup wasn't done in the moment of discovery but after ensuring she was settled. The author also apologized for making her dad come over. On the other hand, breaking up during a medical crisis could be seen as insensitive, as it adds emotional stress during a vulnerable time.\n\nBut the girlfriend's actions\u2014sending nudes while supposedly in a committed relationship\u2014are a breach of trust. The author had every right to be upset. The question is whether the timing was appropriate. Breaking up in such a moment might be harsh, but the underlying reason (infidelity) is a strong justification. The author might not be in the wrong because the breakup is a reaction to betrayal, even if the timing is poor. The stress of the hospital situation could make the breakup more painful, but the author's decision is based on valid reasons.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author should have waited until after her medical situation was stable. However, the author couldn't fake being okay, which is understandable. The situation is tricky because both parties have valid points, but the core issue is the betrayal. So, the answer might lean toward the author not being the asshole (B) because the reason for breaking up is justified, even if the timing was difficult.\n"
