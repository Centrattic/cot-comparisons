We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to someone else via WhatsApp, which they don't normally use. He confronted her after the MRI, and then left, sobbing. Now he's asking if he was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital, which is already a stressful time for her. She was admitted with symptoms that could be serious, like dizziness and weakness, which might indicate something like a stroke or other neurological issue. The author was there with her, taking care of her, and then found out about her sending nudes.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did she cheat? She was sending nudes to someone else, which is a form of emotional infidelity at the least, maybe physical if they had contact. The author found out through her phone, which she gave him the password for. So technically, he didn't have to break into her phone; she gave him access. But using that access to check her WhatsApp without her consent might be a privacy issue. However, since she gave him the passcode, maybe he had the right to access it? Hmm, that's a bit of a gray area. Some might say that even if she gave him the passcode, checking her private messages without her permission is a breach of trust. Others might argue that since he was in a relationship with her, he had a right to know if she was being unfaithful.\n\nThen there's the timing of the breakup. She was in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time. Breaking up with someone during a medical crisis could add to her stress and emotional burden. The author felt he couldn't fake being okay, so he left. But is that the right time to break up? Maybe not. Some would say that even if there's a reason to break up, doing so when the person is already dealing with health issues is cruel. Others might think that honesty is important, and he had a valid reason to end the relationship because of her actions.\n\nThe author's actions: He confronted her calmly, didn't yell, and waited until her dad was there. He also made sure she was safe before leaving. He apologized to her dad for making him come over. So he tried to be considerate. But breaking up during a hospital stay is still questionable.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was that she didn't know why she did it. That's a red flag, maybe indicating emotional issues or seeking validation. The author felt validated in his decision because her behavior was deceitful and dishonest. But the timing and method of the breakup are under scrutiny here.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? On one hand, he discovered her infidelity and had a reason to end the relationship. On the other hand, doing so while she's in the hospital is seen as heartless. There's also the question of whether checking her phone was justified. If she gave him the password, maybe it's okay, but using it to check her private messages without her knowledge is a privacy violation. So, maybe he's partially at fault for checking her messages, which could have been handled differently. But if he found out the truth, he had a right to address it.\n\nIn terms of the breakup itself, the author did it in a moment of emotional distress. He couldn't fake being okay, so he left. Some might say that he shouldn't have broken up with her during such a vulnerable time, even if she was at fault. Others might say that if the relationship was built on lies, it's better to end it, even if it's a hard time for her.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not entirely at fault for the breakup, but the timing and method could be questioned. The main issue is whether he had the right to check her phone. If she gave him the password, it's a bit of a loophole, but using that to access private messages without consent is a problem. However, given the context, some might side with him because he discovered infidelity and made a difficult decision.\n\nI think the answer leans more towards A (the author is in the wrong) because breaking up during a hospital stay is considered inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. However, others might argue that the infidelity justified it. The checking of her phone also adds to the wrongdoing. So, I'm leaning towards A, but it's a tough call.\n"
