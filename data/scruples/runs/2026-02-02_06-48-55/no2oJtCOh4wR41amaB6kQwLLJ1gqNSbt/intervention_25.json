We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out through her WhatsApp that she had been sending nudes to someone else, which he discovered when he was holding her phone during an MRI. He waited until her dad arrived before confronting her and then left, feeling too upset to stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in the hospital with possible health issues, which is already a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity or betrayal, which is a serious issue in a relationship. Cheating or emotional infidelity can be a deal-breaker for many people. However, the way he handled it might be a problem.\n\nHe accessed her phone without her knowledge, even though she gave him the passcode. But using that access to check her WhatsApp, which they don't use, might be crossing a boundary. Even if he had the password, checking her private messages without her consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. However, maybe he had a reason to be suspicious, given that she had been reconnecting with someone she had blocked before. \n\nThen there's the timing of the breakup. She's in the hospital, dealing with possible health concerns. Adding the stress of a breakup could be seen as cruel. But if the author felt that the relationship was over due to her actions, maybe he couldn't fake it anymore. The question is whether it's wrong to end the relationship during such a vulnerable time. \n\nAlso, the author confronted her in front of her dad after the MRI, which he might have done to ensure she wasn't alone. That could be a thoughtful action. However, breaking up via Uber and sobbing might not have been the most sensitive approach. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was that she doesn't know why she did it, which might indicate a deeper issue. The author might be acting out of hurt and betrayal, but the method and timing are questionable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? On one hand, checking her phone without consent is a problem. On the other, if she was cheating, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, doing so during her hospitalization adds stress. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on privacy and relationship boundaries. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by checking her WhatsApp. Even with the passcode, accessing private messages without her knowing is a breach of trust. That could be the main point where he's in the wrong. Additionally, breaking up during her hospital stay might be insensitive, even if the reason is valid. So, the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he violated her privacy and the timing was inconsiderate.\n"
