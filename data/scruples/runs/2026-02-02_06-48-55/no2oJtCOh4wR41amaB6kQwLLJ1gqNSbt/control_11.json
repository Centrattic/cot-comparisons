We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves him discovering that she sent nudes to an ex she had blocked, even though they were together on those weekends. He broke up with her after finding out via her phone, which she gave him the passcode for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital with possible medical issues, so the timing is tough. Cheating is a serious issue in relationships, but the way he found out might matter. She gave him her phone passcode multiple times, which he used to access her WhatsApp. So he didn't hack into her phone, but she did willingly give him access. However, opening her messages without her consent could be a privacy issue. Even if she gave him the passcode, using it to check her WhatsApp without her knowing could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe man confronted her after getting her dad to relieve him, which shows he tried to handle it with some consideration. He was emotional and didn't yell, which might indicate he was hurt rather than just angry. However, breaking up with her while she's in the hospital, especially when she's already under stress from her health, could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if she was emotionally unfaithful, that's a major reason for a breakup. \n\nThe question is whether the timing and method make him the asshole. The fact that she was in the hospital adds complexity. If he had waited until she was better, maybe? But he couldn't fake it. Also, she admitted to not knowing why she did it, which might indicate she's not taking responsibility, but that's her side. \n\nSo, the main points are: Did he have the right to check her WhatsApp? Since she gave him her passcode, maybe he's in the gray area here. But using it to check her messages without her knowing is a privacy violation. Also, breaking up during a vulnerable time could be seen as cruel. However, the infidelity is a valid reason for a breakup. \n\nThe community might have mixed reactions. Some might say he's in the right because cheating is a deal-breaker, others might say he should have handled it differently and that the timing was wrong. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for the breakup itself. Since the cheating was real, but the method of discovery and timing might affect the answer. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the infidelity is a valid reason. But others might argue the method of discovery and the timing. However, according to the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit's common take, if the person did something that's a deal-breaker (cheating) and handled it as best they could under the circumstances, they might not be the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
