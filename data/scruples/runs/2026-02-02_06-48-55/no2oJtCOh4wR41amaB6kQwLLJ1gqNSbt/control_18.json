We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the person broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, even though they don't use that app. He discovered this by checking her phone after she gave him her passcode. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of breaking up during a hospital stay. That's tough because she's already dealing with health issues. It might add emotional stress at a time when she's vulnerable. But on the other hand, if there's been betrayal, like cheating, then the person might feel they can't continue the relationship. \n\nHe found out she was sending nudes to someone she had blocked before for being too flirty. She was doing this on weekends they were together. So, that's a breach of trust. Cheating is a major issue. However, the way he handled it\u2014reading her WhatsApp without asking\u2014might be a problem. Even if she gave him her passcode, using it to check her private messages without her consent could be an invasion of privacy. \n\nHe waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which is considerate. But breaking up while she's in the hospital could be seen as cruel. However, if he couldn't fake it anymore, maybe it's understandable. The key points are: was the breakup justified due to her actions, and was the method of handling it appropriate?\n\nCheating is a valid reason to break up, but the method of discovering it (without her knowledge) could be problematic. The stress of a hospital stay is added, so doing it then might be harsh. However, the author was in emotional distress and couldn't pretend anymore. \n\nSo, balancing the betrayal against the timing and method. The author might be in the wrong for invading her privacy, but the breakup reason is justified. The question is whether the timing makes him the asshole. The Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers both the validity of the action and the method. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong for checking her phone without permission, but the main issue is the cheating. However, breaking up during her hospitalization adds emotional stress. The answer might hinge on whether the cheating is a valid reason to break up, despite the timing. But since he waited until her dad was there and didn't confront her in a worse situation, maybe he's not the asshole. But the privacy invasion is a point against him. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong because of the privacy breach and the timing, or B because the cheating justifies it. It's tricky. I think the main issue is the method of discovering the cheating, which is a privacy violation. So, he's in the wrong for that. But the breakup itself might be justified. However, in AITA, they often look at both. So maybe answer A.\n"
