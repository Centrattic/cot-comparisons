We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend was in the hospital for possible health issues, and the boyfriend found out she was sending nudes to another guy through WhatsApp, which she wasn't even supposed to be using. He broke up with her after discovering this, right when she was already under stress from being hospitalized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy found out about her infidelity, which is a serious issue in a relationship. Cheating can be a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the timing is during her hospital stay, which could add emotional stress. The question is whether breaking up under these circumstances is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a breach of trust. If the guy discovered this and it's something he can't overlook, then ending the relationship might be justified. The fact that she was cheating on weekends they were together makes it more severe. The guy might feel betrayed and unable to continue.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up during a hospitalization could be seen as insensitive. She's already dealing with health issues, and adding the emotional turmoil of a breakup might not be considerate. However, the guy did wait until her dad was present and tried to handle it calmly, which shows he was trying to be respectful.\n\nThe guy also apologized for making her dad come over, which indicates he's aware that his actions might have added stress. The key here is whether the reason for the breakup (cheating) is valid enough to justify the timing. Since infidelity is a major issue, many would argue that the guy isn't wrong for ending the relationship, even if it's under difficult circumstances.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his actions. He looked through her phone without her permission, which might be seen as a privacy violation. However, he had her passcode, and she gave it to him multiple times. Still, using that to check her WhatsApp without her knowledge could be problematic. However, the discovery of cheating might mitigate that issue.\n\nIn the end, the decision to break up is his to make, and if the cheating was a deal-breaker, then it's a valid reason. The fact that he waited to confront her until after her dad arrived shows he tried to be thoughtful. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship, even though the timing is tough. The answer would be B (No), as he's not the asshole here.\n"
