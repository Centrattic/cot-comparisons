We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend was in the hospital with symptoms that could indicate a serious issue. The author discovered she was sending nudes to an ex on weekends they were together. He confronted her after the MRI and then broke up, leaving her with her dad.\n\nNow, considering the circumstances. Cheating or betrayal is a major issue in relationships. If she was indeed being unfaithful, that's a valid reason for breaking up. But the timing\u2014during a hospital stay\u2014adds complexity. The stress of medical issues is already high; adding a breakup could be seen as cruel. However, the author waited until she was with her dad and tried to be considerate. \n\nWas the act of checking her phone without permission justified? He had her passcode, but opening her WhatsApp without consent might be an invasion of privacy. That could be a factor in the argument. Also, the emotional impact on her during a vulnerable time is significant. \n\nBut then, if the relationship was built on trust, and she violated that trust, the breakup isn't necessarily the wrong choice. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the betrayal. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? It's a tough call. He did act on discovering infidelity, which is a deal-breaker for many. But doing so while she's in the hospital could be seen as insensitive. However, he did try to be supportive during her hospital stay before the breakup. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the infidelity is considered a valid reason despite the timing. If the infidelity is the main issue, then the breakup is justified. If the focus is on the emotional timing, maybe he's at fault. Since the user asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer could go either way. But given that cheating is a major violation, I lean towards the author not being the asshole. \n\nAnswer: B\n"
