We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The author found out she was sending nudes to someone she had blocked for being too flirty, even when they were together on weekends. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The relationship has been going on for three years, which is a substantial time. The girlfriend was in the hospital with symptoms that could be serious, like dizziness and weakness. The author, upon finding her phone, discovered the infidelity. He confronted her, then left, which added stress to her situation.\n\nNow, the main issue is the infidelity. Cheating or deceptive behavior can be a valid reason for breaking up, but the timing and method matter. The girlfriend was already in a vulnerable state due to her health. The author's decision to break up in the hospital might have been harsh, but it's important to consider if she was already unfaithful. \n\nBut wait, is sending nudes considered cheating? That depends on the relationship's boundaries. If the couple agreed to be exclusive and she violated that, then it's cheating. However, the author might have had different expectations. Also, the author had her phone passcode, which raises privacy concerns. Did she give it willingly? The author mentions she did, so maybe that's mutual. \n\nThe reaction: he waited until her dad was there, which shows he tried to be considerate. But still, breaking up when someone is in the hospital can add emotional stress. However, the girlfriend's actions might have been a betrayal. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the infidelity is a deal-breaker regardless of timing. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have acted impulsively. They were in a stressful situation, and he couldn't handle it, leading to an emotional decision. But if the infidelity occurred multiple times, it's a pattern. The girlfriend didn't have a good reason, just said she didn't know why. That could make the author's decision more understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend was indeed cheating, then the breakup is justified. However, the method of confronting her in the hospital might be questionable. But given the circumstances, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. Alternatively, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's actions are considered cheating. If they are, then the author is not in the wrong. If not, then maybe he is. But the description says she sent nudes to someone she blocked for being flirty, which seems like a breach of trust. So, the author might be justified in breaking up, but the timing could be seen as insensitive. However, the girlfriend's actions are the root cause. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's infidelity is a major issue, and the author had to make a decision. Even though the timing is tough, it's a valid reason for a breakup. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance. The author had access to her phone through shared passcode. Did that make it okay to check? That's a gray area. Some might say if you have the passcode, it's not a breach of privacy. Others might argue that even with the passcode, checking her messages is invasive. \n\nIn any case, the infidelity is a significant factor. If the girlfriend was unfaithful, the author has every right to end the relationship. The stress of the hospital situation is unfortunate, but the betrayal is the main issue. So, the answer is B.\n"
