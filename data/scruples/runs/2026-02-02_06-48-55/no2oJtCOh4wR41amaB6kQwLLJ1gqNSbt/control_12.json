We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital. The main issue is that he found out she was sending nudes to an ex via WhatsApp, which she had blocked before. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They've been dating for 3 years, and she's in the hospital with some medical issues. The author found out about the nudes while she was in the hospital. He waited until her dad was there to confront her and then left. \n\nNow, is breaking up during a time when she's already stressed because of her health the right move? It's definitely a tough call. On one hand, discovering betrayal is a big deal, and maybe he felt he couldn't handle the relationship anymore. On the other hand, she's in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time for her. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that she was sending nudes to someone she had previously blocked for being too flirty. The fact that it happened on weekends they were together might indicate dishonesty. The author might feel that this is a dealbreaker, especially if trust is a key component of the relationship. \n\nHowever, breaking up during a medical emergency could add significant stress to her. It's possible he acted out of hurt and betrayal, but maybe there was a more compassionate way to handle it. Still, the decision to end the relationship is his to make, especially if he feels the relationship can't continue. \n\nAlso, the author confronted her calmly, didn't yell, and made sure she wasn't alone by having her dad there. That seems considerate. The fact that he apologized for making her dad come over shows some level of thoughtfulness. \n\nThe question is whether the timing was wrong. Even if the infidelity is a valid reason to break up, doing it while she's in the hospital complicates things. But maybe the author couldn't hold it in and felt it was too hurtful to pretend everything was okay. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, it's tough because it adds stress during a hard time. However, if the relationship is based on trust and she violated that trust, then maybe ending it is justified. \n\nBut the question is if he's the asshole. The community might judge based on the timing and the impact on her health. However, others might argue that he's justified in ending the relationship due to betrayal. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (not the asshole) because the reason for breaking up is valid, even though the timing is poor. The author tried to handle it as compassionately as possible given the circumstances.\n"
