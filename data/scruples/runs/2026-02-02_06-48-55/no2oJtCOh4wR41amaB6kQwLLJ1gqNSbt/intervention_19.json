We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves the author discovering that his girlfriend was sending nudes to another guy over the past three months, even when they were together. He found out by checking her phone during her hospital stay and then broke up with her, causing her more stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital for a serious issue\u2014dizziness and weakness, which led to CT scans and MRIs. The author was there with her, which shows he was concerned and present. Then, he discovered her infidelity through her WhatsApp messages. The key points here are the infidelity and the timing of the breakup during her hospitalization.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for breaking up with her during her hospital stay? Well, infidelity is a major issue in relationships. If she was sending nudes to another guy while in a committed relationship, that's a betrayal. The author had a right to be upset and confront her. However, doing so while she's already under medical stress might be seen as cruel. The author mentions that he waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, which shows he tried to be considerate. But breaking up during a hospital stay could add significant emotional stress to her physical condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have waited until she was out of the hospital to have this conversation. But he found out during her hospitalization and couldn't fake being okay. The question is whether it's wrong to end a relationship over infidelity, even if it's while the partner is ill. Infidelity is a valid reason to end a relationship, so maybe the author isn't wrong in that regard. However, the timing might be questionable. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were clearly wrong, but the author's decision to break up during her hospital stay could be seen as adding insult to injury. However, the author did try to be supportive until the end and then left after confronting her. Also, the author was emotional and cried, showing he was hurt but made the decision out of pain rather than malice. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the girlfriend's infidelity is a valid reason for a breakup, but the timing during her hospitalization might make the author the asshole for adding stress to her situation. Alternatively, if the author can't fake being okay, then breaking up is understandable. The answer might depend on whether the infidelity justifies the timing of the breakup. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because the betrayal was significant. However, others might say that breaking up during hospitalization is inconsiderate regardless. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to weigh the circumstances.\n"
