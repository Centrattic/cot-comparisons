We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had medical issues, which is a critical factor. She was in the hospital, which is already a stressful time. The author found out she was sending nudes to another guy through WhatsApp, which she didn't usually use. The key points here are consent and context.\n\nThe author had the girlfriend's phone passcode and accessed her WhatsApp without her knowledge. Even though she gave him the passcode, using it to check her private messages might be a breach of trust. Privacy is important in relationships, but so is honesty. If she was having an emotional or physical affair, that's a deal-breaker for some people. However, the method of discovery\u2014without her consent\u2014could be problematic.\n\nBreaking up someone while they're in the hospital adds to their stress. The author waited until after the MRI and had her father there, which shows some consideration. But the timing of the breakup might still be seen as cruel because she's already dealing with health issues.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions (sending nudes to a blocked guy) could be considered a betrayal. The author felt the breakup was necessary, but the circumstances\u2014discovering it through her phone without her knowledge\u2014might put him in the wrong. However, the betrayal could also justify the breakup.\n\nSo, it's a tough call. If the author had confronted her about the guy first before checking her phone, maybe it would be different. But breaking up during her hospital stay might not be the best timing. The method of discovery and the context of the breakup are both factors here. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified given the betrayal, but the timing and method might make him the asshole.\n"
