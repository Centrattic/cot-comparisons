We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation involves discovering that the girlfriend was sending nudes to another guy she'd previously blocked for being too flirty. The key points here are the context of the breakup and the manner in which it was handled.\n\nFirst, the author found out about the infidelity while she was in the hospital. The girlfriend had reconnected with someone she blocked, sent nudes, and did this on weekends they were together. That seems like a betrayal. The author confronted her after she was done with the MRI, which might be a stressful time for her. They also involved her dad, which could be necessary for support but might add to the emotional toll.\n\nNow, the question is whether breaking up during hospitalization is wrong. The author was clearly hurt and couldn't fake being okay. The breakup itself is a response to a betrayal, which some might see as justified. However, doing it while she's already under medical stress is questionable. The timing and method of the breakup could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't at fault for being hurt and making a decision based on trust broken. On the other hand, breaking up someone during a vulnerable time when they're already stressed about their health might compound their stress. The author did try to handle it with some care by waiting until her dad was there and not yelling, but the timing is still a problem. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the betrayal justifies the timing. Since the reason is a major issue (infidelity), the author might not be the asshole. But the method of breaking up during a hospital stay could be seen as harsh. However, the user's options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Given that the core issue is betrayal, which is a valid reason to break up, but the timing might make it more hurtful. However, the author's actions are a response to a serious transgression. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
