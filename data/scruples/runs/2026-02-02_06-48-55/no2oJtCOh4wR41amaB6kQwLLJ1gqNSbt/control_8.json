We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. So first, I need to consider both sides of the story.\n\nThe author found out his girlfriend was sending nudes to someone else, which is definitely a betrayal. Cheating or infidelity is a serious issue in relationships and can be a valid reason to end things. However, the timing is right when she's in the hospital, which could add stress. The author confronted her calmly and then left, which might be seen as harsh given her vulnerable state.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions were dishonest and hurtful. The author had every right to feel betrayed. On the other hand, breaking up during a health crisis could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author didn't just leave abruptly; he made sure she was safe, waited for her dad to be there, and even apologized for involving her dad. That shows he was trying to handle it responsibly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship under these circumstances. Since the girlfriend was unfaithful, the author's decision might be justified. However, the act of breaking up during her hospitalization might be seen as insensitive. But considering the circumstances\u2014she gave him her phone, he discovered the infidelity, and handled it as soon as possible\u2014it's a tough call. \n\nIn many cases, cheating is considered a deal-breaker. The author's actions, while difficult, might be seen as a necessary step to protect his own well-being. So the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe some would say he should have waited until she was better, but others would support his decision given the betrayal. The key points are her actions and his handling of the situation. Overall, the answer is B.\n"
