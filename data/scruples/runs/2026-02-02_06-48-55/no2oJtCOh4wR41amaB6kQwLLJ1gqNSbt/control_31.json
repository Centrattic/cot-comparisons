We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after finding out she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a medical emergency with dizziness and weakness, leading to hospitalization. The author was with her, supporting her. Then, during a scan, he found out she was cheating by sending nudes to a guy she blocked for being too flirty. The author confronted her and broke up, which caused her more stress.\n\nCheating is a big deal in relationships. If she was having an emotional or physical affair, that's a betrayal. The author might feel justified in ending the relationship. However, timing is a factor here. She was already in the hospital, which is a stressful time. Breaking up during her hospital stay could add to her stress, especially if she's dealing with possible health issues. \n\nBut wait, the author waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which shows he tried to be considerate. He didn't yell and was emotional, which suggests he was hurt and trying to handle it gently. The girlfriend's response was to repeat she didn't know why she did it, which might indicate a lack of remorse or understanding, making reconciliation impossible. \n\nThe author's actions were driven by discovering infidelity, which many people consider a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the stress of a breakup during her medical situation might be seen as insensitive. But it's also important to consider the author's emotional state and the betrayal he experienced. He couldn't fake being okay with it. \n\nOn one hand, breaking up during a vulnerable time could be seen as harsh. On the other, cheating is a significant breach of trust. The author might not be in the wrong because the cheating is the core issue, and he had a right to end the relationship. However, some might argue that he should have waited until she was out of the hospital to avoid adding stress. \n\nBut since he tried to handle it as gently as possible given the circumstances, maybe it's not his fault. The decision to end the relationship is about the infidelity, not the timing. He's the one who discovered the cheating and had to make a tough choice. So, probably not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
