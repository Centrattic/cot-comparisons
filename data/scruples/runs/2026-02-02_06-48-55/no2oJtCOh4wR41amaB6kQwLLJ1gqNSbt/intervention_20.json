We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend was in the hospital for possible health issues, and the author found out through her phone that she had been sending nudes to someone from her past. The author waited until her dad was there before confronting her and then left, causing her more stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The breakup happened at a time when the girlfriend was already under stress due to her health. The act of looking at her phone without permission is a privacy violation, which is a big issue in relationships. Even if the author had her passcode, that doesn't make it okay. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and snooping can erode that trust immediately.\n\nNow, the author's reason for the breakup is infidelity or betrayal. If the girlfriend was sending nudes while they were supposedly in a committed relationship, that's a breach of trust. However, the timing of the breakup adds another layer. She's in the hospital, which is a vulnerable time. Some might argue that the author should have waited until she was in a better place physically before bringing up such a serious issue, while others might say that the betrayal justifies the immediate action, even if it's harsh.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author took a drastic step by ending the relationship during her hospital stay. They might have been right to feel hurt and betrayed, but acting on that emotion immediately in such a critical time could be seen as insensitive. The author also mentions feeling unable to fake it, which shows the depth of their hurt. However, the method of confrontation\u2014using her dad as a support figure and then leaving\u2014could have been handled more carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions themselves are questionable. Reconnecting with someone she had blocked and sending nudes during weekends they were together is a clear indication of dishonesty. If the relationship was based on mutual trust and communication, her actions would be a significant breach. The author's response, while perhaps poorly timed, is a reaction to that breach.\n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author's actions of snooping and then breaking up during her hospitalization might be seen as the problem. The girlfriend's actions are the cause, but the author's method of handling it could be the issue here. Breaking up in a hospital is not the best time to add stress, but the betrayal is valid. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the violation of privacy against the act of cheating.\n\nSo, the author violated her privacy by checking her WhatsApp, which is a major no-no. Even if they had the passcode, using it to look into her messages without consent is a breach. Then, using that information to break up while she's in a vulnerable state might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The girlfriend's actions were wrong, but the author's method of responding could also be criticized. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for both snooping and timing the breakup during her hospital stay.\n"
