We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend had health issues and was in the hospital. The author found out she was sending nudes to someone she was previously blocking for being \"too flirty,\" even when they were together. He broke up with her while she was in the hospital, which caused her more stress.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Cheating or infidelity is a major issue. If she was sending nudes to someone else, that's a breach of trust. The author discovered this through her phone, which might raise some privacy concerns, but she did give him her passcode, so maybe that's a gray area. However, the main point here is the breakup during hospitalization.\n\nBreaking up when someone is vulnerable, like in the hospital, can be seen as cruel. The author was in a stressful situation himself, finding out about the cheating, and the breakup adds stress to her. But on the other hand, the cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. The timing is questionable because she's already dealing with health issues. The author might have handled it differently, perhaps waiting until she was more stable physically and emotionally.\n\nThe author did try to be respectful by waiting until her dad was there and apologizing for involving him. He also left quickly to avoid making her feel worse. But the act of breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be seen as selfish, even if the reason is valid. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. The cheating is a legitimate reason, but the timing and method of the breakup might be seen as inconsiderate. The answer could depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say the cheating justifies the breakup regardless of timing, but others would argue that the hospital setting adds unnecessary stress. \n\nGiven that the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because of the timing, but some might argue B (No) due to the cheating. However, the key here is the act of breaking up during her hospitalization, which is a critical time for her. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
