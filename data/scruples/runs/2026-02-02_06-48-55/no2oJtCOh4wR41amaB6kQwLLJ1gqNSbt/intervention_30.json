We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out she was sending nudes to someone else while they were dating, which he found out by checking her phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, so if she was indeed having an emotional and physical affair through messages, that's a big deal. But here's the catch: he had access to her phone's passcode and went through her WhatsApp without her consent. Privacy is important. Even if he had the passcode, opening her private messages without her permission might be a violation of trust. \n\nBut wait, he says she gave him the passcode multiple times. So technically, she didn't keep it secret, which might complicate things. However, just because someone gives you a passcode doesn't automatically mean they're okay with you checking their personal messages. The passcode is for locking the device, not for accessing private apps. So maybe that's a point in his favor?\n\nThen there's the timing of the breakup. She's in the hospital, dealing with her own health issues. Breaking up at this time could add significant stress. But the author mentions he waited until her dad was there to support her. He also didn't confront her right away, which shows some consideration. However, the emotional impact of a breakup during a vulnerable time is hard to underestimate.\n\nThe guy's actions: He found out about the cheating, confronted her, then left. He apologized for making her dad leave. He's not yelling or being aggressive, just emotional. The question is whether breaking up during her hospitalization is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, lying and cheating are serious. She was unfaithful, which justifies a breakup. On the other hand, doing so when she's already under stress might be cruel. But if he had waited until she was better, would that have been better? Maybe, but he couldn't \"fake it\" anymore. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have the right to check her phone? Was the breakup justified? Was the timing appropriate? \n\nIf she was cheating, then the breakup is understandable. However, the method of finding out (without her consent) might be questionable. Even if he had the passcode, checking private messages could be seen as invasive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy's actions are a mix. He was wrong to check her phone without her consent, but he's not wrong for breaking up due to cheating. However, the timing and method of the breakup could be debated. \n\nBut the question is, is the author in the wrong? The main issue is the breakup during her hospital stay. Some might argue that it's not his fault she cheated, and he's justified in ending the relationship. Others might say he should have waited until she was better. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the privacy violation and the breakup timing, but others might side with B. However, given that cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, maybe it's not entirely his fault. Wait, but the main question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up while she's in the hospital. If the reason is justified (cheating), then maybe he's not in the wrong. The privacy part is a separate issue. \n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the key is that the author had the right to end the relationship, but the method (privacy violation) is wrong. However, the question is about the breakup, not the phone checking. So if the AITA is about breaking up during hospitalization due to valid reasons, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might say it's cruel to break up when someone is unwell. \n\nThis is tricky. I need to decide if the act of breaking up under these circumstances makes him the asshole. If the reason is cheating, which is a valid reason, then the breakup isn't wrong. However, using the hospital time to do so might be seen as adding insult to injury. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of the timing, but B (he's not in the wrong) because of the cheating. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up while she's in the hospital, not about the phone checking. \n\nI think the answer is A for Yes, he's in the wrong, because breaking up during such a vulnerable time is cruel, even if she cheated. However, others might argue it's justified. But given the emotional stress, maybe the right answer is A.\n"
