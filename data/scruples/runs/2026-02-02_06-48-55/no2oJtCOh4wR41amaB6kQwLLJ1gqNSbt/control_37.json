We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to another guy. The answer needs to be either A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for almost three years. The girlfriend was in the hospital for symptoms that could be serious (like a stroke), and the author found out she was cheating via WhatsApp messages. He broke up with her during her hospital stay.\n\nThe key points here are the timing of the breakup and the circumstances of the infidelity. On one hand, breaking up someone while they're already stressed and in the hospital could add emotional strain, which is arguably inconsiderate. On the other hand, discovering cheating is a major betrayal, and the author might feel that continuing the relationship under such circumstances is impossible.\n\nHowever, the situation is complicated. The author found out during a vulnerable time for his girlfriend. Even though the infidelity is a valid reason to break up, doing so while she's hospitalized could be seen as adding to her stress. The question is whether the timing was inappropriate. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the validity of the reason (cheating) and the timing (when she's in the hospital). Cheating is generally considered a valid reason to end a relationship. However, breaking up someone when they're unwell could be seen as harsh. However, the author waited until after the MRI and before confronting her, which shows some consideration. He also made sure her dad was there to support her. \n\nSo, while the timing is questionable, the reason is justified. The author might not be in the wrong because the infidelity is a major issue. However, some might argue that the breakup during her hospital stay is insensitive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the infidelity is a valid reason, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance here.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether breaking up during this time is considered wrong. Some might say he should have waited until she was out of the hospital. However, given the betrayal, others might say he had the right to end the relationship immediately. The Reddit community often has mixed responses, but in AITA scenarios, if the person has a valid reason, they're less likely to be the asshole. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
