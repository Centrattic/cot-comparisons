We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a medical emergency\u2014dizziness, weakness in limbs. They were in the hospital, and the author found out she was sending nudes to a guy she had blocked before, even when they were together. He confronted her and then broke up with her. Now, the question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, cheating or betrayal is a huge issue in relationships. If she was sending nudes to someone else while in a committed relationship, that's a violation of trust. The author found out through her phone, which might be a privacy issue, but she gave him the passcode. Maybe that's where the gray area is. Did he have the right to check her WhatsApp? If she gave him the code, maybe he felt justified, but it's still a bit of a privacy violation. However, if she was being unfaithful, that's a deal-breaker for some people.\n\nThen there's the timing of the breakup. She's in the hospital, dealing with potential health issues. Breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be seen as cruel. The author left her while she's already stressed about her health. Even if he felt betrayed, the timing might not be ideal. But maybe he couldn't handle the emotional burden anymore, which is understandable.\n\nSo the author is in a tough spot. He discovered betrayal, which is a valid reason to break up, but doing so when she's unwell might be considered insensitive. The fact that he waited for her dad to be there before confronting her shows he tried to be considerate, but leaving immediately after might add to her stress. There's a mix of valid reasons and questionable timing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was built on trust and she violated that, ending it makes sense. The author might feel that pretending everything is okay isn't possible. But is it fair to dump someone when they're already dealing with health issues? That's a tricky balance. The answer would depend on whether the breakup was necessary regardless of timing, or if the timing made it worse.\n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because breaking up during a medical crisis could be seen as adding insult to injury. However, the cheating aspect is a valid reason. But the main issue is the timing and the stress it adds to her. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the circumstances of the breakup even though the reason is valid.\n"
