We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend during her hospital stay is in the wrong. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together for almost three years. The girlfriend ends up in the hospital with symptoms like dizziness and weakness, which could be serious. The author goes to the hospital, stays with her, and then later finds out she was sending nudes to an ex on WhatsApp, which she had blocked before. The author discovers this when her phone goes off during an MRI, and he checks it using her passcode. Then he breaks up with her while she's in the hospital, which adds stress to her situation.\n\nFirst, the cheating aspect: if she was indeed sending nudes to another guy while in a committed relationship, that's a breach of trust. Cheating or infidelity is a major issue in relationships and often a deal-breaker for many people. The fact that she was doing this on weekends they were together makes it even more serious because it shows deceit. However, the author had a valid reason to end the relationship due to betrayal.\n\nNow, the timing of the breakup is during her hospital stay. The question is whether breaking up at that moment is wrong. The hospitalization is a stressful time for her, and adding the emotional trauma of a breakup could be seen as cruel. But the author might have felt unable to fake being okay with the situation, which is understandable. People react differently to betrayal; some might feel they can't stay in the relationship even if it means causing more stress when the other person is vulnerable.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't confront her immediately but waited until her dad was there. That shows some consideration for her not being alone during the confrontation. He also apologized for involving her dad, which is a good move. However, the emotional impact of a breakup in such a context is significant. The stress of being in the hospital combined with the breakup could have negative effects on her health, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut the author's actions were in response to betrayal. The question is whether the timing was appropriate. Some might argue that the betrayal justifies the breakup regardless of when it happens. Others might say that the worst possible time to break up is when someone is already dealing with health issues. The author's emotional state (crying) and the fact that he couldn't continue the relationship despite the timing might be seen as understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is wrong in breaking up during her hospitalization because it adds unnecessary stress, but he's right in ending the relationship over cheating. However, the question is specifically about whether he is in the wrong. Since the situation involves a mutual decision to end due to betrayal, but the timing is questionable, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because breaking up during a vulnerable time could be seen as insensitive, even if the reason is valid. Alternatively, B (not the wrong) because cheating is a legitimate reason to end a relationship regardless of timing.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author was in a situation where he found out about the infidelity and couldn't keep up the pretense. The act of breaking up during hospitalization adds to her stress, which is a valid concern. However, the cheating is a major factor. The decision to dump her while she's in the hospital is the crux. While the cheating is justified as a reason to end, the timing is questionable. However, since the author felt he couldn't fake it, maybe it's more about his emotional response. But others might argue that he could have waited until she was stable. Considering all factors, the answer is likely A because the timing is inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid.\n"
