We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves the girlfriend reconnecting with someone she had blocked before, sending nudes, and the author finding out via her phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in the hospital, which is already a stressful time. The author found out about her infidelity or at least inappropriate behavior through her phone. The key points here are consent and the circumstances of the breakup.\n\nThe author was given her phone and her passcode, which might make the act of checking her WhatsApp less about breaking trust and more about using the phone as she gave it to him. However, even if she gave her phone to him, is opening her WhatsApp without her knowledge a breach of privacy? That's a gray area. Some might argue that if she gave her phone and passcode, he had access, but others might say that she didn't intend for him to look through her private messages.\n\nThen there's the act of breaking up while she's hospitalized. Timing is important here. She's already stressed about her health, and adding a breakup could exacerbate her stress. But the author felt emotionally hurt and couldn't fake it anymore. Is it wrong to prioritize his own emotional well-being? However, breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be seen as heartless.\n\nThe girlfriend admitted to sending nudes to someone she was advised to avoid, which is a betrayal of trust. The author confronting her after the MRI and then leaving might be justified if he felt the relationship was over, but doing so while she's in the hospital adds to the emotional impact.\n\nThe key factors are the justification for the breakup (infidelity) and the timing. If the author had broken up with her earlier, maybe it's different. But doing so when she's already dealing with health issues might be seen as harsh. However, if the betrayal was significant enough, some might argue it's justified.\n\nAlso, the author didn't yell, tried to be respectful, and apologized to her dad. These actions might mitigate the severity of the situation. But the method of finding out through her phone could be seen as a breach of trust, even if she gave him the passcode. \n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether the author's actions were necessary given the betrayal and the timing. There's no clear right or wrong, but some might say the author is not in the wrong because the betrayal was significant. Others might say breaking up during her hospital stay was insensitive. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the betrayal justifies the breakup despite the timing. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the timing was too harsh. But given the context of infidelity, many might side with B.\n"
