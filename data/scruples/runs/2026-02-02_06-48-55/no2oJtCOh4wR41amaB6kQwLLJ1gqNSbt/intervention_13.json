We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation involves him finding out about her sending nudes to someone she blocked for being flirty, even when they were together on weekends. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The relationship has been three years, which is a significant amount of time. The girlfriend is in the hospital with symptoms like dizziness and weakness, which sounds serious. The author went to the hospital after work, spent the night, and during that time, saw her phone with the passcode. He checked her WhatsApp, found the messages, and then confronted her after her dad arrived.\n\nThe main issue here is the act of checking her phone without her consent. Even though she gave him the passcode multiple times, that doesn't mean she intended for him to check her private messages. Privacy is crucial in relationships, and using her passcode to access WhatsApp, which they don't normally use, could be a breach of that trust.\n\nThen, breaking up during a hospital stay adds to the stress. The girlfriend is already dealing with health concerns, and the breakup might not be the best timing. But the author says he couldn't fake it, so maybe he felt the infidelity was too much to handle even in that situation.\n\nIs it valid to break up over this? Cheating or betrayal is a common reason for breakups. However, the method here isn't clear. If she was actually cheating by sharing nudes, then it's a valid reason. But if she just sent them to someone she was reconnecting with, maybe without explicit intent to betray, it's more complicated. The author's actions of invading her privacy without asking are problematic regardless.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used the dad to relay the message and then left right after might show that he considered her well-being. However, the initial breach of privacy is a red flag. People have different boundaries, and checking her messages without explicit permission might be seen as overstepping, even if he had a reason.\n\nSo the author is in the wrong because of the privacy violation. Even if the content of the messages was a reason to break up, the way he discovered them (without her consent) makes him the asshole. The breakup timing is bad, but the main issue is the lack of trust and respect in how he found out.\n"
