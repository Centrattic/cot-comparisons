We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is the asshole for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The main points are: they've been dating for nearly three years, the girlfriend is in the hospital with possible health issues, the author discovered she was sending nudes to a guy she previously blocked, and then he broke up with her right there.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is already under stress from being hospitalized. The author found out about the cheating through her phone, which he accessed without her consent. Even though she gave him the passcode, using it to check her WhatsApp might be a privacy invasion. The act of opening WhatsApp and looking through her messages without her knowledge is a breach of trust. Then, he confronted her in the hospital, which could add to her emotional distress during a time when she's physically unwell. Breaking up in such a situation might not be fair to her, considering her current state.\n\nOn the other hand, betrayal is a significant issue. If she was indeed cheating, the author has a right to be hurt and possibly end the relationship. However, the timing\u2014while she's in the hospital\u2014raises questions about his approach. He could have handled it in a way that minimizes her stress, maybe after she's recovered a bit. Also, using her father to mediate and then leaving immediately might not have been the most supportive way to handle it.\n\nThe author admits to being an asshole in parts, which shows self-awareness. But the key here is whether breaking up under these circumstances was wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the discovery was valid (if she actually cheated) and how he handled the breakup. Since he broke up while she's vulnerable, it's possible he's in the wrong for not considering her health, regardless of the betrayal. However, the betrayal itself is a valid reason to break up. The conflict is between the right to privacy and the right to leave a relationship due to infidelity. \n\nIn many cases, cheating is a justified reason to end a relationship. However, the method and timing are questionable. Breaking up during a medical crisis could be seen as cruel. So the author might be in the wrong for how he handled it, not necessarily the decision itself. The fact that he couldn't fake being okay and had to leave immediately might show that he wasn't handling it well. Also, using her father to step in adds complexity. \n\nAnother angle: by checking her phone without her consent, he violated her privacy. That's a problem regardless of the discovery. If he had confronted her without spying, he might have had a different outcome. But since he spied, that could make him partially at fault for the infidelity discovery. However, the cheating is a separate issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions\u2014spying and breaking up in the hospital\u2014might make him the asshole. The timing and method of the breakup are questionable, even if the reason (cheating) is valid. So the answer is A.\n"
