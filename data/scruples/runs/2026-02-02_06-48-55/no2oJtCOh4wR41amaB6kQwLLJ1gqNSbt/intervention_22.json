We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend was in the hospital with possible health issues\u2014dizziness, weakness in limbs. That's serious. The author found out through her phone that she was sending nudes to a guy she previously blocked for being too flirty, even when they were together. The author confronted her and then left, causing her more stress.\n\nNow, infidelity or betrayal is a major issue in relationships. If she was indeed cheating, that's a valid reason to break up. However, the timing is during her hospitalization. The author could have waited until she was out of the hospital to discuss it, maybe to minimize her stress. But he chose to confront her right then, which might have added emotional strain during a vulnerable time.\n\nBut wait, the author says she sent nudes to someone else while they were together. Even if it's not a physical affair, it's emotional betrayal. The author discovered this through her phone, which might be questionable in terms of privacy. However, she gave him her passcode multiple times, so maybe he had a right to access it. \n\nThe key points: Is the breakup justified because of her actions, or was it wrong to do so while she's in the hospital? On one hand, the author is hurt and dealing with betrayal. On the other hand, she's already under medical stress. The author might have made her emotional state worse. \n\nBut the question is whether he's the asshole. The act of breaking up because of infidelity is understandable. However, timing could be considered inconsiderate. But given the context, maybe it's justified. The author did try to be calm, waited for her dad to be there, and then left. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the infidelity is a valid reason, then no. The method of breaking up during her hospital stay might be harsh, but it's not necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the reason for breaking up is justified, even if the timing was tough. Alternatively, maybe A because of the timing. \n\nBut the story says she was sending nudes to someone else, which is a breach of trust. Even if he could have waited, the reason for the breakup is valid. So the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for breaking up over betrayal, even if the timing was stressful for her.\n"
