We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to another guy. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author found out about the nudes through her phone, which she gave him the passcode for. He waited until she was stable and her dad was there to talk to her, then broke up with her. He felt it was a reason to end the relationship, but he's questioning if it's valid given the timing and her medical situation.\n\nOn one hand, finding out about infidelity or betrayal is a major issue. If she was sending nudes to another guy while they were together, that's a breach of trust. The author might feel justified in ending the relationship. However, doing so while she's in the hospital adds a layer of stress and potential inconsideration. The question is whether it's appropriate to end a relationship under such circumstances, even if there's a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the author accessed her phone without her knowledge, which is a privacy violation. Even though she gave him the passcode, using that to check her WhatsApp without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. That action might have been the catalyst for the breakup, but it's questionable if that's the right approach. Additionally, breaking up during a medical emergency could be seen as insensitive, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were clearly wrong, but the author's method of handling it might be the problem. The breakup itself might be justified, but the timing and method could make the author the asshole. However, if the author felt the betrayal was unforgivable, he might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship, even if the timing was tough.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the violation of privacy through checking her phone and the timing of the breakup. If the author had confronted her about the phone access first, maybe the situation would be different. But since he used that information to break up with her during her hospital stay, it's possible he's in the wrong for the method, even if the reason is valid. So I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
