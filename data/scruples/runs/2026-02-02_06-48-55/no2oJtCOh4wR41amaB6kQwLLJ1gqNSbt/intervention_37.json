We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author found out their girlfriend was being unfaithful by sending nudes to someone she had blocked before for being too flirty. They did this despite being in a 3-year relationship and the author regularly complimenting her. The girlfriend was in the hospital, which adds a layer of sensitivity.\n\nThe author broke up with her during this vulnerable time, which could be seen as harsh. However, betrayal through infidelity is a significant reason people end relationships. The author might have felt they couldn't fake it anymore, even with her hospitalized. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend was already under stress from her health issues. Ending the relationship while she's in the hospital could add to her emotional distress. The author did wait until her dad was there before confronting her, which is thoughtful, but the timing is still questionable. \n\nSome might argue that the author is justified in ending the relationship due to the betrayal. Others might think that the timing\u2014during hospitalization\u2014was inconsiderate. The fact that the girlfriend's actions included lying (since she was sending nudes when they were together) adds to the betrayal.\n\nHowever, the author's immediate reaction was to break up without giving her a chance to explain, even if the explanation was vague (\"doesn't know why\"). The emotional impact of breaking up in such a situation could be severe. \n\nI'm torn. On one hand, cheating is a valid reason to end things. On the other, doing so while she's hospitalized might be seen as insensitive. The author's actions were driven by hurt and betrayal, but the timing was inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's decision was justified despite the timing. Since the betrayal is significant, maybe they're not the asshole. But the way it was handled adds stress during a health crisis. \n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions were justified. Maybe it's a judgment call. Some would say it's a valid reason to break up, others say the timing was bad. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the act of breaking up during hospitalization is considered the wrong, then A. If the reason (cheating) justifies it, then B. \n\nIn many cases, infidelity is grounds for breaking up, even if it's not the most considerate time. However, the author could have waited until she was stable to end things. But they were in the moment, overwhelmed. Maybe B is the answer here. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong because they added emotional distress during a medical crisis. \n\nI think the key is that while the infidelity is a valid reason, the timing and method of breaking up could be seen as insensitive. However, the cheating is a major issue. It's a tough call. In some perspectives, the author is justified. In others, not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on the severity of the betrayal versus the timing. \n\nI think the majority would say the author isn't in the wrong because the infidelity is a significant breach. However, others might argue the timing was poor. Given the options, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. But if the community leans more on the timing being inconsiderate, then A. \n\nBut in the Reddit context, sometimes people are more lenient if the betrayal is severe. Since the girlfriend was sending nudes, which is a form of emotional cheating or infidelity, the author's reaction is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
