We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital. They've been together for almost three years. The girlfriend was admitted after experiencing dizziness and weakness, which led to tests. The author was there with her, and during the MRI, he found out she was sending nudes to a guy she had blocked before because he was too flirty. She did this on weekends they were together, according to him.\n\nHe confronted her after the MRI, then left, and hasn't talked to her since. He apologized to her dad for causing him to leave. Now, he's wondering if breaking up during her hospital stay was wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cheating aspect. If she was indeed sending nudes to another guy while in a relationship, that's a serious breach of trust. Cheating is a common reason people break up, so from that standpoint, the author might feel justified. However, the context here is that she's in the hospital, which adds another layer. Breaking up during a time of vulnerability could be seen as cruel, even if the reason is valid.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that he waited until her dad was there before confronting her. He didn't yell, just cried and asked why. So he tried to be considerate about her not being alone. However, leaving immediately after might have added to her stress, which is bad given her health issues. The question is whether the timing was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been emotionally overwhelmed. Discovering infidelity is traumatic, and the stress of the hospital situation might have made it harder to handle. People react differently under stress, and some might not be able to fake their feelings to stay for longer.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014reconnecting with a guy she blocked for being too flirty and sending nudes\u2014could be considered as cheating, even if it's not physical. Emotional infidelity is still cheating for some people. The fact that she was doing this on weekends they were together suggests dishonesty, which could justify the breakup.\n\nBut the key issue here is timing. Breaking up when someone is already in the hospital is sensitive. It might cause additional emotional distress when they need support. The author might be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state. However, if the relationship was already irreparable due to her actions, maybe the breakup was necessary regardless of timing.\n\nAnother angle: the author discovered her phone messages without her knowledge? Wait, he says she gave him her passcode multiple times because he has bad memory. So he used her phone with her knowledge when she asked him to hold it. He didn't hack into it. So maybe that's not a violation. If she gave him the passcode, he had access. So he's not at fault for checking the phone.\n\nBut the fact that she had a WhatsApp account they didn't use for communication might be a red flag. Maybe she kept it secret, which could be part of the cheating. However, the author's action of checking the phone isn't necessarily wrong if she gave him access. So that part might not be his fault.\n\nNow, the main question: is breaking up during her hospitalization wrong? If the reason is legitimate, then it's a valid breakup. However, the timing could be seen as insensitive. But if the author couldn't fake being okay, then it's understandable. People can't force themselves to stay in a relationship if they're hurt.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" factor, the author is being honest about his feelings. Cheating is a dealbreaker for many, so the author isn't the asshole for ending the relationship. However, the timing could be seen as harsh. But since the reason is valid, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo weighing all factors: the cheating is a valid reason, he tried to be considerate by having her dad there, and he couldn't fake it. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
