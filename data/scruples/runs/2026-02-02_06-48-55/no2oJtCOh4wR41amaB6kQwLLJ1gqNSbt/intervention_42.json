We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The story says the guy found out she was sending nudes to an ex over three months. He broke up with her right there in the hospital.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was already stressed from being hospitalized. The guy found out about the cheating, which is a big deal. But the context matters. He used her phone without asking, which is a privacy issue. Even though she gave him her passcode before, using it to check her WhatsApp without her permission might be a breach of trust on his part too. \n\nThen, the breakup happened in the hospital. That's a really tough time for her. She's dealing with her health issues, and now this emotional blow. The guy left her with her dad, but she's still in a vulnerable state. Even if the cheating is valid, the timing and the way he handled it might not be the best. \n\nOn the other hand, the cheating is a legitimate reason to break up. The fact that she was doing it while they were together on weekends shows a lack of commitment. The guy felt hurt and couldn't fake it anymore. But breaking up in the hospital adds more stress, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? He did break up with her in a sensitive time, which could be seen as cruel. However, the cheating is a valid reason. The privacy issue (checking her phone without consent) might also play a role here. If he had found out through legitimate means, maybe the situation is different, but invading her privacy could be his fault. \n\nBut the main question is about the breakup timing. Even if the cheating is valid, the way and when he broke up with her could make him the asshole. The hospital is not the right place for such a confrontation. So, the author is in the wrong because of the method and timing, even if the reason is justified. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
