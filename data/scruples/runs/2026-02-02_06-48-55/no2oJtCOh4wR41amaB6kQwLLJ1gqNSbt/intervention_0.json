We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital after discovering she was sending nudes to someone else. \n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend is in the hospital with possible serious health issues. The author found out she was cheating via WhatsApp messages, which he accessed without her permission. He then broke up with her while she was vulnerable.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the author has valid reasons to end the relationship. However, the timing is sensitive. She's in the hospital, which adds stress and isn't the ideal time for a breakup. But the author might feel he couldn't fake it anymore. \n\nPrivacy is another angle. He used her phone with her passcode. Even if she gave him the code, opening WhatsApp without her knowledge could be a privacy violation. That might contribute to the wrongness of his actions.\n\nEmotional impact: Breaking up during a health crisis could add to her stress. But the author is also hurt and might not be able to pretend. The girlfriend's actions were dishonest, which complicates things.\n\nLegal aspects? Not really applicable here unless there's a breach of privacy laws, but that's probably too much. More about moral and ethical considerations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did find out about cheating, which is a valid reason. However, the method of discovering it (checking her phone without permission) and the timing (hospital) are questionable. The fact that she was unfaithful is a major point against her, but the author's actions in terms of privacy and timing might make him partially at fault.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. Since cheating is a legitimate reason, even if the timing is bad, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he discovered it (privacy violation) could argue for him being wrong. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, maybe because of the context of her being in the hospital.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author's response is a reaction to betrayal, which is understandable. But the method of handling it (checking her phone) is questionable. However, the core of the question is about the breakup itself, not the means of finding out. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because cheating is a valid reason, even if timing is rough. But if the user thinks he should have waited, then maybe A. \n\nI think the main factor is whether the breakup was justified. Since cheating is a valid reason, even if done in a hospital, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the privacy aspect complicates things. But the question is about the breakup itself. So the answer is B.\n"
