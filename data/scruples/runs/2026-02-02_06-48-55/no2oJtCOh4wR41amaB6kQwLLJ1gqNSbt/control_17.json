We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital after finding out she was sending nudes to another guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was in the hospital for a serious reason\u2014dizziness and weakness, which could indicate something like a stroke or other neurological issue. The author was with her, taking care of her, and then discovered infidelity through her WhatsApp messages. The breakup happened just as she was undergoing medical tests and procedures.\n\nNow, the key points here: The girlfriend was in a vulnerable state, both physically and emotionally. The author found out about her actions, which clearly caused him emotional distress. But breaking up during such a critical time might add to her stress, which could be harmful. However, the act of sending nudes and seeking validation from another person while in a committed relationship is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author confronted her calmly and then left, which might be seen as necessary if the relationship had lost its foundation. However, the timing is questionable. The girlfriend was already dealing with health issues, and the breakup could exacerbate her stress, potentially affecting her recovery. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he couldn't fake being okay anymore. The question is whether breaking up during her hospitalization is inconsiderate. Some might argue that the truth should be told, but the method and timing are important. Others might say that the infidelity is a valid reason to end the relationship, regardless of timing.\n\nBut the main ethical consideration here is the impact on her health. Medical professionals often advise against unnecessary stress during hospitalization. So, even though the infidelity is a valid reason, breaking up in that context could be seen as adding harm. The author tried to handle it with some care by involving her dad, but the situation is still sensitive.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or could cause undue harm. Here, the author's actions might be seen as necessary for his own well-being and the relationship's integrity, but the timing could be questioned. However, the girlfriend's actions (sending nudes while in a relationship) are arguably the initial wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the timing of the breakup was the wrong choice. If the author had waited until she was stable, it might have been kinder. But given the circumstances, he might feel he couldn't wait. The community might split, but leaning towards the author not being the asshole because the infidelity is a valid reason, even if the timing is tough. So answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
