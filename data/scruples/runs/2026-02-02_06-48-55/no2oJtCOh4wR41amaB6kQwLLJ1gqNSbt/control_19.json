We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the girlfriend was admitted to the hospital with symptoms that could be serious. The boyfriend found out she was sending nudes to someone she previously blocked for being too flirty, even when they were together on weekends. He broke up with her while she was in the hospital, which added stress to her situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of breaking up someone when they're vulnerable. Hospitals are stressful places, and breaking up during such a time could be seen as cruel. But on the other hand, the boyfriend discovered infidelity or betrayal, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship. However, the method of breaking up\u2014while she's unwell\u2014might be questionable.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend admitted he was an asshole in parts. He snooped through her phone, which is a breach of privacy. Using her passcode to access her WhatsApp, finding out about the messages, that's something that could be controversial. Even if the content was inappropriate, he had no right to invade her privacy without a discussion first.\n\nThen, breaking up during her hospital stay adds emotional stress when she's already dealing with health issues. Even though the breakup itself is a personal decision, the timing might be considered insensitive. However, if the relationship was already in trouble because of her actions, maybe it's a necessary but harsh decision.\n\nBut the key points here: snooping is a violation of trust. If he had confronted her about the behavior before this incident, it might have been handled differently. Breaking up during a time when she's physically vulnerable could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he waited until her dad was there to support her is a positive, but the act of breaking up while she's in the hospital is still questionable.\n\nSo, considering the privacy breach and the timing of the breakup, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, the betrayal by the girlfriend is a significant factor. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the actions of the girlfriend are part of the context. The main issues are the privacy invasion and the timing of the breakup. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for breaking up during her hospitalization and for snooping, but it's a nuanced situation. However, given the parameters of the question, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
