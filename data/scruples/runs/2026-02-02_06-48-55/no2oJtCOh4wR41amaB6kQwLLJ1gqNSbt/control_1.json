We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves him finding out she sent nudes to someone she was supposed to be blocking, even on weekends they were together. He confronted her and broke up after she didn't give a satisfactory explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was in the hospital, which is a stressful time. The author discovered her infidelity through WhatsApp messages when they don't use the app. She had a history of reconnecting with this guy, who was previously blocked for flirting. The author waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which might be a good move to avoid her being alone. But breaking up in the hospital... That's harsh. \n\nNow, the main question is about whether he's in the wrong. The ethical angle here is about the decision to break up during a vulnerable time. Even if she did something wrong, doing it while she's already dealing with health issues could add unnecessary stress. But the other side is, if there's a breach of trust, it's valid to end the relationship. However, the method and timing are questionable. \n\nHe found out through her phone, which she gave him the passcode. So that's not a breach of privacy. But maybe using that information in a hospital setting is inconsiderate. Also, she didn't seem to have a good reason, just that she doesn't know why. The author was emotional, crying, which shows he's hurt. But the breakup timing\u2014immediately after discovering this during her stay\u2014might be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, infidelity is a major issue. If she was sending nudes to someone while in a committed relationship, that's a violation. But the context is important. She was in the hospital, which is a place where people are already stressed and vulnerable. Breaking up there could exacerbate her condition, both physically and mentally. \n\nSo, the author might be justified in ending the relationship due to her actions, but the timing and method are problematic. The key factors are: 1) Validity of the reason for breakup (cheating), 2) The setting (hospital adds stress), 3) The approach (confronting her in front of her dad, then leaving).\n\nIn AITA discussions, people often consider both the reason and the manner. Even if the reason is justified, the manner might make it look like the asshole. But in this case, the reason is pretty strong. However, breaking up in the hospital is seen as adding insult to injury. So, maybe the author is not the asshole, but his method is questionable. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the breakup was appropriate given the circumstances. The girlfriend's actions are clearly wrong (cheating), so the author has grounds. However, breaking up in the hospital might be seen as heartless. The AITA community often looks at the timing and the stress caused. \n\nSo, considering the hospital setting and her possible health issues, even if he's right about the cheating, the timing of the breakup might make him the asshole. The answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the hospital isn't the right place for such a decision. Or B (No) if the reason is strong enough. \n\nBut in the post, he does mention that he waited for her dad to be there, which shows he cared about her safety. He also apologized for making her dad come. The core issue is the cheating. However, the hospital adds a layer of insensitivity. So, the answer might be A. But the AITA community sometimes splits here. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is just asking if the author is in the wrong, and the reason is valid (cheating), but the timing is bad, maybe the answer is A because of the method, even if the reason is justified. But some might argue that the reason is more important. \n\nI think the key here is that breaking up in the hospital is adding to her stress. While the cheating is bad, the way he handled it might be worse. But he didn't confront her immediately. He waited until her dad was there. So maybe B. But the breakup happened while she was in a vulnerable state. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards A, because breaking up someone in the hospital seems like a low point for such a decision. Even if she's done wrong, the author's choice to leave her during her time of need is the asshole part. The fact that he was with her, then left after confrontation, might be seen as selfish. So the answer would be A.\n"
