We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves discovering she sent nudes to another guy, which he found out by looking at her phone. \n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered a betrayal, and breaking up over that is often seen as justified. However, the timing here is while she's in the hospital. That adds a layer of stress for her. The author found out during her hospital stay, which might have been a vulnerable time for her. \n\nThe author mentions they've been together for three years, and the girlfriend sent nudes to someone she had previously blocked. The fact that she did this on weekends they were together suggests it was while in the relationship, which is a clear breach of trust. The author found out by checking her phone, which he had her passcode for. Using the passcode to access her phone without permission could be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if it's understandable given the situation.\n\nBreaking up during her hospitalization might add to her stress. The author waited until her dad was there, which shows some consideration for her emotional state. However, the act of breaking up during a medical crisis could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, the author was clearly hurt and couldn't fake it anymore. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were deceitful, and the author had a right to feel betrayed. The question is whether breaking up during her hospital stay was wrong. It's a tough call because while the cheating is a valid reason, the timing might be inconsiderate. However, the author's actions were prompted by a betrayal, which is a significant factor. The answer might hinge on whether the infidelity is considered a valid reason that outweighs the timing.\n"
