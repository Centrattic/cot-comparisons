We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation is pretty detailed. So, the girlfriend had health issues, was in the hospital, and the boyfriend found out she was sending nudes to another guy. He broke up with her while she was there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend was already in a stressful situation with her health, and the breakup might add to her stress. Breaking up during a vulnerable time could be seen as insensitive. But on the other hand, the boyfriend discovered infidelity or betrayal through her actions. He waited until her dad was there, tried to be calm, and didn't yell. He also apologized for involving her dad. \n\nThe question is whether the breakup was justified. Cheating or sending explicit photos to someone else while in a relationship is generally considered a betrayal. The boyfriend might feel that this is a deal-breaker. However, doing so while she's in the hospital could be seen as cruel timing. But he might not have been able to fake it anymore, as he mentioned. \n\nThe key points are: the reason for the breakup (betrayal) and the timing (during hospitalization). The validity of the reason might outweigh the timing. People have different values, but if someone is unfaithful, many would see the other person as justified in ending the relationship. However, timing can affect how it's perceived. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, people often consider both the action and the context. The boyfriend's actions were out of anger and hurt, but he did try to be considerate by waiting until her dad was there. The girlfriend's actions were dishonest, which could be a valid reason to break up. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the reason is considered sufficient. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, if the infidelity is the main issue, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's adding stress during her hospital stay, that's a point against him. But given that he found out about the betrayal, many might side with him. So, the answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
