We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital is the asshole. The situation is that he found out she was sending nudes to an ex she had blocked before, even when they were together on weekends. He broke up with her during her hospital stay after discovering this through her phone.\n\nFirst, cheating or betrayal is a major issue in relationships. If she was indeed being unfaithful, that's a valid reason for breaking up. However, the timing is problematic. She's in the hospital, which is a stressful time for her. Breaking up then could add emotional stress when she's already dealing with health concerns. \n\nBut the user also mentions that he waited until her dad was there before confronting her, which shows he considered her well-being. He didn't just leave her alone. Also, he felt the need to be honest and couldn't fake it anymore. The key points here are the betrayal and the timing. \n\nOn one hand, using hospitalization as a reason to avoid breaking up could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other, if the relationship is built on trust and she violated that trust, the breakup might be justified regardless of timing. The fact that she was sending nudes to someone she had blocked for being too flirty suggests intent to deceive. \n\nThe author's actions were driven by the discovery of infidelity, which is a legitimate reason. However, the emotional impact on her during a vulnerable time is a concern. But since the author didn't act out of malice and took steps to ensure she wasn't alone, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nIn the end, while the timing is harsh, the core issue is the infidelity. So, the answer might lean towards not the asshole (B), but there's a nuance where the situation's timing is unfortunate. However, the primary reason for the breakup was justified, so the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
