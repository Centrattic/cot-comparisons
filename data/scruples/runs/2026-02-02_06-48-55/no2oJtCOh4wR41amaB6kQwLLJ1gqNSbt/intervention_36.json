We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the guy found out through her phone that she was sending nudes to someone else, which is definitely a betrayal. But the timing is tough because she's in the hospital, which is already stressful. The question is whether breaking up under these circumstances is the right move.\n\nOn one hand, cheating or infidelity is a major issue in relationships. If she was indeed having an emotional and physical affair through texts, that's a valid reason for breaking up. The guy might feel lied to and hurt, and it's understandable that he can't fake being okay with it.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up during a time when she's already dealing with health issues could add unnecessary stress. Hospitals are not the ideal place for such a confrontation. The guy did try to be considerate by waiting until her dad was there and not yelling, but the act of breaking up during such a vulnerable time might be seen as cruel.\n\nBut then again, the author might be justified in ending the relationship because of the betrayal. The question is whether the timing makes the action wrong. Some might argue that honesty and integrity are more important than the timing, especially if the relationship is beyond repair. However, others might think that the hospital setting adds a layer of inconsiderateness.\n\nThe key points are: infidelity discovered, breaking up during hospital stay, and whether the timing was inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether the author's action of breaking up was inconsiderate given her situation, despite the reason being valid. \n\nIn many cases, people might say that the reason (cheating) is a valid cause, but the way it was handled (during hospitalization) is inconsiderate. But others might prioritize the truth and the need to end a broken trust, regardless of timing. It's a tough call between the validity of the reason versus the timing and method.\n"
