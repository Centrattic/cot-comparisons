We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend while she was in the hospital. He found out through her WhatsApp that she had been sending nudes to an ex over the past three months, even when they were together. He confronted her after her MRI, then left, crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The girlfriend is in the hospital, which is already a stressful time for her. The author discovered the infidelity or betrayal, which is a valid reason for a breakup. But doing it while she's in the hospital adds another layer. \n\nOn one hand, cheating or emotional infidelity is a major issue in relationships. If someone is engaging in such behavior, it's understandable that the other person would feel hurt and want to end the relationship. The author waited until after the MRI and in the presence of her dad, which might have been a considerate way to handle it, given the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, timing is a factor. She's in the hospital, dealing with possible health issues. Adding the stress of a breakup might be seen as cruel. However, the author might have felt that he couldn't fake being okay anymore. The question is whether the timing makes it wrong regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions were deceitful. She reconnected with someone she had blocked for being too flirty and sent nudes while in a committed relationship. That's a breach of trust. The author discovered this through her phone, which could be another issue\u2014privacy concerns. However, she gave him her passcode multiple times, so maybe that's a gray area. \n\nBut the main question is whether breaking up during her hospitalization is wrong. Some might argue that it's valid because the betrayal is a deal-breaker, and he can't pretend to be fine. Others might say it's insensitive to add that stress on top of her health issues. \n\nI think the key points are the validity of the reason for the breakup versus the timing. If the reason is legitimate (cheating), then the breakup isn't necessarily in the wrong, regardless of the timing. However, the method and timing could be handled more sensitively. But the author did try to be considerate by waiting until her dad was there. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a mix of justified reasons and potentially insensitive timing. But since the core issue is the girlfriend's betrayal, which is a major reason, the breakup might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
