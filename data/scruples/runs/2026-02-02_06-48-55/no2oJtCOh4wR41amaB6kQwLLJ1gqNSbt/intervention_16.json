We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves him finding out about her sending nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, which she had been blocking previously. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in the hospital, and the breakup happened during a stressful time. The author found out about her actions by checking her phone, which she had given him the passcode for. That's a point to consider\u2014using the phone access to look into private messages without her knowledge might be an invasion of privacy. But then again, if there was a mutual understanding of trust, maybe that's where the problem started.\n\nThe key issue here is cheating or betrayal. The girlfriend sent nudes to another guy while in a relationship, which is generally considered a breach of trust. The author discovered this through the WhatsApp messages. So from a traditional perspective, cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the timing is during a hospitalization, which adds emotional stress. \n\nNow, the author broke up with her while she was in the hospital. That could be seen as cruel because she's already going through a health crisis. On the other hand, the author might have felt that he couldn't keep up the facade anymore, especially if the betrayal was recent and significant. \n\nThe author also involved her dad, which might have been to support her, but it's unclear if that was necessary. The girlfriend's response was that she doesn't know why she did it, which could indicate a lack of remorse or understanding, which might justify the breakup.\n\nBut is breaking up during such a vulnerable time the right thing? Some might argue that it's inconsiderate and adds to her stress. Others might say that honesty is better, even if it's harsh. The author did try to handle it calmly, not yelling, and even apologized for involving her dad. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The betrayal is on the girlfriend's side, but the timing of the breakup could be seen as insensitive. However, the decision to end the relationship based on infidelity is often considered justified. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the cheating is the main issue, then the author isn't the asshole. But the way he handled it during her hospitalization might be criticized. However, the story mentions that the author waited until her dad was there to support her, which shows consideration. \n\nOverall, the main wrongdoer here is the girlfriend for the betrayal. The author's actions are a consequence of that. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not. The key is whether the breakup was justified despite the timing. Since infidelity is a major issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, even if the timing was tough.\n"
