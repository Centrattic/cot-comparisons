We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was admitted to the hospital with symptoms that could be serious (dizziness, weakness). The author was there with her, staying overnight. Then, while waiting for her MRI, he found out she was sending nudes to another guy via WhatsApp, which they don't use otherwise. The author confronted her after the scan, broke up, and left, crying. He also involved her dad, who had to come over. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing this.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is that he couldn't fake it anymore because of the infidelity. But the timing is while his girlfriend is in the hospital. That seems harsh. But on the other hand, cheating is a major issue. The girlfriend was being unfaithful, possibly with someone she had blocked before because he was too flirty. The author found out through her phone, which he had the passcode to. Wait, did she give him the passcode willingly? Yes, multiple times because he has a bad memory. So maybe he had permission to access her phone. But invading privacy like opening WhatsApp isn't necessarily okay, even if she gave the passcode. But in this case, he used the passcode she provided to check her phone. \n\nSo, he found out she was sending nudes to another guy, which is a betrayal. But doing this while she's in the hospital adds another layer. Breaking up during a medical crisis could add emotional stress, which might be considered insensitive. The author felt he couldn't fake it anymore. But maybe the right approach would have been to wait until she was stable before confronting her. Also, the girlfriend's actions were deceitful, but the author's reaction might have been premature. \n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to be upset about cheating. On the other, breaking up while she's in the hospital might not be the best timing. But the cheating is a fundamental breach of trust. So is the author the asshole? It's tricky. The cheating is a valid reason to break up, but doing it during her hospitalization might not be the best. However, the author's actions might be justified if he truly couldn't continue the relationship. The fact that he cried and asked her dad to come over suggests he tried to be considerate. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If cheating is a dealbreaker, then he's not wrong. However, the timing and method could be questioned. The key is whether breaking up during her hospitalization was cruel. The community might split here. Some might say it's valid to end it upon discovering betrayal, others might say it's inconsiderate given her situation. But given the circumstances, the author's actions are a response to a betrayal, so maybe he's not the asshole. But then again, breaking up during such a vulnerable time could be seen as adding to her stress. \n\nIn the AITA context, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide. Considering all factors, the cheating is the main issue, so the breakup is justified. The timing is unfortunate but not necessarily the author's fault. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. Hmm. I think it's a close call, but the cheating is a major factor. So the answer is B.\n"
