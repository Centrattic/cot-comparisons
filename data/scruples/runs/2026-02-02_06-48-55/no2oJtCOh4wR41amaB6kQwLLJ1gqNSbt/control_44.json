We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The person broke up with their girlfriend while she was in the hospital. They found out she was sending nudes to someone else, which obviously caused emotional distress and led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was already in a vulnerable state, being hospitalized. Breaking up during such a time could be seen as insensitive. The author might be considered wrong for adding emotional stress on top of her health issues. But then again, finding out about infidelity or betrayal is a valid reason for a breakup. The key factors here are the context and the timing.\n\nThe author waited until her dad was there to confront her, which shows they tried to be considerate. They didn't yell and cried while asking why, which could indicate genuine emotional pain. However, the timing of the breakup is questionable. Hospital settings are not ideal for such discussions, regardless of the reason. The stress of an unknown medical condition plus a breakup could be overwhelming.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014sending nudes to someone she previously blocked for being \"too flirty\"\u2014do seem like a breach of trust. But the author might have handled it differently. Maybe waiting until she was healthier to have that conversation would have been more compassionate. Still, the act of cheating or seeking validation from someone else while in a relationship is a valid reason to end things, even if the timing is bad.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The breakup itself might be justified, but the timing is inconsiderate. However, given the betrayal, some might argue that the author acted in their right. It's a tough call. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong because of the timing or if the reason for the breakup (infidelity) justifies it regardless of the situation.\n"
