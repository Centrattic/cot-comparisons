We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend while she's in the hospital. The situation involves her having an affair, which he found out by checking her phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl was in the hospital with serious symptoms, which later turned out to be clear, but the stress of that situation is there. The author discovered that she had been sending nudes to someone she had blocked before, even on weekends they were together. That seems like a betrayal. But he broke up with her while she was already in the hospital, which adds another layer.\n\nHe found her phone in the hospital, used her passcode, and checked the WhatsApp messages. Is that invasion of privacy? Maybe, but the content he found was cheating. So, the cheating is a valid reason for a breakup. However, timing is a big factor here. She's in the hospital, dealing with her health, and he confronts her after seeing the messages. Breaking up during a time when she's vulnerable could be seen as insensitive.\n\nHe mentioned that he kept his cool until she was back in her room and then confronted her without yelling, mostly crying. He also made sure her dad was there for support. But the act of breaking up during her hospital stay might add to her stress. However, the cheating is a significant betrayal, so the breakup itself isn't necessarily wrong. But the timing and method might be questionable.\n\nIs he in the wrong for the breakup? Or is the cheating a valid reason regardless of the timing? The user thinks he's at fault, but others might see it as a justified action. The dilemma is between respecting her privacy (by checking her phone) and reacting to the cheating. But if the cheating is real, the breakup is valid. However, the way he discovered it by checking her phone might be an issue in terms of trust and privacy. \n\nSo, the author has a valid reason (cheating) but handled the discovery in a way that might be seen as invasive. Then, breaking up during her hospitalization could be seen as adding stress. So, the author might be partially at fault for the method of discovery and the timing, but the cheating is a valid reason. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the breakup itself. Since the cheating is a deal-breaker for many, the breakup is justified. But the way he did it might be problematic. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up. If the cheating is the reason, then it's not the author's fault. However, the act of checking her phone without explicit permission could be an issue. But the girlfriend gave him her passcode multiple times, which might imply some level of trust. But opening WhatsApp specifically, which they don't use, could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, he's in a tough spot. The cheating is a valid reason, but the method of discovery and the timing of the breakup could be problematic. However, the breakup itself is a personal choice based on the betrayal. So, he's not in the wrong for the breakup because the cheating is a valid reason, even if the timing was harsh. But maybe he's in the wrong for checking her phone, which could have been a breach of trust. However, the initial question is about the breakup, not the method of discovery. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up is a personal choice in response to cheating, so he's not in the wrong (B). However, there are aspects of his actions (checking her phone) that could be criticized. But the main question is about the breakup, which is justified because of the cheating. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
