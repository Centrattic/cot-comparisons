There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a waiter who warned a man about his date, who comes in with different guys often. The waiter thought he was being helpful, trying to be a \"bro\" by looking out for the guy. But the girl complained, and the waiter got written up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the waiter is in the wrong. Hmm. Well, as a waiter, their job is to serve customers, not to intervene in their personal interactions. Even if the waiter thought he was helping, he crossed a boundary by sharing private information without permission. The girl's privacy might be important here. She might not want her personal life exposed, even if others might judge her choices. Also, the waiter's action led to the date leaving quickly, which could be seen as interfering in a customer's experience. The bar's policy might prohibit employees from getting involved in customers' personal matters. So, even if the intention was good, the action might not be appropriate in a professional setting. The waiter's job is to provide service, not to play matchmaker or give unsolicited advice. Therefore, the waiter might be in the wrong because he overstepped his role and violated privacy.\n"
