He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a waiter warned a guy's date about the woman being with different guys all the time. The waiter got written up by his boss because the woman complained.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of the waiter. As an employee, their main job is to serve customers, not to meddle in their personal relationships. Interfering like this might be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. Even if the waiter had good intentions, the action could be perceived as inappropriate or intrusive.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of privacy. The woman's behavior is her own, and the waiter sharing that information with her date might violate her privacy. The waiter isn't in a position to judge or act as a mediator in their relationship. The guy might have felt betrayed or uncomfortable, leading him to leave quickly. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the boss wrote the waiter up. That suggests the establishment has policies against such behavior. The waiter's job is to provide service, not to take sides or give unsolicited advice. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might have thought they were being helpful. But the question is whether this is their responsibility. In most cases, employees are expected to stay neutral and not get involved in customers' personal matters unless there's a safety issue. Since there's no indication of danger here, the waiter's intervention was likely unprofessional.\n\nSo putting it all together, the waiter probably acted inappropriately by sharing that information. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
