There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a waiter who noticed a regular customer coming in with different guys each time. When one of those guys came in, the waiter warned him about the woman's behavior. The guy left quickly, and the woman complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the waiter overstepped by intervening. The waiter's intention was to protect the guy, but maybe they crossed a line. Employers usually have policies against interfering in customers' private matters. The waiter might be seen as violating confidentiality or creating a hostile environment. Also, the woman's complaint suggests that the waiter's actions were perceived as intrusive or inappropriate. Even if the motive was good, the method might not be appropriate. The employer's write-up indicates that the action was against company policy. So, the waiter is likely in the wrong because they didn't adhere to their role as a server and instead took a personal action that affected customers' experience. The answer is A.\n"
