      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a waiter who warned a guy about his date because she comes in with different guys often. The waiter told the guy she's here all the time with different people, which led the guy to leave. The girl complained, and the author got written up by the boss. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm, first, the author's intention was to \"be a bro\" and warn the guy about potential infidelity. But as a waiter, the job is to serve customers, not to meddle in their personal lives. The waiter might have overstepped by sharing personal information about a customer without consent. The girl's privacy could be an issue here. Even if the waiter thought the guy was being duped, it's not the waiter's place to intervene. The boss wrote them up, which suggests that the restaurant has a policy against such behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the waiter was trying to help. But the problem is that the waiter doesn't have the right to share customer information, even if it's observational. The girl's behavior, while potentially questionable, is her own, and the waiter's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. The guy might have left because of the warning, but the waiter's job isn't to act as a matchmaker or detective. \n\nSo, the author likely violated company policy and invaded the girl's privacy. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
