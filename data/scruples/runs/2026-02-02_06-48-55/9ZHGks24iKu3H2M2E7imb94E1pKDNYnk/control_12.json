      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a waiter who warned a guy that his date was coming to the bar with different guys every week. The date left quickly after, and the girl complained, leading to the author getting written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. He says he was trying to be a \"bro,\" meaning he wanted to look out for the guy. But in doing so, he's stepping into a personal situation between two people. As a server, his job is to provide service, not to interfere in customers' personal lives. Even if his intention was good, he might have overstepped his role.\n\nThen there's the aspect of confidentiality and privacy. The server observed the girl's behavior over time and decided to share that information with her date. This could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if it was done out of concern. The girl might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she didn't consent to the server sharing that information.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the guy left quickly, which might have ruined his night or made him uncomfortable. The server's action caused a disturbance in the customer's experience, which is something the employer would likely take issue with. The boss wrote up the author because of the complaint, indicating that the employer believes the server violated company policy by interfering.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's intent was to prevent potential harm or deceit. If the girl was being dishonest with her dates, the server might feel he was helping a good cause. However, it's not the server's place to act as a mediator or informer in such situations. The server has no way of knowing the full story\u2014maybe the guy was aware of the girl's past relationships, or maybe there's more context they didn't consider.\n\nLegally, unless there's some form of harassment or illegal activity involved, it's more about the workplace policy and professional boundaries. The employer's response (the write-up) suggests they see the action as unprofessional. The server's job is to serve, not to mediate or police customers' relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the motive was good, the action was unprofessional and interfered with customers' privacy and their own affairs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
