There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the waiter who warned a date about his date's behavior is in the wrong. The scenario is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post.\n\nFirst, the waiter's job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. By warning the date directly, the waiter crossed a professional boundary. Even if the intention was good, the action was inappropriate. The waiter is an employee, and their role doesn't include giving personal advice to customers. \n\nThe girl complained, leading to a write-up from the boss. This suggests that the restaurant's policy likely prohibits such behavior. Employees are usually expected to stay neutral and not meddle in customers' private matters. The waiter's action could create liability for the establishment if the customer feels harassed or if there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAdditionally, the waiter's judgment might be biased. Just because the girl dates different guys often doesn't necessarily mean she's being deceptive. The waiter is making assumptions about her intentions, which might not be accurate. It's possible she's just sociable or in a casual dating scene without any malintent.\n\nThe key points here are professional boundaries, workplace policies, and the potential for misjudgment. The waiter's actions were unprofessional, even if the motive was to help. Therefore, the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
