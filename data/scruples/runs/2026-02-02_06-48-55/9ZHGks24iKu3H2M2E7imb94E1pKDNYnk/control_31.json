      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter warning a customer's date about the customer being with different guys every week. The waiter was written up by his boss, and the customer complained. The question is whether the waiter did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of the waiter. Waiters are there to serve customers, not to act as matchmakers or judges. The waiter's job is to provide service, not to mediate or interfere in personal relationships. By approaching the date and giving him that information, the waiter is stepping outside their professional boundaries. Even if the intention was to help, it's not the waiter's place to do so. \n\nAlso, the waiter might have violated confidentiality. The girl's dating habits are her personal business. The waiter has no reason to disclose that information to another customer. Even if he thought he was being a \"bro,\" he's still breaching trust and interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue the waiter was trying to help prevent someone from getting hurt. But that's a slippery slope. The waiter isn't in a position to judge or intervene in someone else's personal life. The boss wrote him up because it's unprofessional and could lead to liability. The customer's complaint is valid because the waiter overstepped his role. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. The waiter is in the wrong for interfering and violating professional boundaries.\n"
