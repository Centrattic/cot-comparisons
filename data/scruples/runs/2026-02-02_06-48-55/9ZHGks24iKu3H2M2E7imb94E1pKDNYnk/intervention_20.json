There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. So, the person in question is a waiter who overheard a customer's date and decided to warn the guy about his date's behavior. The girl comes in with different guys often, and the waiter felt it was his duty to step in. The guy left quickly after the warning, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter getting written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the waiter's actions. He's a server, so his job is to provide service, not to meddle in customers' personal lives. By approaching the date and sharing information that wasn't his to share, he's crossing a boundary. The girl's behavior is her own business, even if it's questionable. The waiter's intention might have been to help the guy avoid being in a bad situation, but he didn't have the right to interfere. \n\nThen there's the consequence: the guy left, and the girl was upset. The boss wrote him up, which suggests that the establishment has policies about not interfering with customers. The waiter overstepped his role. Even if he thought he was being a \"bro,\" his actions were unauthorized and could have legal or ethical implications. The girl might have felt her privacy was invaded, and the guy might have felt harassed or embarrassed. \n\nAlso, as an employee, his duty is to serve, not to act as a moral guardian. The business might have a policy against such behavior to avoid liability. Even if the waiter's motives were good, the method was inappropriate. He didn't have the authority to intervene in their personal relationship. So, the answer seems to be that the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
