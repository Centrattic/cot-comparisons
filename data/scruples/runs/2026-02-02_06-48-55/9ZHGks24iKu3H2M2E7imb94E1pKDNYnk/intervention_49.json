There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the waiter who warned a date about his companion is in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post, so we need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to be helpful, trying to protect the date from what he perceives as a manipulative situation. But as a waiter, his job is to serve customers, not to intervene in personal relationships. By approaching the date directly, he's crossing a professional boundary. The restaurant's policy likely prohibits employees from interfering in customers' personal matters, which is why the boss wrote him up. \n\nOn the other hand, the date might have appreciated the warning, but the method was inappropriate. The waiter didn't have a right to share that information without consent. The woman complained, indicating she felt her privacy was invaded. Even if she's acting in a certain way, the waiter's action was a breach of confidentiality and professional conduct. \n\nSo, the key points are: professional boundaries, employer's policies, and the impact on all parties involved. The waiter's action, while well-intentioned, was unprofessional and led to a complaint. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
