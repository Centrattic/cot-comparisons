There's a girl who comes in with different guys every week, and she's using the same moves each time. The waiter told one of her dates that she's there with different guys and he should be careful. The date left quickly after, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter getting written up. The question is whether the waiter is at fault.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is wrong. Let me break it down. The waiter's intention was to warn the date to protect him, but did they overstep? As a waiter, the main job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. Even if the girl is being deceptive, the waiter isn't the one to mediate that. By intervening, maybe they breached the customer's privacy. The woman might have felt harassed or that the waiter was interfering in her personal life. From a workplace perspective, the waiter might not be allowed to get involved in customer relationships like that. So, even if the intention was good, the action was inappropriate. The boss writing them up makes sense because it's not their place to do that. The waiter could have informed management about the situation instead of taking it upon themselves. So, yeah, I think the waiter is in the wrong here. They shouldn't have meddled in the customers' affairs.\n"
