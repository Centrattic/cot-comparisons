There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of theAITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a waiter, warned a man about his date, who he noticed comes in with different guys often. The date left quickly, and the woman complained, leading to a write-up from the boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional aspects here. As a waiter, the job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. The author's action might be seen as overstepping their role. Even if their intention was good, intervening in a customer's personal life could be considered unprofessional. The establishment likely has policies against employees interfering in customers' affairs, which the author violated. The boss writing them up suggests that the action was against company rules.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless the situation involved harassment or some legal violation, the waiter might not have legal liability. But ethically and professionally, they crossed a line. The woman's privacy and autonomy are also factors. The waiter assumed the man needed the warning without knowing the context\u2014maybe the woman is in a polyamorous relationship, or the man is aware and consents. The waiter made a judgment and acted on it, which could be seen as meddling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I agree. The correct answer is A. The author's actions were unprofessional and an invasion of privacy, even if the intent was to help.\n"
