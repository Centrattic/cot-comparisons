      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a waiter who warned a guy's date about the girl he was with, who comes in with different guys often. The waiter told the date that the girl is there with different guys each week, so he should be careful. The date left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter getting written up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the waiter is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to be a \"bro\" and help out the date. But from a legal or workplace standpoint, maybe not. As an employee, the waiter's job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. Even if the intention was good, intervening in a customer's personal matters could be seen as overstepping. The restaurant might have policies against employees interfering in customer interactions, which could explain the write-up.\n\nAlso, the girl might have felt that her privacy was invaded. Even if she was there with different guys, the waiter sharing that information with her date without her consent could be a breach of confidentiality. The restaurant might prioritize customer satisfaction and non-interference in personal matters. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might argue they were being helpful. But in a professional setting, employees are usually expected to avoid taking sides or making judgments. The date could have left for other reasons, but the waiter's action led to the girl's complaint. The employer's reaction (writing up the waiter) suggests that the action was against company policy. \n\nSo, considering professional boundaries and the consequences, the waiter likely breached company policy by intervening in a customer's relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
