The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person who wrote the post is a waiter who felt they were doing the right thing by warning a man about his date who might be cheating. The situation is whether the waiter is at fault for being written up by their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policies. As an employee, the waiter's job is probably to serve customers, not to intervene in their personal relationships. If the restaurant prohibits discussing customers' personal matters, the waiter might have broken a rule, leading to the write-up. That would mean the waiter is in the wrong (A).\n\nOn the other hand, if the waiter was trying to help the man avoid being cheated, maybe they had good intentions. But even if the intention was good, the method of intervening without the woman's consent could be problematic. It's possible that the waiter overstepped their role as an employee, which could lead to conflict and the woman's complaint.\n\nAlso, the woman's complaint might be about invasion of privacy. The waiter was sharing personal information about her without her consent, which could be a breach of privacy. In that case, the waiter's actions might be considered unprofessional, hence in the wrong (A).\n\nHowever, some might argue that the waiter was acting as a good Samaritan. But in a professional setting, employees are usually restricted from such personal interventions. So even with good intentions, the waiter might have violated workplace policies, leading to being in the wrong.\n"
