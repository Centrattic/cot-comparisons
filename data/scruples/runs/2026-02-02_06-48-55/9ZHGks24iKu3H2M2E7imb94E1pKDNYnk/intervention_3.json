There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a waiter warning a man that his date is there with different guys often, leading to the date leaving and the waiter getting written up.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The waiter's intention was to help the date avoid being in an uncomfortable situation or being taken advantage of. But the girl complained, so the boss wrote him up. \n\nThe key points here are the waiter's role as an employee and the boundary of his actions. As a waiter, his job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. Even if his intention was good, he crossed a professional boundary by intervening. \n\nThe girl might feel her privacy was invaded, and the date might have felt the waiter was overstepping. The restaurant's policy probably prohibits employees from getting involved in customers' personal matters. \n\nSo, even though the waiter had a good motive, he violated his workplace rules. The wrongness isn't about intent but the breach of professional conduct. The answer would be yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
