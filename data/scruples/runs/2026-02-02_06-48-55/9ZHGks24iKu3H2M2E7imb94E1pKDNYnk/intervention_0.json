      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. The scenario is that the waiter noticed a woman coming in with different guys weekly and used the same tactics each time. When she went to the bathroom, the waiter approached the guy and told him about her pattern, which led the guy to leave quickly. The woman then complained, and the waiter got written up.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to help the guy avoid a possibly bad situation. But as a server, their role is to serve customers, not to meddle in their personal lives. The waiter crossed a boundary by intervening in a private matter. Even if the intention was good, sharing such information without the woman's consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. Also, the bar's policy likely prohibits employees from interfering with customers' interactions, which is why the boss wrote them up. The woman's complaint suggests that the waiter's actions made her uncomfortable. So, even if the waiter thought they were being a \"bro,\" the action was unprofessional. Therefore, the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
