      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the waiter is in the wrong for warning the guy about his date. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the waiter is a server at a sports bar. There's a woman who comes in with different guys every week, using the same moves each time. When she goes to the bathroom, the waiter tells the guy that she's there often with different guys and he should be careful. The guy leaves quickly, and the woman complained, leading to a write-up from the boss.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the waiter at fault here? The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for trying to be a \"bro\" and giving that warning.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the waiter's role as an employee. Their job is to serve customers, not to interfere in personal relationships. By intervening, the waiter might have overstepped their professional boundaries. The restaurant's policy probably expects employees to stay neutral and not interfere in customers' personal matters. If the waiter's actions led to a customer complaining, the employer's response (a write-up) suggests that the action was unprofessional.\n\nThen there's the aspect of privacy and consent. The waiter didn't know the woman's situation. Maybe the guy was aware of her habits, or maybe they were in an open relationship. The waiter made an assumption and intervened without knowing the full story. That could be seen as intrusive or judgmental. Even if the waiter's intention was good, acting without knowing the context might have been inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the legal angle: could the waiter be liable for defamation if the woman sued? Probably not, but the restaurant might have internal policies against such actions. The employer's write-up indicates they consider the action a violation of their guidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might have thought they were helping prevent someone from being taken advantage of. If the woman was indeed being deceptive, the waiter's warning could be seen as a moral action. However, that's a gray area. The waiter's position of authority in the workplace doesn't necessarily give them the right to police customers' personal lives.\n\nIn many cases, professionals are expected to maintain neutrality. The waiter's job is to serve, not to act as a mediator or judge. Even if the intention was good, the action crossed into personal matters, which is generally expected to be off-limits for service employees.\n\nSo considering all these points, the waiter likely did something unprofessional. The employer's reaction supports that. Therefore, the answer would be that the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
