He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for warning a date about his companion. The scenario is that the waiter noticed a woman coming in with different guys each week and intervened by telling one of them she was there with many others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the waiter might not be liable because they were just doing their job and not directly involved in the relationship. However, ethically, it's trickier. The waiter was trying to help the date, but did they cross a line?\n\nThe waiter isn't supposed to interfere with customers' experiences. The bar's policy likely prohibits employees from getting involved in customers' personal interactions. By doing so, the waiter might have breached that policy, leading to the write-up from the boss. The woman complaining could be seen as her right to privacy and not wanting others commenting on her relationships.\n\nAlso, the waiter might have overstepped by assuming the date needed the information. It's possible that the date didn't want unsolicited advice, and the waiter's intervention caused discomfort. The intention was good, but the execution might not be appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nSo, the key points are: professional boundaries, the bar's policy, and the right to privacy. Even if the waiter's intent was to help, the action violated the employer's rules and possibly the customers' expectations. Therefore, the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
