He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. The situation is that the waiter noticed the woman comes in with different guys often and warned the latest one. The guy left quickly, and the woman complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the waiter's job is to serve, not to interfere. Even if the waiter had good intentions, intervening in customers' personal matters might be overstepping. The restaurant's policy probably expects employees to focus on their duties without getting involved in customers' relationships. The woman's complaint led to the waiter getting a write-up, which suggests the employer doesn't condone such actions. \n\nBut wait, maybe the waiter was trying to help. However, the method was inappropriate. The waiter isn't in a position to judge or intervene in personal relationships. It's possible the date didn't want that information, and the waiter shouldn't have shared it without being asked. Also, the waiter's actions could lead to liability issues if the situation escalated. The employer's response indicates that they agree the waiter acted unprofessionally. \n\nSo, the waiter's intentions might be good, but the action was unprofessional. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). The waiter's job isn't to meddle in customers' personal lives, even with good intentions.\n"
