There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week.

He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a waiter who warned a man that his date was there with different guys often. The date left quickly, and the woman complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to be a \"bro\" and warn the guy. But is that his responsibility? As a waiter, his job is to serve, not to mediate personal relationships. Interfering might be crossing a boundary. He doesn't have evidence that the woman is in a bad situation, just his observation of her coming in with different dates. \n\nThe woman complained, so the employer took action. The waiter might be overstepping his role. Even if he thought he was helping, he could be seen as spreading rumors or making assumptions. The guy might not have appreciated the unsolicited advice, and the woman felt her privacy was invaded. \n\nBut some might argue he was trying to prevent a bad situation. However, without knowing the context, it's hard to justify. The answer likely depends on company policy and whether the action was part of his job role. Since he was written up, the employer saw it as a problem. So the waiter is probably in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
