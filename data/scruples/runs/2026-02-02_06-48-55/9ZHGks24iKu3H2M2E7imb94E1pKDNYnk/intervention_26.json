      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. The scenario is that the author, a waiter, noticed a woman who frequently comes with different guys and uses the same tactics. When she went to the bathroom, he approached the guy and warned him about her, leading the guy to leave quickly. The woman then complained, and the author got a write-up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to be helpful, trying to protect the guy from potential deceit. But is that overstepping? As a waiter, their role is to serve, not meddle in customers' personal lives. By intervening, the author might have violated the bar's policies about not interfering with customers. The woman complained, so maybe she felt her privacy was invaded or that the waiter was being judgmental.\n\nAlso, the author made an assumption about the woman's behavior without knowing the full story. Maybe there's a legitimate reason she's with different people each week, or maybe the guy wasn't being taken advantage of. The waiter acted on his own judgment without evidence, which could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were just trying to help someone from being scammed. But even with good intentions, crossing into customers' personal matters isn't the waiter's responsibility. The employer likely has rules about not engaging with customers beyond their service duties. \n\nThe write-up from the boss supports that the author violated company policy. So even if the intention was good, the action was against job expectations. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. But legally and professionally, the author probably did overstep. The employer's reaction indicates that the action wasn't appropriate within the job's scope. So the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
