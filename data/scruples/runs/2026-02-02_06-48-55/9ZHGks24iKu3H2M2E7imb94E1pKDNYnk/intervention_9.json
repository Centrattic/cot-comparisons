There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a waiter who warned a customer about the woman he was with, who has different partners each week. The waiter got written up, and the woman complained. The question is whether the waiter is at fault.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to be helpful, but maybe he overstepped. His job is to serve customers, not to meddle in their personal relationships. By intervening, he might have violated the privacy of both the customers. Even if his intent was good, he crossed a line by disclosing personal information about a regular patron without her consent. \n\nAlso, the woman's behavior, while possibly questionable, is her personal choice. The waiter doesn't have the authority to judge or intervene in her dating life. The fact that she complained and got him written up suggests that his actions were inappropriate from a professional standpoint. \n\nIn a work environment, employees are expected to maintain a certain level of neutrality and not interfere in customers' private matters. The waiter's action could be seen as unprofessional and a breach of confidentiality, even if his motives were good. \n\nSo, even though the intention was to help, the method was wrong. The answer is A.\n"
