Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the author is a college student, 700 miles away from home, and the mother wants them to install a tracking app on their phone. The author argues that they pay for their phone, they live in a secure campus, and the mom is bipolar. They're asking if they're in the wrong for not complying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an adult college student, which implies they're 18 or older. Legally, once someone is an adult, their privacy rights are more protected. The parents might have concerns due to the daughter's bipolar disorder, but the daughter is not a minor anymore. The author is paying for their own phone, so it's their property. The mother's request seems to be about monitoring, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Also, the author mentions being in a secure campus area, so maybe the mother's concerns are overblown. However, the mother's mental health condition (bipolar) might affect her ability to understand boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, parents often have concerns about their children's safety, especially if they have a history of mental health issues. The mother's intention is to check if the child is using time effectively and to track their location for safety. But the child might feel that this is an overreach. The key here is balancing parental concern with the adult child's right to privacy. Since the author is living independently, the parents should respect their autonomy. The fact that the author is not living at home anymore also suggests that they should have more independence.\n\nHowever, there's a line between concern and control. The mother's insistence on tracking might be controlling, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that the author is paying for the phone reinforces their ownership and right to privacy. The mother's bipolar disorder could lead to erratic behavior, so the author might need to protect their own boundaries for their well-being. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not typical for adult children to be required to share their phone data with parents unless there's a specific agreement or need. The author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by not complying. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting this boundary. The answer should be B (No).\n"
