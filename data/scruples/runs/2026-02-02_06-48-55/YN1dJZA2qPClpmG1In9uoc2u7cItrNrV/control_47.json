Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed so she can see if the college student is using their time effectively. The student is 700 miles away, living in a secure campus, and the phone is paid for by them. They don't have a car and use the shuttle, so they're not going to dangerous areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy boundaries. The parents might be concerned because their child is away, but the student is an adult in college, which is typically when people start making their own decisions. The mother's request for tracking could be seen as overstepping, especially given the distance and the student's independence. Also, the mother has bipolar disorder, which might influence her behavior, but that doesn't justify the tracking without consent. The student is paying for their own phone, so there's an argument about ownership and autonomy. The mother's concern about time management might be valid, but using a tracking app is invasive. The student's refusal isn't disrespectful; it's about setting personal boundaries. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
