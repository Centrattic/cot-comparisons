Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a college student who lives 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The student isn't living with their parents anymore and has been on their own for two years. The mom has bipolar disorder, which might affect her behavior or concerns.\n\nThe student is paying for the phone and data themselves. They value their privacy and autonomy, which makes sense, especially living independently. The mom's request for tracking could be about safety, but the student feels it's an invasion of privacy. The student also mentions that the campus is secure with police intercepting people at the gates, so maybe the safety concern isn't as big as the mom thinks. \n\nThe mom's reason for tracking is to see if the student is using time effectively. That could imply she's worried about their academic performance or social habits. However, the student is an adult (assuming 18-22 years old), so the question is about boundaries. \n\nIs the mom overstepping? Since the student is paying for the phone, they have the right to control it. The mom's mental health might influence her actions, but the student isn't required to comply. The key points are autonomy, privacy, and the mom's mental health. The student isn't being disrespectful; they're setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their privacy and autonomy, which is important for an adult, even if their parent has concerns.\n"
