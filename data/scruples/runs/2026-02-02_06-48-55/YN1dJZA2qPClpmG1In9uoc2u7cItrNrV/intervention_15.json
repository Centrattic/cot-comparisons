Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author, a college student, to install a tracking app to monitor their phone usage and location. The author is living 700 miles away, has a paid-for phone, and the campus is secure with police presence. The mother has a history of bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult in college, which typically signifies a level of independence. Parents might still worry, especially if they have mental health issues. The mother's request for tracking could stem from concern, but it's also an invasion of privacy. The author is paying for the phone themselves, which adds another layer\u2014since they're responsible for it, they might feel entitled to control it.\n\nThe author mentions not living with the parents for two years, so the expectation of independence should be higher. However, the mother's mental health could affect her judgment. The question is whether the author is disrespectful for refusing. The key points are autonomy versus parental concern. In many cases, once a child becomes an adult and moves out, they're expected to have their own privacy. The mother's request might be overstepping, especially since the author is in a secure environment.\n\nBut does the author have a responsibility to accommodate their parent's request, especially given the parent's mental health? It's a balance between respecting their parent's worries and maintaining personal boundaries. The author isn't in danger from the location, and they're managing their own life. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They have the right to privacy, especially if the tracking isn't necessary for safety. The mother's actions could be seen as controlling, not normal. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
