Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants them to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage, arguing they're in a rough area and not using time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away, pays for their own phone, and doesn't have a car, relying on shuttles. They mention the campus is secure and there's police presence. The author's mom is known to be bipolar.\n\nSo, first, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether it's normal for a parent to want such monitoring, especially when the child is in college. College students are typically considered adults, even if under 21. They have the right to privacy, including their phone usage and location. The mother's request seems intrusive, especially given that the author isn't living under her roof anymore. \n\nThe fact that the author is paying for their own phone might also be a point. If they're financially independent, it's reasonable to expect some autonomy. The mother's justification about safety is a common concern, but the campus has security measures. The author's job and responsibilities as a student might require some privacy. Also, the mention of the mother being bipolar could imply that her requests might be influenced by her mental health, which might not be rational or healthy for the relationship.\n\nHowever, there might be cultural or family norms that influence this. If the parents have a history of close monitoring, the author might need to consider that context. But in most cases, college students are expected to make their own decisions. The key here is balance. Parents might worry, but respecting boundaries is important for the child's independence and trust. The author isn't in danger necessarily, so the tracking app might be overkill. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent's request is overstepping, especially given the distance and the child's independence. Privacy is a right, and the author has valid reasons to decline. The mom's mental health could also be a factor in her making such a request, which the author might need to address with care but not necessarily comply with it.\n"
