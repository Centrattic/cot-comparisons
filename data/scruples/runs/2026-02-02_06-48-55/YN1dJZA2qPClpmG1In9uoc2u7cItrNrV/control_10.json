Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The parent wants a tracking app to see if they're using time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away, living in a place with security, has their own phone they pay for, and doesn't live with the parents anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The mother might be worried about their safety, especially since their child is away at college. But the author is in a secure campus environment, which might reduce the need for constant tracking. The parent has a history of bipolar disorder, which could affect their judgment. The key here is consent and the authority of the parent. Since the author is an adult and has been living independently for two years, the parent's right to monitor their child's phone might be questionable.\n\nThe author has their own phone that they pay for, so they have a right to privacy. The parent's request to install a tracking app without the author's consent could be an invasion of privacy. The author is not in a dangerous area all the time and uses a shuttle service, which adds a layer of safety. The author's refusal to install the app isn't disrespectful; it's about maintaining personal boundaries. The parent's concern about time management is a bit odd since that's more about the author's personal habits, not safety. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to privacy, especially as an adult living independently. The parent's request is overstepping, especially given the author's independent status and the security of their living situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
