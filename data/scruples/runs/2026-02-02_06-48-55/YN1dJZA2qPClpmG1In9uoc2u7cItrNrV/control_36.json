      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, even though the person is in college and lives 700 miles away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an adult college student, so they're likely 18 or older. At that age, it's generally expected that they have their own privacy. The parents want to track their location because they're concerned about safety, but the area isn't too bad. The person has a paid phone and uses it for communication. They don't live with their parents anymore, which is important because boundaries often change when you're living independently.\n\nThe mother has a history of being bipolar, which might affect her reasoning or how she approaches this situation. The person is resisting because they value their privacy and autonomy. The key points here are the age, independence, privacy, and the parent's mental health. \n\nIs it normal for parents to want to track their adult child's location? In some cases, parents might be overly protective, but if the child is capable and living independently, this could be seen as intrusive. The fact that the parents aren't living with them for two years suggests that the child is managing on their own, so the tracking request might be crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the person mentions they don't have a car and use shuttles, but the campus is secure. Maybe the mother is worried about the trips to Walmart, but the person seems to handle their own affairs. The main issue is consent and control over personal devices. The person pays for the phone, so it's their property, and installing a tracking app without their consent would be an issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents' intentions might be good (safety concerns), but the method of tracking without the adult child's agreement could be problematic. Privacy is a fundamental right, especially for adults. The person isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their independence and privacy. The mother's mental health might contribute to her needing control, but that doesn't justify the tracking without consent.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their privacy and autonomy, which is reasonable given their age and independence.\n"
