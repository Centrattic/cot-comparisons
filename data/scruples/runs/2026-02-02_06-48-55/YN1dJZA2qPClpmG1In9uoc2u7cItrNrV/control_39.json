Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the author is a college student living 700 miles away from home, paying for their own phone. The mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, citing wanting to ensure they're using their time effectively. The author is reluctant, mentioning their independence, not being in a dangerous area necessarily, and their mother being bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult, a college student, which typically signifies a level of independence. They're paying for their own phone, which adds to the argument that they're managing their own affairs. The mother's request for tracking could be seen as overstepping, especially given the distance and the fact that the author hasn't lived with her for two years. The mention of the mother being bipolar might imply that her judgment isn't always reliable, though that's a sensitive point.\n\nIn terms of privacy, adults generally have the right to privacy, especially when they're living independently. The fact that the author is in a secure campus environment (with police intercepting people) might reduce the necessity for tracking. However, parents might argue concern for their child's safety. But the key here is the author's autonomy. They are paying for the phone themselves, so the mother's control over it could be seen as intrusive.\n\nThe mother's reasoning about time management and location tracking seems more about control than safety, especially since the area isn't described as dangerous. The author is setting boundaries, which is a normal part of growing up and establishing independence. The mention of the mother's mental health (bipolar) could be a red flag about her parenting style, but it's not a justification for the mother's actions. Instead, it might explain why she's making the request.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's not uncommon for parents to have concerns about their adult children, but the approach here might be overbearing. The author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by refusing. The tracking app would require both parties' consent, and since the author is an adult, they can choose not to comply. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong because they're asserting their independence and privacy, which is reasonable given their circumstances. The mother's request is crossing a boundary into controlling behavior, especially when the child is capable and responsible for their own life now.\n"
