Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The main points here are that the author is a college student living 700 miles away, pays for their own phone, and their mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage. The parents are concerned about effective time use, but the author feels their privacy is being invaded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and independence of the author. They're in college, which is typically a time when people start gaining more independence. The fact that they live far away and have their own phone they pay for suggests they have autonomy. The mother's request seems overreaching, especially since they haven't lived together for two years. The mother being bipolar might influence her behavior, but that doesn't justify the intrusion into the author's privacy.\n\nThe author's reasons for not complying are valid. They mention privacy concerns, autonomy, and the fact that their campus is secure. The tracking app would allow constant monitoring, which is more than just checking in occasionally. The user also points out that they don't have a car and rely on shuttles, which might imply they're responsible with their time, so the mother's concern about time management seems trivial compared to the privacy issue.\n\nLegally, unless there's a specific reason (like the child being a minor, but college students are adults), parents don't have a right to monitor their adult children's phones. Ethically, respecting privacy and personal boundaries is important. The mother's actions could be seen as a lack of trust and an overstepping, especially given the distance and the child's independence.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mental health mentioned, but that's about the mother's condition, not an excuse for the author's actions. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're setting boundaries. Disrespect would be if they dismissed the mother's concerns without explanation, but the author is just refusing to comply with what they see as an unreasonable request.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're maintaining their privacy and autonomy, which are important aspects of being an adult. The mother's request is intrusive and not justified based on the information given. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
