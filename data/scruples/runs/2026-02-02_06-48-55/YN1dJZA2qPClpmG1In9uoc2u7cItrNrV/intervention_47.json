Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The person is a college student living 700 miles away from their parents. The mother wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for, so the parents can monitor their location and phone usage to see if they're using their time effectively. The author is resisting this and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an adult in college, which typically signifies a level of independence. The fact that they're paying for their own phone suggests they have some autonomy. The mother is being asked to install a tracking app, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even though the mother's intention is to ensure the child is using their time well and the area isn't completely unsafe, the method might be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't live with their parents anymore and that the mother has a history of bipolar disorder. This could affect her approach to parenting and her understanding of boundaries. The tracking app might stem from concern, but it's also a form of control. The author has valid privacy concerns. They mention not being forced to talk to people they don't like, which relates to their phone usage and personal space.\n\nIs it normal for a parent to want to track their adult child's phone? It's a common debate. While some parents might do it for safety, especially if there are mental health issues, the child's right to privacy is a significant factor. The author isn't in any immediate danger, given the secure campus and the fact that they primarily use a shuttle. The mother's request might be overstepping, especially after two years of independence.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is concerned about her child's well-being. She might feel that without monitoring, there's a risk of the child making poor decisions or being unsafe. However, the key point is the age and independence of the child. College students are adults and expected to manage their own lives, including their safety and time management.\n\nThe author's refusal isn't about being disrespectful but about asserting their privacy. The mother's request could be seen as controlling, especially if she's not respecting the boundaries of an adult child. The fact that the phone is paid for by the author adds to the argument that they have the right to decide how it's used.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while parental concern is understandable, there's a line between concern and control. The author's situation seems to be on the side of maintaining personal autonomy. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
