Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. Their parents want them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The mother's reasoning is to check if they're using time effectively. The user isn't with their parents anymore, has been living independently for two years, and the mother has a history of being bipolar.\n\nFirst, the user's autonomy is a big factor here. They're an adult in college, which means they're expected to manage their own life. The parents might be overstepping by wanting to track their location and phone usage. Especially since the user is paying for the phone, it's their device, and their right to privacy should be respected. \n\nAlso, the mother's mental health could be a reason for her request. Bipolar disorder might affect her judgment, making her more anxious or overprotective. The user isn't to blame for their parent's mental health issues. The fact that they're in a secure campus with police checks adds another layer\u2014maybe the parents are worried about safety, but the user's environment is already secure. \n\nThe user isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their independence. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries, especially after living away for two years. The parent's request seems intrusive and not normal for an adult child's privacy. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
