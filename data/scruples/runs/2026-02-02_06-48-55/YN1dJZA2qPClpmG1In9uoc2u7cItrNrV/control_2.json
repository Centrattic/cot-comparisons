Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The main issue here is about privacy. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult now, in college, and has been living independently for two years. That's a pretty significant period of time. Their mom wants to track their location and phone usage to see if they're using time effectively. The user mentions they don't have a car and use a shuttle, so maybe the mom is worried about their safety. But the user is in a secure campus with police intercepting people, so maybe the safety concern isn't as pressing as the mom thinks. The user also points out that they pay for their phone, which adds another layer of ownership and privacy. \n\nThe mom's request might stem from concern, but the user is an adult. Parents usually have less right to monitor their adult children's phone activities. The user is setting boundaries, which is a normal part of becoming independent. The mom being bipolar might contribute to overstepping, but that's not the user's fault. The user isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their right to privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their own privacy, especially as an adult living away from home.\n"
