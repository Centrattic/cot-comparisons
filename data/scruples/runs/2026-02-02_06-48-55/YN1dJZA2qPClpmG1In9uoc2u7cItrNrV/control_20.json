Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app on the phone the author pays for, to see if they're using time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away from home.\n\nFirst, the author is paying for their own phone, which is important. They mention not living with their parents for two years and the mother having bipolar disorder. The mother wants to track location and phone usage. The author is concerned about privacy and autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the person (18 or older, since they're in college), the fact that they're living independently, and the cost of the phone. Parents generally have less right to monitor an adult child's phone. Also, the mother's mental health might be a factor, as she might be overstepping due to her condition. The author's privacy and independence are valid concerns. They're not in a dangerous area as much as the mother thinks, given the campus security. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their privacy. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
