Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on the phone they pay for. The mom's reasoning is to check if they're using time effectively. The user is concerned about privacy, mentioning they can talk to who they want, when they want. They don't have a car and rely on shuttles, and the campus is secure. The mom is bipolar and they haven't lived together for two years.\n\nFirst, the user's autonomy is a key point. They're an adult in college, so they should have the right to privacy. The phone is their responsibility and expense, so it's their device. The mother's request seems overstepping, especially with distance and the user's independence. The fact that the mom is bipolar might affect her judgment, but that doesn't justify the tracking without consent. The user isn't doing anything illegal or harmful by refusing. The situation is about personal boundaries, so the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
