      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a college student living 700 miles away. They have their own phone that they pay for. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using their time effectively. The user is concerned about privacy and autonomy. They mention that they don't have a car and rely on shuttles, and the campus is secure. The mom is described as having bipolar disorder, which might influence her behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the age and independence of the user, the financial responsibility, and the parental control aspect. Since the person is in college and living away from home, they have a legitimate expectation of privacy. The parents are not providing care or financial support, so their authority over the child's life is diminished. The tracking app request seems to intrude on the user's privacy, especially when they're paying for the phone themselves. The mom's mental health might be a factor in her overstepping, but that doesn't make the request any less about the user's right to privacy.\n\nThe user isn't being disrespectful; they're setting boundaries. Parents can be concerned, but it's the child's right to manage their own life, especially post-college. The situation isn't about safety in a dangerous area, as the campus is secure. The tracking app isn't necessary here. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
