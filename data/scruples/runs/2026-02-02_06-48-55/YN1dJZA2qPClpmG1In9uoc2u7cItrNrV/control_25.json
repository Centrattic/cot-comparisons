Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The author is a college student living 700 miles away, paying for their own phone, and their mom wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage because she wants to see if they're using their time effectively. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult in college, which means they're likely 18 or older. At that age, people are generally expected to have independence and privacy. The parent's request might stem from concern, especially since the author isn't living at home. However, the mother's request for constant tracking could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is paying for their own phone and managing their own life.\n\nThe author mentions that their mother is known to be bipolar, which might affect her parenting style. However, the mother's mental health doesn't automatically justify the request. The key points here are consent and privacy. The author is paying for the phone themselves, so the parent doesn't have a right to access it without the user's consent. \n\nAlso, the location monitoring is a significant invasion of privacy. Even if the intent is to ensure safety or effective time management, the author has a right to their own space and autonomy. The fact that the campus is locked and there's security might alleviate some safety concerns. \n\nIn terms of social norms, parents might worry about their children's well-being, but constant tracking without the child's agreement is not typical. The author isn't in a dangerous area constantly, just has rough spots like any town. The parent's insistence could be overprotective. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't disrespectful but rather a boundary setting. They're asserting their independence, which is a healthy part of adulthood. The mother's request could be a sign of control issues, especially if she's not letting go as the child grows up. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to privacy and independence, especially when they're paying for their own phone and living away from home. The parent's request is overreaching, and the author is justified in setting that boundary.\n"
