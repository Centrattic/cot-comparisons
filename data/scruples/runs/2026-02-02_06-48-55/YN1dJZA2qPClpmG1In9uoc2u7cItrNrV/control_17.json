Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app on the college student's phone to see if they're using their time effectively.\n\nFirst, the author is a college student living 700 miles away from home. They pay for their own phone, which is a smart phone from Straight Talk. The mother is asking them to install a tracking app. The author is worried about privacy and autonomy, especially since they don't live with their parents anymore and their mom has bipolar disorder. The key points here are the age of the person, their independence, and the nature of the request.\n\nCollege students are typically adults, so they have a right to privacy. Parents monitoring their child's phone when they're away at college might be overstepping, especially if the child is paying for the phone themselves. The mother's reasoning is about time management, but that's a bit vague. Also, the fact that the author isn't living at home anymore and is managing their own life adds to the argument that the request is intrusive.\n\nThe author mentions that the campus is secure, so safety isn't a major issue. The mother's concern about safety might not be valid here. Additionally, the author's mental health (mother's bipolar) could be a red flag for the mother's judgment in this situation. The author is asserting their independence, which is a normal part of growing up. The parents might not be respecting the adult child's privacy in this case.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to keep their phone private, especially when they're paying for it and are an independent adult. The request from the mother is an overreach. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
