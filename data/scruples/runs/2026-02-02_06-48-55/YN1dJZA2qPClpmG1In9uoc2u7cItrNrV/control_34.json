Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed on the phone the author pays for, to monitor their location and phone usage. The author is a college student living 700 miles away, not with their parents for two years, and the mother has bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and independence of the author. College students are typically adults, and they have the right to privacy. The fact that they live far away and pay for their own phone adds weight to their argument for autonomy. The mother's request seems overbearing, especially given the distance. The author mentions that the campus is secure, and they don't have a car, relying on shuttles. This suggests they aren't in immediate danger, so constant tracking might not be necessary.\n\nThe mother's mental health is also a factor. If she's bipolar, maybe her concern is exaggerated due to her condition. However, that doesn't automatically make her request valid. The author isn't obligated to comply if it infringes on their privacy. The key points here are the right to privacy, independence as an adult, and the parent's overstepping. The author isn't disrespectful for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
