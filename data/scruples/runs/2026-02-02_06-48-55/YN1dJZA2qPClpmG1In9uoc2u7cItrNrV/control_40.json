      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the college student to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves, so the mom can monitor their location and phone usage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is 700 miles away from home, in a place that's not necessarily dangerous but has rough areas. They live in a secured campus with police presence, so safety might not be the main issue here. They have a phone they bought themselves, which they pay for, and they use it for communication and data. The parent wants to track them, even though they haven't lived together for two years. Also, the mother is known to be bipolar, which might affect her perception of the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are privacy and boundaries. The person is an adult in college, which typically is when people are expected to have more independence. However, parents might still worry about their child's safety, especially if they're far away. The question is whether the parent's request is reasonable and if the person is being disrespectful by refusing.\n\nIn the US, there's a cultural emphasis on personal privacy. Even if the parent has good intentions, installing a tracking app without the person's consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The person is paying for the phone and its service, so they might have the right to decide how it's used. The mother's mental health (bipolar disorder) might also play a role here, as it could lead to overprotective or controlling behaviors.\n\nThe person is not living with their parents anymore, so the dynamics have changed. Parents might still want to stay involved, but the adult child is entitled to their own space. Refusing to install the app isn't necessarily disrespectful; it's about setting boundaries. The parent's concern about time management and location tracking could be valid, but the method of using a tracking app without the person's full consent is questionable.\n\nAlso, the person mentions they don't have a car and rely on shuttles, so maybe the parent is concerned about their safety. However, if the campus is secured and the areas they frequent aren't dangerous, maybe the concern is misplaced. It's possible the parent's request is more about control than safety.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, parents can't monitor their adult children's phones without consent. Since the person is an adult, their privacy rights are stronger. The fact that the phone is paid for by the individual further supports their right to privacy.\n\nBut some might argue that the parent's intentions are to protect and help their child, so the child should comply. However, the child is an adult and should be able to make their own decisions. The parent might need to adjust their expectations now that the child is independent.\n\nConsidering all this, the person is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and refusing to install the tracking app. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
