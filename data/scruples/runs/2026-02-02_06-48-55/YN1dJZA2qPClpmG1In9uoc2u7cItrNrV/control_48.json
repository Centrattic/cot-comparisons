Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles away from their parents. They bought their own phone and pay for it themselves. The mom wants them to install a tracking app so she can see if they're using their time effectively. The user is worried about privacy and autonomy, especially since they live in a secure campus area with police presence. They also mention the mom has bipolar disorder, which might affect her judgment.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult, so they have the right to their own phone and privacy. The parents are trying to monitor them even though they live separately. The user isn't doing anything illegal or harmful by not complying. The tracking app seems more about control than safety, given the secure campus. The user's argument about paying for the phone and not wanting to be tracked without their consent makes sense. The mom's request might stem from anxiety or mental health issues, but that doesn't justify overstepping. The user isn't disrespectful for protecting their own boundaries. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
