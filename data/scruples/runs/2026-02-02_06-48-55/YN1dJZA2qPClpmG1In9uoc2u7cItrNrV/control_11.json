Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The parent wants a tracking app so they can check if the kid is using their time effectively. The kid is a college student 700 miles away, pays for their own phone, and lives in a secure campus.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be worried about their child's safety, especially since the area isn't perfect and the kid uses public transport. But the kid is an adult, 20 years old, and has been living away for two years. The parent is also described as bipolar, which might affect their judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, the kid's point is about privacy and autonomy. They're paying for their own phone, so they should have control over it. The parent's request could be seen as overstepping, especially since the kid is in a secure environment with police checks. \n\nThe question is whether the parent's concern is valid. But even if it is, the kid has the right to privacy. The parent's mental health might contribute to excessive control. The kid isn't in danger if they're on campus with security. So, not allowing the app isn't disrespectful; it's about setting boundaries. \n\nNormal parenting would respect the adult child's privacy. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
