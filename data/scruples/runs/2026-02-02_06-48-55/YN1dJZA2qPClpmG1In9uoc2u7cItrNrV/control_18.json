Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed on the phone the student pays for. The student is in college, 700 miles away, and the phone is paid for by them.\n\nFirst, the student's autonomy is important. They are an adult, even if they're a college student. The fact that they live 700 miles away suggests they're independent. The mother's request might stem from concern, but it's also an invasion of privacy. The student is paying for the phone, so the parent doesn't have a right to control it. Plus, the mother has a bipolar disorder, which might affect her judgment. The student's reasons for not wanting to be tracked\u2014like wanting privacy and control over their own life\u2014are valid. \n\nIs it normal for a parent to want to track their child's location? It could be if the child were younger or living at home, but since the student is in college and independent, it's not appropriate. The student isn't being disrespectful; they're setting boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
