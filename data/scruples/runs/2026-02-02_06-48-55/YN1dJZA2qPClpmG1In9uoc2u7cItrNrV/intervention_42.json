Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed so she can monitor their location and phone usage. The author is a college student living 700 miles away, in a secure campus area, and they've been paying for their own phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. As an adult, the author has the right to privacy, especially since they're living independently. Parents typically don't have the right to monitor their adult children's phones without consent. The mother's request might stem from concern, but it's important to balance that with the adult child's autonomy.\n\nThe mother has a history of bipolar disorder, which might influence her need for control or reassurance. However, that doesn't necessarily justify violating the child's privacy. The author hasn't lived with their parents for two years, which is a significant period, so dependency should have decreased over time.\n\nThe campus is described as secure, with police intercepting people, so the safety concern might be overblown. The author uses a weekend shuttle for essentials, so their movements are somewhat predictable. The tracking app request seems excessive given the environment they're in.\n\nFinancial aspect: the author pays for their own phone, so the mother isn't contributing to the cost. This could be another angle\u2014using someone else's money to monitor them isn't fair.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries, which is a healthy thing. Respecting personal boundaries is crucial in relationships. If the parents are causing stress by pressuring the child, that's their issue, not the child's wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, some might argue that parental concern is valid, especially if there's a mental health history. But the key is whether the method (tracking app without consent) is appropriate. The mother's approach might not be healthy, but the author isn't in the wrong for resisting.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their privacy, especially as an adult living independently. The mother's request is intrusive, and the author is justified in not complying.\n"
