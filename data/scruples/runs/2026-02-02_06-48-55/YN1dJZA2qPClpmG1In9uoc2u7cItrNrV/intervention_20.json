Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The author is a college student who lives 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app to see if they're using their time effectively. The author pays for the phone and data themselves, and they don't have a car, relying on shuttles. The campus is secure, but the mom is bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult in college, which typically signifies a level of independence. The parent's request is based on concern, possibly due to their mental health condition. However, the author is paying for their own phone, so there's a question of autonomy. \n\nThe parent wants to track the author's location and phone usage. The author argues that they don't live at home anymore and value their privacy. The key points here are the parent's mental health, the author's independence, and privacy rights. \n\nIn many cases, once a child leaves home for college, the expectation is that they have more independence. Parents might be overstepping if they want to monitor their adult child's phone without consent, especially if the child is capable and responsible. The author's reasons for refusing\u2014privacy, autonomy, and not being under the parent's roof anymore\u2014are valid. \n\nHowever, the parent's request might stem from genuine worry, given their bipolar condition. But even with that, forcing an adult child to install tracking software without their agreement is a violation of privacy. The author isn't disrespecting their parents but standing up for their own boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to privacy and independence as a college student living away from home.\n"
