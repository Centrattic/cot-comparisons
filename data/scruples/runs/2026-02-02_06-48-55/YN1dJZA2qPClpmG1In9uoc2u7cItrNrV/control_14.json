Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother wanting to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The author is a college student living 700 miles away and has privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents want to track their child's location and phone usage to ensure they're using their time effectively. The child is in college, which is a time when many people start gaining more independence. The mother is described as having bipolar disorder, which might affect her judgment or anxiety levels, leading her to want more control or reassurance.\n\nThe author mentions they don't live with their parents anymore and have their own expenses for the phone. Privacy is a big factor here. Even though the parents might have good intentions\u2014like making sure their child is safe\u2014it's important to recognize the child's right to privacy, especially as an adult. The author is paying for the phone, so the parents aren't the ones footing the bill, which adds another layer to the argument that the child should have control over their own device.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between safety and privacy. If the author is in an area with some risks, the parents might be worried. But the author also mentions that they don't leave the secure campus much and use a shuttle. So maybe the actual risk isn't as high as the parents perceive. The key points are the child's autonomy, the payment for the phone, and the parents' mental health affecting their approach.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for parents to want to check on their children, especially when they're away. But as the child becomes an adult, the expectation of independence usually increases. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're setting boundaries. The mother's request might stem from anxiety, but respecting the child's privacy is important for their autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to privacy, especially since they are paying for the phone and are an adult in college. The answer should be B (No).\n"
