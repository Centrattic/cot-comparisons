Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author, a college student 700 miles away, to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage. The author is paying for the phone and data themselves and feels that their privacy is being invaded. They mention that they don't live with their parents anymore and that the mother has bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an adult college student, which implies they're at least 18 years old. At that age, in many places, they're considered adults and have the right to privacy. The parents, especially the mother, want to monitor their child's phone and location. However, the author is paying for the phone and data, which supports their argument for independence.\n\nThe mother's request is framed as wanting to ensure the author is using their time effectively and for safety. The author points out that they don't live in a dangerous area, have secure campus living, use a shuttle for shopping, and have police presence. So the safety concern might not be as pressing as the mother thinks. Also, the mother's bipolar disorder might contribute to overprotective or controlling behavior.\n\nThe author's reasoning for not complying is about privacy and autonomy. They want control over their phone and personal life. The question is whether this is disrespectful or if the parents are overstepping. \n\nLegally, once someone is an adult, parents don't have the right to monitor their child's phone without consent. Ethically, respecting an adult child's privacy is important, especially when they're living independently. The mother's behavior could be seen as overbearing, possibly stemming from her mental health issues, but that doesn't justify the intrusion into the author's privacy.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother's concern is for her child's well-being. But the author has already taken steps to stay safe (secure campus, shuttle use), so the tracking might be unnecessary. The author's refusal isn't about being disrespectful but about maintaining their autonomy. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers the balance between parental concern and the adult child's right to privacy. Given that the author is paying for the phone and data, and the mother's request is invasive without a compelling reason, the author is likely in the right. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
