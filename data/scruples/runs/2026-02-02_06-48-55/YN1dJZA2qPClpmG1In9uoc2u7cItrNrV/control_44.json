Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history and not installing a tracking app. The person is a college student 700 miles away from home. Their parents want them to use a tracking app so the mom can see if they're using time effectively. The location isn't bad, but there are rough spots. The user pays for their phone, bought it themselves, and doesn't have a car, relying on a shuttle. They're on a locked campus with security.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. As an adult, even if they're a student, they have the right to privacy. Parents usually don't have a right to monitor their adult children's phones without consent. The user is paying for the phone, so it's their device. The mom's request might stem from concern, but the user is in a different state, which is a significant distance. The fact that the campus is secure and there's a shuttle service might reduce the need for constant tracking. Also, the mention of the mother being bipolar could indicate that her request might be influenced by her mental health condition, adding another layer of concern about her motivations. \n\nIs the user disrespectful? If the parents are overstepping, then the user isn't wrong for pushing back. However, if the parents' intentions are genuinely about safety and the user is being dismissive of their concerns, there might be a gray area. But given the user's autonomy, paying for the phone, and the security of their location, it's more about respecting their privacy. The user isn't in the wrong here because they're asserting their independence and right to privacy, especially when they're an adult living away from home. The answer should be B (No).\n"
