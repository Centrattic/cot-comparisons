Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a college student who's 700 miles away from home and doesn't let their parents access their phone history. The mom wants a tracking app to see if they're using their time effectively. The author has a phone they pay for themselves, and they live in a place with security. The question is if they're in the wrong for not installing the app.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. As an adult college student, they have the right to privacy. Even if their parents have concerns, especially with mental health issues, the adult child isn't obligated to share their location or phone data. The fact that the author is paying for the phone themselves adds to the argument that they have autonomy over their device. \n\nAlso, the distance and the fact that they haven't lived with their parents for two years suggests they're living independently. The mother's request could be seen as overstepping, especially given her bipolar diagnosis. The author's reasons for not installing the app\u2014like wanting control over their data and who they communicate with\u2014seem valid. \n\nAre there any cultural or other factors? Maybe the parents come from a background where such monitoring is common, but the author is an adult. The key points are: adult child, paying for their own phone, living independently, valid privacy concerns. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their privacy and the choice to manage their own life. The parents, especially the mother with a mental health condition, might have overreaching tendencies, but that doesn't make the author wrong for protecting their personal space. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
