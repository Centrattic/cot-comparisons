Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a college student 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The mom's reasoning is to check if they're using their time effectively. The user is concerned about privacy and autonomy, especially since they're not living with their parents anymore for two years. Also, the mom is described as having bipolar disorder. The user is worried about being disrespectful by not complying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age and independence of the user. College students are adults, so they have a right to privacy. The fact that they're paying for their own phone adds to the argument that it's their personal device. Parents might have different views on privacy, but when a child is living independently, the expectation of privacy usually increases.\n\nThe mom's request is to monitor time usage and location. While parents might have good intentions, like ensuring safety, especially if the area isn't entirely safe, the method here is about tracking. The user already lives in a secure campus with police intercepts, so maybe the safety concern isn't as pressing. The user also mentions not having a car and relying on shuttles, which might limit their mobility but not necessarily put them in danger.\n\nThe mental health aspect of the mom being bipolar could influence her behavior. However, the user's responsibility isn't to cater to every parental request, especially if it infringes on their privacy. The user's refusal isn't about disrespect but asserting personal boundaries.\n\nCommon norms suggest that as people become independent, they expect privacy from parents. The user's stance is about maintaining control over their own life. The key factors here are the user's age, financial responsibility for the phone, independent living, and the parent's overreach. \n\nI think the author is justified in not complying. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
