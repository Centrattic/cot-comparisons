Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The scenario is that the mother wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The person is a college student living 700 miles away and has some context about their living situation being secure. They also mention their mom is bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is an adult, in college, and living independently. They've been paying for their own phone, which implies they have their own means and responsibility. The parents want to track their location and phone usage, which is a privacy issue. The mother's mental health history might influence her request, but that's not the main point here.\n\nIn most cases, when an adult child is living independently, their privacy is expected. Parents have a right to be concerned, but the method of tracking through a phone app without the child's consent can be seen as overstepping. The person is not in a dangerous area necessarily, and they have a secure campus environment. The fact that they don't live with their parents anymore for two years suggests they're in a phase where autonomy is expected.\n\nAlso, the person's mention of not wanting to be forced to talk to people they don't like shows they value their personal boundaries. The tracking app would infringe on that. The parents might think they're being responsible, but it's more about respecting the child's independence and privacy. There's no indication that the person is in danger or misusing their phone in a harmful way. So, the request seems controlling rather than protective.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to privacy and autonomy, especially as an adult in college. The parents' request oversteps, and the author isn't being disrespectful by setting that boundary.\n"
