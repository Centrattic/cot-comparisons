Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The scenario is a college student living 700 miles away from home, using a phone they pay for themselves. The mom wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using time effectively. The student is against it, citing privacy concerns, especially since they have a secure campus and use a shuttle. The mom is also mentioned to be bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the parent's request for tracking, the child's privacy, and the parent's mental health. The student is an adult (college student), so they have a right to privacy. Parents usually have concerns, but when the child is living independently, the balance shifts. The mom's mental health might affect her judgment, but that doesn't automatically make her right. The student is paying for the phone, which adds another layer of ownership and control. \n\nIs the parent's request normal? It's not uncommon for parents to worry about their child's safety, especially if they have a mental health condition. However, constant tracking might be an overreach, especially if the child is in a secure area. The student's arguments about autonomy and privacy seem valid. They are an adult, and their decision to maintain privacy isn't disrespectful. The parent's request could be seen as controlling, and the student is within their rights to refuse. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The student is protecting their privacy, and the parent's request is overstepping, especially considering the distance and the student's independence.\n"
