Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The person is a college student living 700 miles away from home, and their mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage. The author is paying for the phone and data, and they live in a secured campus area.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. The person is an adult, even if they're still in college. Parents might have concerns, especially if the child is away for the first time, but there's a line between concern and overstepping. The mother's request to track the phone usage and location could be seen as an invasion of privacy, especially since the child is not a minor. \n\nThe user mentions that the mother is bipolar, which might influence her behavior. However, the author's right to privacy shouldn't be compromised just because of the parent's mental health. The key points here are consent and autonomy. The author is paying for the phone and data, so they should have the final say in what apps are installed. \n\nIs the mother's request reasonable? Some parents monitor their kids for safety, but if the child is in a secure environment and the parent's monitoring is excessive, that could be a problem. The campus is described as highly secure, which reduces the immediate safety concern. The author is also managing their own schedule and responsibilities, so the tracking might be more about control than safety.\n\nLegally, the parent doesn't have a right to access the phone once the child is an adult. Ethically, it's about respecting the adult child's autonomy. The fact that the author is not living with the parent for two years also suggests they're expected to be independent. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Parents might believe they're acting in the child's best interest, especially if they have mental health issues. However, respecting the child's privacy is crucial for fostering independence. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their right to privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to control their own devices and personal data, especially as an adult living independently.\n"
