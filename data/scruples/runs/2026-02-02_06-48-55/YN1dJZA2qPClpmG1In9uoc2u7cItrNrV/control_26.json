Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation involves the mother wanting to install a tracking app on the author's phone, which they pay for, to monitor their location and phone usage, even though the author is a college student living 700 miles away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an adult college student, so they're likely 18 or older. At that age, they're expected to have more independence. The mother's request is to track the author's phone, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. The author lives in a secure campus environment with police checks, so the safety concern might not be as pressing as the mother thinks. Also, the author mentions that they don't live with their parents anymore, which adds to the argument that they should have their own privacy.\n\nThe mother's motivation is to \"see if I'm using time effectively,\" which seems more about control than safety. The author also mentions that the mother is bipolar, which might influence her behavior but doesn't justify the tracking. The fact that the author is paying for the phone and data themselves is another point\u2014using someone else's device to track without their consent is a privacy violation.\n\nLegally, once someone is an adult, their parents don't have the right to access their personal devices. Ethically, respecting personal boundaries is crucial. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially given the distance and the author's independence. The campus security mentioned also reduces the safety concern, so the tracking isn't about safety but possibly control.\n\nThe author isn't being disrespectful by not complying. They're asserting their right to privacy. The mother's request is intrusive, and the author has every right to refuse. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
