Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The author is a college student living 700 miles away from home, paying for their own phone, and the mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage. The parents' reasoning is to ensure they're using time effectively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult college student, which typically signifies independence. They're paying for their own phone, which reinforces that they have autonomy over their device. Parents wanting to track their child's location might come from a place of concern, especially if the child is in a new environment. However, the mother has a history of being bipolar, which might contribute to overprotectiveness or different parenting styles. \n\nNext, the author's perspective. They value their privacy and independence. They mention not wanting to be forced to talk to people they don't like, which relates to their right to control their communications. The campus is described as secure, so safety concerns might be mitigated. The mother's request seems to be about monitoring time usage rather than safety, which the author finds intrusive.\n\nLegally, once a person is an adult, parents don't have the legal right to monitor their phone without consent. Ethically, privacy is a significant aspect of adult life. However, cultural or family norms might vary. The author is in a different state, so physical proximity is low, which usually reduces the expectation of such monitoring.\n\nThe key points here are the age and independence of the author, the payment for the phone (indicating ownership), and the mother's mental health history affecting her parenting approach. The author's refusal is about maintaining personal boundaries. While the mother's intentions might be protective, the author has the right to privacy and autonomy. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say parents have a right to ensure their child's well-being, but when the child is an adult, the balance shifts towards the adult's autonomy. The mother's mental health could be a factor, but that doesn't override the adult child's rights. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their independence and privacy as an adult, which is a reasonable stance given their circumstances.\n"
