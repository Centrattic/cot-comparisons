Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the college student to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The student is 700 miles away, in a place with some rough areas, but they mention security measures like campus walls and police. The parent is described as bipolar, and they haven't lived together for two years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, a college student paying for their own phone. Privacy is a big aspect here. Parents usually want to protect their children, especially when they're away, but tracking an adult child's phone might cross a line. Even if it's for safety, the author has their own means of transportation (or lack thereof, since they use a shuttle) and mention the campus being secure.\n\nThe parent's request is framed as wanting to see if the author is using their time effectively, which might not be a safety issue but more about productivity. The author's refusal is about maintaining autonomy over their device and privacy. Given that the author is an adult, paying for their own phone, and not under the parent's direct care anymore, the right to privacy is more justified. Also, the parent's mental health (bipolar) might influence the request, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between privacy and parental concern. The author is in a new environment, and the parent might be worried. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting to comply, especially if they're paying for the phone themselves. It's about boundaries. Since the author is an adult, their right to privacy is stronger. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
