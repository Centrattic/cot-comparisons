Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. They've been paying for their own phone, so they probably want some independence. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using time effectively.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult, even if they're in college. That's a key point. Parents typically don't have the right to monitor an adult child's phone without consent. The user is paying for the phone, so it's their device, and they should have the right to privacy. \n\nThe mom is described as being bipolar. While mental health issues can affect how someone perceives situations, it doesn't automatically justify invasive behavior. The user hasn't lived with their parents for two years, so the dynamic is more about maintaining boundaries rather than parental oversight over a minor.\n\nThe user lives in a secure campus area with police checks, so safety might not be the main concern. The mom's request seems more about control than safety. The user is not being disrespectful; they're asserting their autonomy. Installing a tracking app would be a violation of their privacy. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their privacy and independence, especially as an adult in college. The answer should be B.\n"
