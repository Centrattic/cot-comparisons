Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation involves the mother wanting a tracking app on the author's phone, which they pay for themselves. The author is a college student 700 miles away, not living with the parents for two years, and the mother is described as bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an adult college student, which typically signifies a level of independence. They mention that they pay for their own phone, which suggests that they have financial autonomy. The parents want a tracking app to monitor the author's location and phone usage, citing concern about effective time use. However, the author is in a place with some security measures (like Trump's wall reference) and mentions that they don't leave the campus, only using a shuttle for essentials.\n\nThe mother's request could be seen as overbearing, especially considering the distance. The author's refusal might be about privacy and autonomy. However, parents often have concerns about their children's safety, even when they're adults. The mother's bipolar disorder might influence her behavior, making her more anxious or controlling.\n\nLegally, once someone is an adult, their parents don't have the right to access their phone without consent. Ethically, it's about respecting personal boundaries. The author is not violating any laws by refusing. On the other hand, parents often have good intentions, even if their methods are intrusive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is disrespectful. The author is standing up for their privacy, which is a valid right. The parents, especially the mother, might see it as a lack of respect or disobedience, but from the author's perspective, it's about maintaining autonomy. The fact that the author is paying for the phone themselves adds to the argument that they have a right to control it.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The situation involves balancing parental concern with the adult child's right to privacy and independence. The author's decision not to install the tracking app is a reasonable exercise of their autonomy.\n"
