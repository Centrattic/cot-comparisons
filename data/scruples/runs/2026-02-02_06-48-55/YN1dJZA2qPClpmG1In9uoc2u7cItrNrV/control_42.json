Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The person is a college student living 700 miles away, and their mom wants them to install a tracking app. The key points here are the privacy aspect and the parents' concern.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult in college, which means they're likely 18 or older. At that age, they have the right to privacy. The parents want to track their location and phone usage because they're worried about the student's time management. But the student is paying for their own phone, so there's an argument about personal property here. \n\nThe mom has a history of bipolar disorder, which might explain the need for control, but that doesn't necessarily justify invading the student's privacy. The student is in a secure campus environment with police presence, so the safety concerns might not be as big as the parents think. Also, the student is managing their own life, which includes their phone usage and location. \n\nThe main issue is consent. The parents are asking to install a tracking app without the student's consent, which is a violation of privacy. Even if the parents have good intentions, the right to privacy is important for an adult child. The student is not in the wrong for protecting their own privacy. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
