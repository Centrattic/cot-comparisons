Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The author is a college student living 700 miles away from home and has their own phone that they pay for. The mom wants a tracking app so she can check if the author is using their time effectively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The author is an adult, even if they're a student. They're not living with their parents anymore, which is a big point. The fact that they pay for their phone suggests they have autonomy over it. Parents usually don't have a right to access their adult children's phones unless there's a specific reason, like legal issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe mom's reasoning is about tracking time usage and location. Even though the area isn't the worst, the author mentions using a shuttle for errands and living in a secure campus. The mom's request might stem from concern, but it's overstepping. The author's argument is about personal privacy and freedom of communication. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the mother is bipolar, which might explain the need for control. However, mental health shouldn't justify invading someone's privacy. The author's boundaries here are reasonable. They're not in the wrong for setting limits on their personal space. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their privacy as an adult, and the parent's request is intrusive without a valid reason.\n"
