Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. Their parents want them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for, so the parents can check if they're using their time effectively. The user is refusing.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult, even if they're still in college. They mention paying for their phone, which suggests some level of independence. The parents' request seems to be about monitoring their location and phone usage. The user feels it's an invasion of privacy, especially since they're not living with their parents anymore. The user also mentions that their mother has bipolar disorder, which might influence her need for control.\n\nFrom a privacy perspective, adults generally have the right to their own privacy. The parents might have good intentions, thinking they're ensuring their child's safety or productivity, but the method is questionable. The user is in a secure campus environment with police checks, so maybe the safety concern isn't as pressing as the parents think. \n\nThe user's refusal isn't just about being disrespectful; it's about asserting their independence and personal boundaries. The parents' request could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's coming from a place of controlling behavior rather than genuine concern. The fact that the user is managing their own finances and phone indicates they're capable of making their own decisions.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between privacy and parental concern. If the parents are genuinely worried about the child's safety, they might feel justified. But in this case, the user is in a secure environment, and the tracking isn't about safety but about time management. That's a different issue. The user's reasoning seems valid\u2014they want control over their own life and how they use their time.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for their privacy and independence, which is appropriate for an adult. The parents need to adjust their approach, focusing on trust and respect rather than monitoring. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
