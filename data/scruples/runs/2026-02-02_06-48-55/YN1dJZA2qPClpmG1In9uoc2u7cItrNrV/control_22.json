Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app on the college student's phone to check if they're using time effectively. The student is 700 miles away, pays for the phone themselves, and lives in a secure campus.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The student is an adult, a college student, so they should have the right to privacy. Parents might be concerned, especially if the mom is bipolar, but that doesn't justify tracking. The student is paying for their own phone, so it's their property. The tracking app would be a violation of their right to privacy.\n\nAlso, the student mentions they don't have a car and rely on shuttles. The campus is secure, so maybe the mother's concern is about safety. But tracking someone's location without consent is a big issue. Even if the mother is worried, it's not the child's responsibility to comply with that. The student is setting boundaries, which is healthy, especially after living apart for two years.\n\nThe mother's mental health might play a role in her overstepping, but that's not the child's fault. The key points are autonomy, privacy, and consent. The student isn't disrespecting the mother by not installing the app; they're protecting their own rights. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
