Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The mom's reason is to see if they're using their time effectively. The user is concerned about privacy and autonomy.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult in college, so they're probably 18 or older. At that age, they're expected to make their own decisions. The parents might have concerns because they care, but that doesn't mean they can enforce tracking without the user's consent. The user mentions they pay for their own phone, so they have a right to control how it's used. \n\nThe mom's request seems overstepping. Even if the parent is worried about their child's well-being, especially if they have a history of bipolar disorder, the child isn't a minor anymore. Privacy is a key issue here. The user is setting boundaries, which is normal for an adult. The parent's insistence on tracking without the user's agreement is intrusive. \n\nThe location aspect is another point. The user lives in a secure campus, so the safety concern might not be as pressing as the parent thinks. Also, the user uses a weekend shuttle for shopping, which is a regular routine. The parent's need to track location might be more about control than actual safety. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and right to privacy. The parent's request is crossing a boundary, especially without the user's consent. So the answer should be B.\n"
