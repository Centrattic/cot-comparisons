I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a college student living 700 miles away from home. They mention that they're in a safe area except for some rough spots in major towns. They've bought their own phone with a Straight Talk plan, so they're paying for it themselves. Their mother wants them to install a tracking app so she can see if they're using their time effectively. The user resists, citing privacy and the fact that they don't live with her anymore. They also note that their mother is bipolar, which might affect her behavior.\n\nFirst, the parents want to track their child's location, which is common for safety reasons, especially if the child is away. But the user is paying for their own phone, so there's a question about ownership and control. The user feels that their privacy is being invaded. The parents, on the other hand, might be concerned about their child's safety and academic performance since they're in college.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's request for tracking, the user's autonomy and privacy, and the fact that the user is financially independent (paying for the phone themselves). Even if the mother's intentions are good, the user might feel that their privacy is being overstepped. The user's argument is that they are responsible for their own phone and their own time management, especially since they are in a secure campus environment with police presence. The user's refusal is about maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nThe mother's mental health (bipolar) could complicate things, as she might have heightened anxiety or control issues. However, the user's right to privacy is a significant factor here. The user isn't in a dangerous area, and the campus is secure, which might reduce the necessity for tracking. The user's argument is that they are adults managing their own lives, and the tracking app is an unnecessary intrusion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are overstepping by demanding access to the phone they don't own, then the author isn't in the wrong. The author is setting boundaries, which is a healthy part of becoming an adult. However, if the parents are genuinely concerned about safety and the author is dismissive of their worries, there could be a conflict. But given the context\u2014secure campus, user's own phone, and the user's autonomy\u2014it seems the author is justified in not complying. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
