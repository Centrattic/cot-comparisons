Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author, a college student, to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage. The author is paying for the phone and data, and they live far away from home. They mention that they don't have a car and use a shuttle, and the campus is secured. The mother is also noted to have bipolar disorder, which might influence her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. The author is an adult, a college student, so they have a right to their own privacy. Parents usually have some oversight when their children are minors, but once they're adults, that changes. The fact that the author is paying for the phone themselves is significant. Their mom is asking to install an app on a device they own and pay for, which could be seen as an overreach.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she wants to see if the author is using time effectively. But since the author is 700 miles away and in a secure campus, the need for tracking might not be justified. The author's concern about privacy is valid, especially if they feel that tracking is unnecessary and invasive.\n\nThe mother's mental health (bipolar) might play a role here. Sometimes, mental health issues can lead to controlling behaviors or anxiety-driven actions. However, the author's responsibility here is to set boundaries, especially if they're an adult. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they are asserting their privacy and autonomy. The key points are the author's age/status as an adult, ownership of the phone, and the lack of justified reason for tracking. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
