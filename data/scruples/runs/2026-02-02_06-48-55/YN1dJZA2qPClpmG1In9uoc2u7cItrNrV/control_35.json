Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The main issue is the mother wanting a tracking app on the phone the student pays for.\n\nFirst, the student is in college, 700 miles away from home. The mother wants to track their location and phone usage to see if they're using time effectively. The student argues that the area isn't dangerous, they have secure campus, take shuttles, and the phone is paid for themselves. They also mention the mother has bipolar disorder and they haven't lived with her for two years.\n\nI need to consider boundaries and privacy. College students are adults, typically 18 or older, and have the right to privacy. The parents' request might stem from concern, but the student has a valid point about autonomy. The mother's mental health could be a factor in her overreach, but the student isn't obligated to comply. The phone is paid for by the student, so they should have control over it. Tracking someone's location without consent is a privacy violation even within families. The student isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their independence. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
