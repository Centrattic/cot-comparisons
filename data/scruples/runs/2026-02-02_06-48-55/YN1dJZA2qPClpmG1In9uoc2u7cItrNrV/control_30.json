Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The person is a college student living 700 miles away, and the parents want a tracking app to see if they're using time effectively. The parent is described as having bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. The user is an adult, which is important. Even if they're a student, being 18 or older means they have more autonomy. The phone is paid for by them, so it's their property. Parents usually don't have the right to access a child's phone once they're adults, unless there's a legal reason, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe parent's concern is about time management and safety. But the user is in a place with security measures (locked campus, police intercepting), so the safety concern might be overblown. The user also mentions they don't have a car and use shuttles, so their movements are somewhat tracked through that. The parent's request seems more about control than genuine safety, especially with a history of bipolar disorder, which might affect their judgment.\n\nIs the user disrespectful? The parent is asking for something that infringes on the user's privacy. The user is setting boundaries, which is healthy. So the answer is likely B, the user is not in the wrong. They're protecting their privacy and autonomy as an adult.\n"
