Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed so she can see if the college student is using their time effectively. The student lives 700 miles away, pays for their own phone, and the campus is secure. The mother has a history of being bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an adult in college, which is typically a time when they start gaining independence. Parents might want to stay involved, but the child might see that as an invasion of privacy. The fact that the student pays for their own phone could be a point\u2014since they're the one paying, they might argue it's their device. The mother's request for tracking could be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is not living with them anymore. Also, the mother's mental health, being bipolar, might influence her actions, but that doesn't necessarily make the child wrong for setting boundaries. The student is also concerned about privacy and autonomy, which are valid concerns for an adult. The campus security is mentioned, so maybe the mother's concern about safety is lessened. The key points here are independence, privacy, and the parent's overreach. The answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong because they are setting boundaries as an adult, and the parent's request is intrusive without justification given their distance and the child's independence.\n"
