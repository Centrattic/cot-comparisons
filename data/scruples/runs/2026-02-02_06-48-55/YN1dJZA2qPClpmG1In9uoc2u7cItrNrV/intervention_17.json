Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who lives 700 miles away from home. Their parents want them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The mother's reason is to check if they're using their time effectively. The user is paying for the phone and data, and they don't have a car, relying on shuttles for essentials. They mention living on a locked campus with security, so maybe the safety concern isn't the main issue. The parent has a history of bipolar disorder, which might affect their judgment.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, consider the parent's intent. They might be worried about their child's well-being, especially if they have mental health issues. However, the child is an adult (college student), which implies they're 18 or older. At that age, privacy is expected. The parent's request to track location and phone usage could be seen as an overreach. The child is paying for the phone, which supports their autonomy. \n\nAlso, the parent's bipolar disorder might lead them to make controlling decisions. The child's reasons for not wanting the app\u2014privacy, autonomy, already living independently\u2014seem valid. The campus security suggests they're safe, reducing the necessity of tracking. \n\nIs it normal? Probably not. Parents of adult children usually respect their privacy. The user's refusal isn't disrespectful; it's about maintaining personal boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
