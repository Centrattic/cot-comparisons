      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing their parents to access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed on the phone the person pays for, to monitor their location and time use. The person is a college student 700 miles away from home, in a place with some rough areas. They mention they don't have a car and use weekend shuttles, and their campus is secure. The mother is described as having bipolar disorder, and the person hasn't lived with her for two years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a college student, which is a time when individuals typically start gaining independence. The phone is their own, and they pay for it, so there's an argument for their right to privacy. The mother's request for a tracking app could be seen as overbearing, especially given the distance. The mother's mental health (bipolar) might play a role in her wanting to monitor, but that doesn't necessarily justify the tracking. \n\nThe person's reasons for not wanting to install the app include the right to privacy, control over their phone, and the fact that they're in a secure environment. The campus security is high, and they don't leave it much, which might reduce the need for tracking. Also, the fact that they pay for the phone themselves suggests it's their personal property, and they have the right to decide how it's used.\n\nOn the other hand, parents often have concerns about their children's safety, especially when they're away. The mother might be worried about their safety in a new area, even if it's a college campus. However, the balance between safety and privacy is tricky. The person is an adult (assuming college age is 18+), so the expectation of independence is higher. The mother's request might be seen as an overstep, especially if the child is capable of managing their own time and safety.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. Considering the factors: autonomy, privacy rights, and the child's capability, it's more likely that the parent's request is overbearing. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer would be B (No).\n"
