Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The scenario is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. The mother wants them to install a tracking app to see if they're using time effectively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. The person is an adult, paying for their own phone, living away from home for two years. They have a security concern as the campus is locked down with police. The mother has bipolar disorder, which might influence her behavior. The student feels their privacy is being invaded, especially since they don't live with their parents anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether refusing is wrong. The mother's concern might stem from worry about safety or wanting to monitor usage, but the student has valid reasons for privacy. Since the student is an adult and financially independent, they have the right to privacy. The mother's request could be seen as overstepping, especially given the distance and the student's autonomy. Also, the student's reasons for not wanting the app include personal freedom and privacy, which are important aspects of adulthood.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their privacy and autonomy, which are reasonable in this context. The mother's mental health might contribute to her pushiness, but the student isn't obligated to comply. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
