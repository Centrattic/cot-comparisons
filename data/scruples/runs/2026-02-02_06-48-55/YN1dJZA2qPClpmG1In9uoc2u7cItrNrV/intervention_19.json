Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their parents access to their phone history. The situation involves the mother wanting a tracking app installed on the phone the author pays for, to monitor their location and phone usage. The author is a college student living 700 miles away, in a place they consider safe, but with some rough areas. They have a tracking system on campus and take shuttles for essentials.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is an adult, a college student living independently, which suggests they should have autonomy over their personal devices. The mother's request could be seen as an overreach, especially since the parent's mental health (bipolar disorder) might influence her behavior. The author is paying for the phone, so it's their device to control. The mother's concern about effective time use and safety might be genuine, but the method of tracking could infringe on the author's privacy.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a different perspective. The main issue here is the balance between parental concern and personal privacy. In many cases, when a child is an adult, especially living independently, their right to privacy becomes more significant. The fact that the author hasn't lived with the parents for two years adds to the argument that they should have their own space and privacy.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the mother is worried about safety, given the author's location. However, the author mentions that the campus has strong security and uses shuttles, which might mitigate those concerns. The mother's mental health could also play a role, making her overprotective. The author isn't violating any laws or rules by refusing, so they're not in the wrong for protecting their privacy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not allowing the tracking app. They have a right to privacy, especially on a device they own and pay for. The mother's request is intrusive and not typical for an adult child. The author is maintaining personal boundaries, which is appropriate.\n"
