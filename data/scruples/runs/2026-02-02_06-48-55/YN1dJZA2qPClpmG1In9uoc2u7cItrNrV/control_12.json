Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the college student is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The parents want a tracking app to see if they're using time effectively. The student is 700 miles away from home, living in a secure campus with police presence, and doesn't have a car. They use a weekend shuttle to Walmart and pay for their own phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are concerned about the student's time management. But the student is an adult in college, which is a time when they're supposed to gain independence. The key points here are the age, the distance from home, and the fact that the student is covering the phone expenses. \n\nThe parent's request might stem from a place of worry, especially since the area isn't entirely safe. However, the student is on a secure campus with police intercepting people, so maybe the safety concern is overblown. Also, the mother is bipolar, which could mean she might have heightened anxiety or need for control. \n\nBut the student's right to privacy is important. They've been living away from home for two years, which suggests they should have their own autonomy. The tracking app would infringe on that privacy. Not wanting to install it isn't disrespectful; it's about personal boundaries. \n\nThe student is managing their own finances and time, so they have the right to make their own decisions. The parents might not realize that their child is now an adult and needs to set these boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason for maintaining their privacy, especially given their independence and the secure living situation.\n"
