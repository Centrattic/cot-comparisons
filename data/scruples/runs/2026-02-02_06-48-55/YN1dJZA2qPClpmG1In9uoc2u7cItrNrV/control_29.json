Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a college student living 700 miles away from their parents. They bought their own phone and pay for it themselves. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFirst, the user is of age, since they're in college, so they have the right to privacy. The parents are not in the same house anymore, which is two years. The mother has a history of bipolar disorder, which might make her more controlling or concerned, but that doesn't justify overstepping. The user is an adult, responsible for their own decisions. The tracking app request is invasive, especially since they pay for their own phone. The user's reasoning about privacy and autonomy seems valid. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
