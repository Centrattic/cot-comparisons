Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to check if they're using their time effectively. The author is a college student living 700 miles away, pays for their own phone, doesn't have a car, and their campus is secure. They mention their mother is bipolar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult college student, so they're likely 18 or older. At that age, personal privacy and autonomy are generally expected. The parents might be overstepping, especially since the child isn't living at home anymore. The mother's request for tracking could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The fact that the mother has a mental health condition (bipolar) might contribute to her needing more control or reassurance, but that doesn't necessarily justify the tracking without consent.\n\nThe author is paying for their own phone, which adds to the argument that their privacy should be respected. The campus is secure, so the safety concern might be mitigated. The author also mentions not wanting to be forced to communicate with people they don't like, which relates to their right to manage their own social interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, parents might worry about their child's safety, especially if they have a history of mental health issues. However, the appropriate approach would be to have an open conversation about concerns rather than imposing tracking without consent. The mother's request seems more about control than safety, given the secure campus and the author's routine (using the shuttle, staying on campus).\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some parents might want to check in on their kids, installing tracking apps without consent is generally considered overreach. The author is within their rights to set boundaries here. The fact that the mother is bipolar might mean she has anxiety or needs reassurance, but that doesn't make the request justified. The author isn't disrespectful for setting these boundaries; they're asserting their independence and privacy.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting their privacy and autonomy as an adult, which is reasonable. The mother's request is intrusive, especially without a legitimate safety reason given the context."
