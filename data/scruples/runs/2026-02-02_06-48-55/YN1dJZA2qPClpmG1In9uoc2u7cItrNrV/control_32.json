      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. Let me break this down.\n\nThe person is a college student living 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. They mention they don't have a car and use a shuttle, and their campus is secure. The mom is described as bipolar, and they haven't lived with her in two years.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor here. The user is an adult, even if they're a student, and they've been living independently for two years. Parents usually don't have the right to monitor an adult child's phone without consent. The fact that the phone is paid for by the user adds to the argument that it's their device and their privacy.\n\nThe mom's reason is about tracking time usage and location. While parents might worry, especially if the child is far away, the method here is invasive. The user is in a secure campus, so maybe the mom's concern is overblown. Also, the mental health aspect of the mom being bipolar could mean her requests are more controlling or stem from her condition, which might not be healthy for the child to comply with.\n\nThe user is also setting boundaries, which is important. They're saying no to something that infringes on their privacy. There's no mention of the user being in danger or the mom having valid reasons beyond her own anxiety. In most cases, adults have the right to privacy, and parents can't enforce such monitoring without consent.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their privacy and setting healthy boundaries, especially given their independent living situation and their mom's mental health issues.\n"
