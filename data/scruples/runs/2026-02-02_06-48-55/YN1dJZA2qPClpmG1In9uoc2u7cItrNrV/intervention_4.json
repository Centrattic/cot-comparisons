Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. They wrote a detailed account about not letting their parents access their phone history. The key points here are that they're a college student 700 miles away, they pay for their own phone, and their mom wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage. The user is asking if that's normal and if they're being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy boundaries. The person is an adult in college, so they're likely 18 or older. Even if they're a student, being away at college typically signifies a level of independence. Parents setting up tracking apps might be overstepping, especially if the child isn't living at home anymore. The parent's concern about safety is understandable, but constant tracking could be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nAlso, the parent is described as bipolar, which might affect her judgment or anxiety levels. However, the child's autonomy should still be respected. The fact that the person pays for their own phone adds another layer. If the phone is their responsibility and expense, the parent shouldn't automatically have access without consent.\n\nThe location is a secure campus, so maybe the safety concerns are lessened. The user mentions that the campus is well-protected, which might mean the parent's fear isn't fully justified. The author is not forcing the parent to do anything; they're declining the request. The question is whether refusing is disrespectful. \n\nIn many cases, once a child is an adult and independent, parents shouldn't expect to monitor their every move. The author is asserting their right to privacy, which is a valid boundary. The parent's request could be a trust issue or control, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, the answer here would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy, and the parent's request is overreaching. The author is maintaining their independence, which is appropriate for their age and situation.\n"
