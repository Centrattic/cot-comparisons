Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college student not allowing their parents access to their phone history and refusing to install a tracking app. The parent wants to know if their time is being used effectively and to track their location, even though the student lives 700 miles away and in a secure campus. The parent has a history of being bipolar, and the student is concerned about privacy and autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The student is an adult in college, which is a time when people typically seek more independence. The parent's request for a tracking app might stem from a place of concern, especially if the parent has mental health issues. However, the student is paying for their own phone and is managing their own affairs. The campus is described as secure, so the practical need for tracking might be less. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking a second opinion. The core issue here is the balance between parental concern and the child's right to privacy. In many cases, once a child moves out and is in college, they're expected to have their own privacy. The parent's behavior could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's intrusive without a clear necessity. \n\nAlso, the student mentions not wanting to be forced to talk to people they don't like, which adds another layer of privacy concern. The parent's request could interfere with the student's autonomy in managing their social life and personal time. \n\nHowever, the parent's mental health (bipolar disorder) might affect their parenting style, leading to overprotective behaviors. It's possible they're acting out of anxiety rather than malice. But the student has a right to set boundaries, especially if they're not in a dangerous area and have their own ways of managing safety (like the campus security mentioned).\n\nConsidering these factors, the student isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Parents, even well-meaning ones, shouldn't have unrestricted access to their adult child's phone. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
