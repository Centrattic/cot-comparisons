Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants a tracking app installed so she can monitor the college student's location and phone usage, even though they haven't lived together for two years and the mother has a history of bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 18 or older, in college, and over 700 miles away. They've been paying for their own phone, which is a significant factor. The mother's request involves tracking app for \"effective time use\" and safety, but the area isn't super dangerous. The college campus is secure with police presence. The author is concerned about privacy and autonomy.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, adults have the right to control their personal devices. Parents might have concerns, especially if they have a history of mental health issues, but the child is an adult now. The fact that the author is managing their own expenses adds to their independence. The mother's request might stem from overprotectiveness, possibly exacerbated by her bipolar disorder, which could affect her judgment.\n\nThe author's reasons for not installing the app are valid: privacy, autonomy, and already living independently. It's not normal for parents to monitor adult children's phones without consent, especially when the child is managing their own life. The mother's behavior might be seen as overstepping, given the distance and the child's established independence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author has every right to keep their phone private, especially as an adult in college. The mother's request is intrusive and unnecessary given the circumstances.\n"
