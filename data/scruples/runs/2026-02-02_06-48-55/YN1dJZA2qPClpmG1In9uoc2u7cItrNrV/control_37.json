Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The parent wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using their time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away, living in a place with security measures, and they've been paying for their phone themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent wants control over their adult child's phone, which is a privacy issue. The author is an adult, even if they're in college. The fact that they've been living apart for two years and the parent is bipolar might be relevant. The parent's concern about safety versus the adult child's right to privacy is a key point here.\n\nThe parent's request seems overbearing. Even if the area isn't dangerous, tracking someone's location constantly without consent is an invasion of privacy. The author is paying for their phone, so they should have autonomy over it. The parent's mental health might affect their judgment, making the request even more problematic. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their independence and privacy. The response should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
