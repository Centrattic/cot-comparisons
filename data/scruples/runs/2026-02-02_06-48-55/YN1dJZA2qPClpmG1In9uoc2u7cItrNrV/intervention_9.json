Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author, a college student 700 miles away, to install a tracking app on their phone to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using time effectively. The author mentions that they pay for their own phone, don't live at home anymore, and the mother has bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult college student living independently. Typically, when someone is in college, especially away from home, they're expected to have more autonomy. The parents wanting to track their location might stem from concern, but there's a line about privacy. The fact that the author pays for their own phone adds another layer\u2014since it's their personal device and expense, the parent's request could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe mother's motivation is to check if the author is using time effectively. That's a bit vague. It could be about academic productivity, but tracking someone's location and phone usage might be too invasive. Also, the parent's mental health (bipolar disorder) might affect their judgment or ability to understand boundaries.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about privacy and autonomy. They mention not wanting to be forced to talk to people they don't like, which relates to their right to control their own communication. The campus is secure, and they have the shuttle, so maybe the parent's concern isn't entirely unfounded, but the method of tracking is the issue.\n\nI should also think about the legal perspective. In many places, parents can't legally monitor their adult children's phones. Since the author is an adult, the parent's request could be considered a violation of privacy. Additionally, the author's payment for the phone implies ownership, so the parent's request is more about control than oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is just concerned and wants to ensure their child's safety. However, the balance between safety and privacy is tricky. If the author is in a secure environment and the parent's request is excessive, the author isn't necessarily wrong to refuse.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is not in the wrong for protecting their privacy and autonomy, especially as an adult. The parent's request crosses a boundary, and the author's refusal is reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
