Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone. The context is that the author is a college student 700 miles away, living in a secure campus. The mother wants a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using time effectively. The author pays for the phone themselves and feels their privacy is being invaded. The parent is described as having bipolar disorder, which might affect their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult in college, which usually signifies a level of independence. The parents wanting to track their location could be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is living independently. However, the mother's intention is to check on their time management. But the author is in a secure environment, so the safety concern might not be as pressing. The fact that the author pays for the phone themselves adds another layer; it's their device, so they have a right to privacy and control over it.\n\nThe mother's mental health is a factor too. If she's bipolar, she might be experiencing episodes that lead her to overreact or impose controls. The author might be dealing with a parent who's struggling, but that doesn't necessarily justify the mother's demands. The author's right to privacy is important, especially once they're living away from home. The key question is whether the author is being disrespectful by not complying. The author's explanation focuses on personal freedom and the fact that they don't live with the parents anymore, which supports their position. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that parental concern, even if overbearing, comes from a place of care. But given the distance and the author's independence, the balance of rights tilts towards the author. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), as the author is asserting their privacy and autonomy, which is reasonable in this context.\n"
