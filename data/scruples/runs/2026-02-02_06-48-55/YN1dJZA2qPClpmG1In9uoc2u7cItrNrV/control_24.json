Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The scenario is about a college student living 700 miles away from home. The mother wants a tracking app on the phone they pay for, claiming it's to see if they're using their time effectively. The student is paying for the phone themselves and values their privacy. They mention living in a secure campus with good security, so maybe the mother's concern isn't based on safety but rather control. The student also notes that the mother has a history of bipolar disorder, which might affect her judgment.\n\nFirst, the user is in college, which is a time when people are expected to have more independence. The fact that the student is paying for their own phone suggests they're trying to establish autonomy. The mother's request for a tracking app sounds like overreach, especially since the student isn't living at home anymore. The mother's mental health issues might contribute to her wanting to monitor the student, but that doesn't justify the student complying if it's not necessary.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and autonomy. Parents have a right to concern, but once a child is an adult or in college, the expectation of privacy increases. The student's reasoning about not wanting to be tracked without a valid safety reason makes sense. The campus security measures indicate that the environment isn't unsafe, so the tracking app isn't about safety. The mother's justification about time management is questionable; it could be a way to micromanage. \n\nAlso, the student is paying for the phone, so the mother's insistence might be infringing on the student's personal space and financial independence. The answer should consider the balance between parental concern and the child's right to privacy. Since there's no clear safety issue and the student is managing their own life, the mother's request isn't justified. Therefore, the student isn't in the wrong for refusing.\n"
