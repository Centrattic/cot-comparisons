Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a college student who's 700 miles away from home. Their mom wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for themselves. The mom's reasoning is to check if they're using their time effectively. The student is living in a secure campus with police presence, doesn't have a car, and uses a shuttle. They feel their privacy is being invaded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Parents often want to ensure their child's safety, especially if there's a history of mental health issues, like bipolar disorder mentioned. But the student is an adult in college, so they might be expected to have more independence. The key points are consent and boundaries. The student is paying for the phone, so the parent isn't contributing financially, which might reduce the argument that the parent has a right to monitor. Also, the student is in a secure area, which might make the tracking unnecessary. However, the parent's concern could stem from genuine worry, but it's important whether it's overstepping. \n\nIs installing a tracking app without the student's full consent a violation of privacy? Yes. Even if the parent has good intentions, the student has the right to their privacy. The student isn't in a dangerous location given the campus security. The parent's request might be coming from a place of anxiety or past experiences, but the student's autonomy is important. The fact that the student is an adult and living independently for two years suggests they can make their own decisions. \n\nThe student's refusal isn't disrespectful; it's about setting healthy boundaries. The parent should respect the student's privacy, especially when the student is financially independent in this aspect. The student's concerns about forced communication and privacy are valid. So, the parent's actions are overstepping, and the student is justified in not complying.\n"
