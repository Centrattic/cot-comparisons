Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the author is a college student 700 miles away from home. Their mother wants them to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to see if they're using time effectively. The author refuses, citing privacy concerns and that they've been living independently for two years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might be worried about their child's safety, especially if the area isn't entirely safe. The mother has a history of bipolar disorder, which might affect her perception of the situation. She might see the tracking app as a way to ensure their child's well-being, especially since they're not living at home anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult, paying for their own phone, and has been independent for two years. They emphasize their need for privacy, autonomy, and control over their personal data. The campus is described as secure, which might mitigate some safety concerns. The author's refusal could be seen as asserting their right to privacy, which is a valid concern for adults.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the balance between parental concern and the adult child's right to privacy. Generally, once a person is an adult, especially living independently, they have the right to make their own decisions about privacy. The mother's request could be overstepping, especially if there's no immediate threat or valid reason beyond general concern. However, the mother's mental health might cloud her judgment, making her see tracking as necessary even if it's not objectively required.\n\nThe author's argument is that they've been independent for two years, which suggests they're capable of managing their own life. The refusal isn't about disrespect but about maintaining boundaries. The mother's request, while coming from a place of concern, doesn't seem to respect those boundaries. In most cases, parents don't have the right to monitor an adult child's phone without consent, especially if the child is paying for the service. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B, No.\n"
