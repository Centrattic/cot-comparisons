Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The parent wants a tracking app to see if they're using time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away, living in a secure campus, and they pay for their own phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. As an adult, the author has the right to privacy, especially since they're living independently and paying for their phone. Parents usually don't have the right to monitor an adult child's phone without consent. The parent's request seems invasive, especially given the author's independence.\n\nThe parent's mental health (bipolar disorder) is mentioned, which might contribute to overprotectiveness. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the demand for tracking. The author is in a safe environment with security measures, reducing the need for constant monitoring. Also, the author uses a weekend shuttle for essentials, so maybe the parent's concern isn't fully understanding their situation.\n\nIs there any cultural context? Sometimes, in some families, parental monitoring is more accepted, but the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" Legally and ethically, unless there's a specific reason (like a court order or if the author is under 18, which isn't stated), the author isn't obligated to comply. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because of privacy rights and independence as an adult.\n"
