Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants the author, a college student living far away, to install a tracking app so she can monitor their phone usage and location. The author feels their privacy is being invaded and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult college student, over 18, living independently. Parents usually have less authority over adult children. The mother's request might stem from concern, especially since the author is in a different city. But the author has valid privacy concerns. They pay for their phone, so the parent isn't contributing financially, which might make the tracking request more about control than necessity. Also, the author mentions their mother has bipolar disorder, which could affect her judgment or lead to overprotective behaviors.\n\nIs it normal for parents to track their adult children? It's a gray area. Some parents might do it out of worry, but respecting an adult's privacy is important. The author is setting boundaries, which is a healthy thing. Refusing to install the app isn't disrespectful; it's asserting personal space. The mother's reasoning about time management and safety might not justify the intrusion if the author is capable of managing their own affairs. The fact that the author isn't living at home anymore for two years also suggests they should have more independence. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy, especially since they're financially independent and an adult. The mother's request crosses a boundary here.\n"
