Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar. Am I really disrespectful for not downloading an app for her to monitor my phone usage and tract my location?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a college student who lives 700 miles away from home and pays for their own phone. Their mother wants them to install a tracking app so she can monitor their location and phone usage, claiming it's to check if they're using time effectively. The author is resisting, partly because they value their privacy and autonomy, especially since they don't live with their parents anymore and have their own responsibilities. They mention their mother has bipolar disorder, which might affect her perception of the situation.\n\nFirst, the age and independence factor: The author is in college, which is typically seen as a time of growing independence. Parents might have different expectations, but the child is now responsible for their own life. The fact that they pay for their phone themselves adds to the argument that they should have control over it.\n\nThen there's the privacy aspect. The mother wants to track the author's every move, which can be seen as overstepping, especially given the distance and the author's established independence. The author isn't in a dangerous area constantly, just some rough spots in major towns. The campus has security, so the safety concern might not be as dire as the mother thinks.\n\nThe mother's mental health is a complicating factor. Bipolar disorder can lead to mood swings and possibly overprotective or controlling behaviors, especially if the mother is in a manic or depressive phase. The author might be dealing with a parent who's struggling with their own issues, which isn't the author's fault. However, the mother's actions are still about her need to monitor, not necessarily the child's safety.\n\nIs the author disrespectful? The author is standing up for their boundaries. While the mother might feel hurt or neglected, the author's right to privacy in this situation seems valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are autonomy, privacy, and the mother's mental health. The author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when they're paying for the phone and managing their own life. The mother's request seems intrusive and unnecessary given the context.\n"
