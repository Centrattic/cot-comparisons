Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The main points from the scenario are that the person is a college student 700 miles away from home, has their own phone they pay for, and their mother wants them to install a tracking app to monitor their location and phone usage. The person is concerned about privacy and autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent's request is reasonable. The mother's concern might stem from wanting to check if the child is using their time effectively. But the child is an adult, living independently, and paying for their own phone. Parents usually have a right to concern, but when a child is an adult, especially in college, they typically have the right to privacy. The fact that the mother is bipolar adds another layer\u2014maybe her request is coming from an overprotective or anxiety-driven place, which isn't the child's responsibility to manage.\n\nThe child isn't in a dangerous area, though there are \"rough spots,\" but they use a shuttle and stay on a secure campus. The tracking app request might be excessive given the environment. Also, the child's argument about personal freedom and privacy is valid. Being an adult, they should have control over their own devices and personal life unless there's a specific safety issue. Since the parent isn't the one paying for the phone, their authority is even less. \n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong for refusing. The answer would likely be no because adults have the right to privacy. Unless there's a legal or safety concern, which isn't indicated here, the child isn't doing anything wrong. The mother's request oversteps, especially considering the distance and the child's independence. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
