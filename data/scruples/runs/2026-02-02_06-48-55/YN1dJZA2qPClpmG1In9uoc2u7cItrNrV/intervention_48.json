Now where I live isn't a bad area per say, but every major town has it's rough spots. I have paid for my phone for the past few months after buying a little straight talk smart phone. Not a big deal right? I like having data that I can use and being able to talk to who I want. (Not forced to talk to people I don't like). When I want is a big deal to.  I don't have a car so I get on the weekend shuttle to Walmart for essentially everything. I don't leave the locked in campus. (We have walls that Trump dreams about y'all)(two lines of police intercept people coming in). She still says she wants me to download this app so she can she where I am at all times. Is this normal? I haven't lived with her for two years and she is known to be bipolar.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their parents access their phone history. The situation is that the mother wants them to install a tracking app on their phone, which they pay for, to check if they're using their time effectively. The author is a college student 700 miles away, lives in a secure campus, doesn't have a car, and uses a shuttle. The parents are concerned about their safety, and the mother has bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an adult college student, living independently, which usually signals a move toward more autonomy. The parents' request for tracking could be seen as overstepping, especially since the child is paying for their own phone. Privacy is a big deal here. The mother's mental health might influence her behavior, but that doesn't necessarily justify the tracking without consent.\n\nThe author's reasons for not complying include autonomy, privacy, and the fact that they're not under the same roof anymore. The campus security mentioned suggests that the environment isn't dangerous, which might reduce the necessity of the tracking. However, parents often have safety concerns, even if the child is in a secure area.\n\nI need to balance the parents' concern for safety against the child's right to privacy. Since the author is an adult, their autonomy is important. Unless there's a specific safety issue that justifies such monitoring, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The mother's mental health might explain her behavior but doesn't make it right. The key here is whether the author is being disrespectful. Refusing to install the app is about personal boundaries, not disrespect. So, likely the author is not in the wrong.\n"
