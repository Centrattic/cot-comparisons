      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction as their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is saying there shouldn't be a reduction because the author makes more money. The author is paying more than 50% now and wants to adjust to 40% when the roommate's girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting rent when a third person moves in. Typically, if someone else is moving in, especially a partner, it's common for the rent to be split equally among all roommates. The original roommate is paying more because the author earns more, but when the girlfriend joins, the dynamic changes. The author is arguing that since they already pay more, they should adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset because he thinks the author should still pay the same higher percentage due to their income difference.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the roommate's income is lower, so maybe the roommate's partner would contribute to the rent. But maybe the author is assuming that the roommate's partner will help cover the rent, hence wanting to reduce their own share. However, the roommate might see it as unfair to lower the author's contribution just because someone else is moving in, especially if the author is already covering more. \n\nAnother angle is fairness. The author went to school and has student debt, while the roommate doesn't. The author might feel that their higher income is due to their education, so it's unfair to keep paying more than 50% when a third person is now sharing the space. However, the roommate might feel that the initial arrangement was based on their income disparity, and adding another person doesn't necessarily mean the split should change in a way that benefits the higher earner even more. \n\nThe key points here are fairness, contribution based on income, and how adding a third person affects the split. If the roommate's partner is moving in, it's common to have three people splitting the rent equally, but in this case, there are only two roommates. So the author is suggesting that the two of them adjust the split to account for the new person's presence. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, the split should remain as is. The author's counter is that the roommate's partner's presence changes the situation. But maybe the roommate is thinking that the author's higher income already justifies their current higher contribution, and adding the partner doesn't change the two-person dynamic. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot because they want to adjust the split to reflect the new living arrangement, but the roommate sees it as unfair to lower the author's share. However, if the roommate's partner is now living there, it's reasonable to expect that the rent should be split among three people. But the author is only suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the roommate and his partner together pay 60%, and the author pays 40%. If the original split was based on income, but the new arrangement is three people, maybe the author is right to adjust the split to a more equal share now that there's another person contributing. \n\nWait, but the roommate's partner isn't another roommate, so maybe the original two roommates are still the ones responsible for the rent. If the roommate's partner isn't contributing to the rent, then the author's argument that they should split the rent more equally (40-60) when the roommate has someone else living there could be valid. Because the author is essentially covering more due to their higher income, but if the roommate's partner isn't paying rent, then the author is subsidizing the roommate's living expenses more. \n\nSo in that case, the author's request for a more balanced split might be fair. The roommate might be resistant because they don't want to adjust the split based on income, but the author is pointing out that they already pay more now and should pay less when the roommate has a partner. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to adjust the split to be fairer given the new circumstances. The roommate's refusal might be based on a misunderstanding of how shared living arrangements typically work when a partner moves in. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
