      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The author currently pays more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants the rent split 40-60 (them paying 40%, the roommate and his girlfriend 60%). The roommate is upset about this suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent when a new person moves in. Normally, when someone new joins, the rent is divided among all three people. But the author is suggesting keeping the split between the existing two roommates and not accounting for the new person. That might not be fair because the new person is contributing as well. If the rent is split three ways, each person would pay about a third. But the author is proposing a 40-60 split between themselves and the roommate, which effectively means the author is still paying more than their share once the third person is included. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they pay more now because they earn more. But when a third person is added, maybe the split should be equal unless there's a different arrangement. The roommate might be frustrated because the author is trying to maintain an unequal split even with three people. \n\nAnother point is the roommate's implication that there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more. The author feels this is unfair since they have student debt. But the roommate might be thinking that the new person is contributing, so the total amount paid by the two existing roommates should adjust accordingly. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the standard is to split the rent equally among all roommates, then the author's suggestion of 40-60 between them and the roommate (instead of three-way split) might not be fair. The roommate could be justified in being upset because the author is trying to keep a higher share of the rent without considering the new person's contribution. Therefore, the author might be the asshole here by not adjusting the split fairly when a third person is added.\n"
