I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author earns more. The author argues they already pay more than 50% due to higher income and different financial backgrounds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or agreed upon terms. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the author feels the rent should be adjusted. The author suggests a 40-60 split, which would mean the author pays less, but the roommate is upset.\n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the author earns more, they shouldn't get a discount. The author counters that they already pay more than 50% and have student debt. The key points here are about fairness, contribution based on income, and existing financial obligations.\n\nIn most roommate situations, splitting rent proportionally to income is common. If the author's income is higher, they might be expected to cover more than half. However, when the roommate's partner moves in, the expectation might shift. The author wants to adjust the split so they pay 40%, which is less than before. The roommate's anger comes from the idea that the author is getting a better deal because of their higher income.\n\nBut wait, the author already pays more than 50% now. If the roommate's partner moves in, the total rent might stay the same, but the number of people increases. However, typically, roommates don't split rent based on the number of people, but on income. If the author's income is higher, they might still pay more even with the partner. However, the author wants to reduce their share to 40%, which is less than their current contribution. That could be seen as unfair because the roommate's income hasn't changed, but the author is asking for a lower share. \n\nThe roommate's frustration is valid because the author is reducing their payment despite having a higher income. The author's arguments about student debt and education don't directly affect the roommate's ability to pay. The main issue is whether the split should be based on income regardless of other factors. \n\nSo, the author is asking for a lower share despite earning more, which might not be fair. The roommate has a right to be upset if the author is asking to pay less when they have a higher income. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
