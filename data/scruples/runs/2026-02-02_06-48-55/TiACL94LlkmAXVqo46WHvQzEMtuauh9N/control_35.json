He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the author wanting a rent reduction. The roommate is splitting rent unevenly because the author earns more. The author argues that since they already pay more than 50%, and they have student debt, it's unfair to not adjust the split when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. They suggested 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The original split was based on income, with the higher earner paying more. Now, when the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the author wants to adjust the split again. The roommate is resisting, arguing that the income disparity remains. \n\nIs the author justified? Rent splits can be based on various factors like income, but when a new person moves in, it's common to adjust the split. However, if the new person isn't contributing to the rent, that might change the split. The author is suggesting a lower share because they already pay more than 50%, which might be reasonable if the roommate's side has increased. But if the roommate is splitting the rent with his girlfriend, maybe the total amount each person is paying would change. However, the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a reduction. \n\nThe author's arguments are about fairness based on their educational investment and debt versus the roommate's lack of debt. That could be a personal point but might not directly affect the rent split. The main issue is the distribution of rent when the roommate's living situation changes. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in and they're still splitting the rent the same way, maybe the author is justified in wanting a lower share. However, if the roommate's income is still higher, the original split could be maintained unless the new roommate is contributing. \n\nBut maybe the key point is that the author is not being unreasonable in seeking a fair split when the living arrangement changes. The roommate's implication that the split shouldn't change because the author earns more might be the issue here. The author is trying to adjust for the new person's presence, which typically would affect the rent split. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to adjust. The answer would be B.\n"
