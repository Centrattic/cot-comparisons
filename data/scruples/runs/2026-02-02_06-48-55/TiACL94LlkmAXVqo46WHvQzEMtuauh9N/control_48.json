      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author is paying more than 50% now due to their higher income and wants to adjust to a 40-60 split when the girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, the fairness aspect. Rent splits are often based on income or agreed-upon shares. The author currently pays more because they earn more. Now, with the girlfriend moving in, the roommate wants to keep the same arrangement, maybe assuming the new person's presence doesn't affect the split. The author argues that with three people, the split should adjust, especially since they want a 40-60 split (so the roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%). But the roommate is upset about this.\n\nIs the author wrong? Rent splits are typically agreed upon by all roommates. If the current arrangement is based on income, but introducing a third person changes the dynamics, the author has a right to renegotiate. However, the author's request might depend on whether the roomie's girlfriend will be contributing to the rent. If she's part of the household, maybe the total rent should be split among three people. But the author's argument is that they want to pay less than 50% because they earn more. That's a bit conflicting\u2014if they're already paying more now, reducing their share might not be fair unless the others are contributing more. Also, the roommate's objection is that the author makes more, but the author is suggesting they pay less relative to their income, which seems contradictory. However, if the new arrangement would have two people (roommate and girlfriend) paying 60% together, that might be fair if they're sharing the cost. The roommate being upset might be because he doesn't want his share to decrease. The author is in a position where they have student debt and higher income, which they might need to prioritize. It's about mutual agreement. The roommate's implication that there shouldn't be a reduction is problematic because the addition of a third person typically affects the split. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting a renegotiation. The key is whether the new arrangement is fair considering all factors. Since the roomie is resistant without considering the new household structure, the author isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
