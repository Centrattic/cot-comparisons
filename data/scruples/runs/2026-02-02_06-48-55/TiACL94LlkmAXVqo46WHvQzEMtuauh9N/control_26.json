I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and a request for a rent reduction.\n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The author currently pays more than 50% of the rent because they earn more. The roommate says there should be no rent reduction, but the author wants to adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset.\n\nThe main points the author makes are that they already pay more because of their higher income, and they have student debt while the roommate doesn't. They argue it's unfair for the roommate to not adjust the split when the girlfriend moves in. They proposed the roommate and his girlfriend pay 60%, and the author 40%.\n\nNow, considering fairness. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that's adding another person to the household. Typically, when more people move in, the rent per person decreases. But the author is saying they already pay more because of their higher income. However, the roommate's argument is that since the author earns more, the rent shouldn't be reduced. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they have higher expenses (student debt) and the roommate doesn't. The author is trying to adjust the split to reflect their current financial situation, not just income. Maybe the roommate thinks the rent should stay the same because the author makes more, but the author thinks the presence of another person should reduce their share. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the roommate was previously paying less because they earn less, but now there are two people (roommate + girlfriend), splitting the rent more equally makes sense. The author is adjusting the split based on the new household composition. If the original arrangement was based on income, but now there's another person, changing the split could be fair. However, the roommate might feel that the author is trying to take advantage of their higher income regardless of the new situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rent itself is being reduced because the roommate and his girlfriend can split the cost, so the author is expecting a lower personal contribution. But if the total rent stays the same, the split is just being adjusted. The roommate might feel that since the author is earning more, they should still pay a larger share. \n\nI think the author's argument has merit. They are considering the new household structure and their own financial responsibilities. The roommate's argument seems to ignore the fact that adding another person should reduce each person's share. So the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
