      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the original poster (OP) wants a rent reduction. They currently split the rent, but OP pays more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate says there shouldn't be a rent reduction even if the girlfriend moves in because OP makes more money. OP feels this is unfair because they have student debt and the roommate doesn't. They suggested a 40-60 split, but the roommate is mad.\n\nFirst, when someone moves in, typically the rent might be adjusted. If the roommate's girlfriend is joining, maybe they need to consider how the rent is split among three people now. But the original question is about whether the rent should be reduced for the OP. If the roommate and his girlfriend are sharing the apartment, maybe the OP's share should decrease because there are now two more people contributing? Wait, but the apartment's total rent might stay the same. If the roommate and his girlfriend are moving in, maybe the rent is still the same, but the OP is sharing with two more people. Or maybe the total rent increases? The question isn't clear on that. But OP is saying that if the girlfriend moves in, they (the roommate and his girlfriend) should pay more, hence OP can pay less. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that because OP makes more money, the split shouldn't change. But OP argues that they already pay more than 50% now. So if the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the three of them (OP, roommate, and his girlfriend) would be sharing the rent. If the total rent is the same, then maybe splitting three ways would mean OP pays less. But if the total rent increases because of a new person, that's different. The problem is the roommate isn't considering a rent reduction for OP, even though OP's share would decrease if there are three people. \n\nIs it fair for OP to ask for a lower share? If the rent is split three ways, then yes, OP's share would be less. The roommate might be thinking that since OP earns more, they should pay more, but if the roommate and his girlfriend are two people contributing, maybe their combined income is higher. But OP's point is that they already pay more than 50%, implying that the current split isn't based on income but just because OP makes more. \n\nThe roommate's girlfriend moving in might not increase the total rent, so the OP is asking to adjust the split to reflect the new number of people. The roommate is resistant because OP makes more. However, fairness could be based on the number of people rather than income. If the apartment is for one more person, maybe the rent is split three ways. Alternatively, if the roommate and his girlfriend are considered one unit, maybe they pay a larger share. \n\nOP's argument is that they have student debt and the roommate doesn't, which adds another layer. But financially, the main issue is the split. If the roommate is okay with paying more because they make less, but when the girlfriend moves in, the roommate wants to keep OP's share the same, that's unfair because now there are three people. \n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? Probably not. They want a fairer split based on the new number of roommates. The roommate is being unreasonable by not considering the adjustment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
