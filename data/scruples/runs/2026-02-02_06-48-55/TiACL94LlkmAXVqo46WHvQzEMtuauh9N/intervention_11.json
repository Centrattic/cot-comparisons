      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the rent split.\n\nFirst, the author pays more now because they earn more. They propose a 40-60 split if the girlfriend moves in, which would mean the author pays less than their current share. The roommate is upset because they think the author should still pay more due to higher income.\n\nHmm, fairness in rent splitting usually depends on the agreement between roommates. If the original arrangement was based on income, then changing it when a new person moves in might require renegotiation. The author's argument is that with three people now, splitting equally (or adjusting based on income) is fair. The roommate might feel that since the author earns more, they should still pay a larger share even with the new person. \n\nBut wait, when someone else moves in, typically the rent is split among all occupants. So if the girlfriend is moving in, it's three people now. The author wants to adjust the split to 40% for them and 60% for the two others. The original split might have been two people, so adding a third would mean a third each if equal. But the author's higher income was a factor before. \n\nThe roommate might be upset because they think the author's income still justifies a bigger share. The author is arguing that since the income disparity exists and the new person is coming, splitting equally isn't fair. But maybe the standard is that when a new person moves in, the rent is split equally among all roommates unless there's a prior agreement. \n\nSo, the author is suggesting a different split based on income, but maybe that's not standard practice. Roommate agreements can vary, but typically, unless specified otherwise, adding a roommate would mean splitting the rent equally. The author might be in the right to adjust the split considering the new person, but the roommate's argument is about income. If the original agreement was based on income, changing it might be reasonable. However, the author's request could be seen as trying to get a lower share despite their higher income, which the roommate might find unfair. \n\nBut the author's point is that they already pay more than 50% now, and with the new person, splitting equally would mean they pay less. It's a matter of how the initial agreement was set up. If the original split was based on income, then the author's request to adjust might make sense. However, the roommate might feel that the income difference should still be a factor. \n\nI think the key here is whether the initial agreement was based on income or just a 50-50 split. If it was income-based, then the author's request is reasonable. If it was a 50-50 split regardless of income, then adding a third person would mean splitting three ways equally. The author's frustration is valid if the initial arrangement was based on income. However, suggesting a 40-60 split when there are three people might not be standard. Maybe a third each? But the author wants to pay 40%, which is less than their current share. The roommate is mad because they think the author should pay more. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they had a prior agreement based on income. But if the standard is equal split when there are more people, then maybe the author is being unreasonable. The roommate's anger might stem from feeling that the income should still be a factor. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're adjusting the split based on the new circumstances and their initial arrangement. However, the answer depends on the original agreement. Since the original split was based on income, the author's request is fair. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
