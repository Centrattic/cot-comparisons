      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate wants a rent adjustment. The author is paying more than 50% because they make more money. The roommate claims there should be no rent reduction because the author makes more, but the author argues they already pay more and should get a better split now that the roommate has a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split based on income or agreed upon terms. The original split was based on income differences, which is common. When a new person moves in (the girlfriend), the dynamics change. Usually, couples might split their share between them, but how does that affect the existing roommate?\n\nThe author suggests moving to a 40-60 split where they pay 40% and the roommate and his girlfriend split the remaining 60%. That would mean the author is paying less than before. The roommate is upset because the author's higher income was a factor in the original split. The author's argument is that since the roommate's income isn't mentioned, maybe the new arrangement should be based on the number of people, not income. But the original arrangement was based on income, so changing the basis could be unfair to the roommate.\n\nIn many cases, roommates agree on a split based on income to account for financial situations. If the roommate's income isn't higher, but the author's is, then the income-based split makes sense. However, when a new person moves in, maybe the split should adjust to account for the couple's combined income versus the single roommate's. But since the original split was based on individual incomes, maybe the author is right to adjust the split because now there are two people sharing the cost.\n\nBut the problem is the roommate is implying that because the author makes more, they should continue to pay a larger share. However, when the girlfriend moves in, the roommate's side has two people, so maybe the split should be adjusted accordingly. The typical approach might be to split the rent among the number of people, but if the original split was based on income, that complicates things.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the roommate has a partner moving in, the cost should be split more evenly. But the roommate might argue that the original split was based on income, and since the author's income is higher, they should still contribute more. However, if the roommate and his girlfriend are splitting the rent between them, the author's share might logically decrease if the total is split by the number of people. But if the original split was based on income, changing it now without considering income could be unfair.\n\nI think the key here is whether the original agreement was based on income and if that's still a fair basis. If the roommate has a partner, maybe the total cost should be split among three people (author, roommate, girlfriend), but the roommate's side splits their share between two. However, the original split was 50-50 adjusted for income, so the author is paying more. Now, with two people on the roommate's side, maybe the author's share should decrease. But the roommate is resisting because the author's income is higher. \n\nThe author's argument is that the roommate's income isn't mentioned, so maybe it's a factor. If the roommate's income is lower than the girlfriend's, combined their income might be higher than the author's. But if the roommate's income is the same as before, the author's higher income is still a factor. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because when a new person moves in, it's reasonable to adjust the rent split to account for the increased number of people. However, the original split was based on income, so changing it without considering income might be unfair. The author is trying to adjust based on the number of people, which is a common approach, but the roommate is clinging to the income-based split. \n\nBut the roommate's side now has two people, so maybe their share should be split between two, making the author's share lower. However, the original split was based on income, so if the author's income is higher, they might still pay more. But with two people on the roommate's side, maybe the total should be adjusted. \n\nI think the author is in the right because when a new person moves in, the rent split should adjust to account for the number of people. The roommate's insistence on keeping the income-based split without considering the change in the number of housemates is the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
