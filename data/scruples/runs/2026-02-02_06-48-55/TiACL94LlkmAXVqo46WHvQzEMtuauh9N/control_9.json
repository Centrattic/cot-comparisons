      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is the asshole for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying that there shouldn't be any rent reduction because the poster makes more money. The poster argues that they already pay more than 50% due to their higher income and different financial situations (education, student debt). They suggested a 40-60 split, which upset the roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or agreed-upon percentages. The poster already pays more because they earn more, which is a common practice. When the roommate's girlfriend moves in, it becomes a three-person household, so the rent structure might need adjustment. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the poster makes more, they shouldn't get a discount. But the poster is saying that when the girlfriend moves in, the rent should be split among three people. If the rent doesn't change, but now there are three people living there, the poster might expect the split to change. However, if the total rent remains the same, splitting it differently is reasonable. \n\nThe poster's reasoning is based on current contributions and future changes. They want to maintain a fair split considering the new roommate. The roommate being upset might be because they expected the existing arrangement to stay. The key points are: existing unequal split based on income, introduction of a third person, and the poster adjusting the split again. \n\nIs the poster in the wrong? If they were already paying more due to higher income, then adding a third person would logically require a new arrangement. The 40-60 split might not account for three people, unless the girlfriend is contributing. But the post doesn't mention the girlfriend's contribution. If the roommate's share is now split between him and his girlfriend, the poster's 40% might be fair if the total rent is split among three. However, without knowing if the girlfriend is paying any rent, it's hard to assess. \n\nIf the total rent remains the same, but now there are three people, the fair split would be per person. If each person should pay an equal share, then the total is divided by three. Alternatively, if the roommate and his girlfriend together pay the same as before, but the poster pays more, that might not be fair. \n\nThe poster's initial argument about the income difference and student debt is a valid point about their financial responsibilities. The roommate's implication that income should override the new roommate situation might not be fair. The poster is trying to adjust the split to account for the additional person, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the asshole) because the poster is adjusting the split based on the new living arrangement and their own financial circumstances, which is a fair approach.\n"
