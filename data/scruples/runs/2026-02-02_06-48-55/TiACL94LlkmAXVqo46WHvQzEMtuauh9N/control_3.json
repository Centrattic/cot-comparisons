I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the roommate's girlfriend wants to move in, and the author is asking for a rent reduction because they're paying more than 50% currently. The roommate is against it, saying that since the author makes more money, there shouldn't be a rent reduction.\n\nFirst, the original rent split was based on their income. The author pays more because they earn more. Now, with the roommate's girlfriend moving in, the dynamics are changing. The author suggests a 40-60 split instead of the previous arrangement, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nI need to consider fairness here. When a new person moves in, typically the rent might be split among the new number of people. If the roomie's girlfriend is moving in, maybe the total rent is the same, but now three people are sharing it. But the original question is about the split between the author and the roommate. Wait, the original split was 50-50 but adjusted based on income. Now, with the girlfriend moving in, the author wants to adjust it to 40-60. The roommate is resisting because the author makes more.\n\nIs it fair to adjust the split when the number of roommates increases? If the total rent is split among three people, maybe the author's share would naturally go down. But the roommate isn't proposing a rent reduction; he's saying the author should still pay more because they earn more. The author is arguing that since there are now three people, they should pay a smaller percentage. The roommate is being resistant because he's not considering the new dynamic. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they already pay more than 50% before, and with another person joining, their share should decrease. The roommate is implying that the author's higher income justifies them paying more. But maybe once the girlfriend is there, the original two-roommate split isn't applicable anymore. So the author is trying to adjust the split to account for the new person, which seems reasonable. The roommate's anger might be because he doesn't want to adjust the split, possibly expecting the author to still pay a larger share even with more people. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have student debt and higher education, which might affect their financial situation. The roommate's lack of debt and lower income could mean he's in a better position to cover a larger share now that there are three people. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're trying to adjust the split to be fairer given the new circumstances. The roommate is being resistant without considering the new situation. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
