      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is the asshole. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the user currently pays more than half the rent because they earn more. The roommate argues that there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the user makes more money, but the user is upset about it. The user suggested paying 40% and the roommate and his girlfriend paying 60%, which is a bigger split than equal. The roommate got mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The user already pays more because of their higher income, so when another person moves in, splitting the rent equally would change the dynamics. The user wants the rent split based on income or the number of people. However, typically, when someone moves in, the rent is often split equally unless otherwise agreed. The user's argument is that their higher income shouldn't mean they have to pay more when there are now two people sharing. But the roommate is upset because the user is asking for a lower percentage, maybe feeling that the user's higher income isn't the issue here. \n\nThe roommate's girlfriend moving in increases the number of people, so splitting rent equally would mean three people paying the same, but the user is suggesting a 40-60 split, which is a bigger share for the roommate's side. That might not make sense if the total rent is being split among three people. Wait, if two people move in, the total number is three? Wait, original situation: the user and roommate live together. Then the roommate's girlfriend moves in, making three people. So the rent was split between two, now among three. The user suggests paying 40% (so their share decreases from ~50% to 40%), while the roommate and his girlfriend would split 60% (each paying 30% if split equally). But the user's argument is that they already paid more than 50% before, and now with three people, they want a lower percentage. But if the rent is split equally among three, each would pay about 33%. However, the user is suggesting paying 40% when the roommate's side would pay 60% combined. That doesn't align with the number of people. So perhaps the user is complicating it by basing it on income instead of just splitting evenly per person.\n\nThe roommate might think that the presence of the girlfriend doesn't affect the split unless they agree to an adjustment. The user's reasoning about income and education might not be directly relevant to splitting rent. Typically, roommates split based on agreement, not income. So if the user wants a different split, they need to negotiate. However, the roommate is upset because the user is changing the terms based on income, which might not be fair. The user's argument that they have student debt is a personal financial situation, but the roommate's girlfriend moving in is a new factor. The user is asking for a rent reduction because the roommate's side now has two people, but splitting based on income can be subjective. Maybe the user is in the right because they want to adjust the split to be fairer when there are more people, but maybe not because it's not standard to adjust based on income. Alternatively, the roommate is in the right if the original agreement was based on income, but the user is trying to change it. The answer would depend on the original agreement and fairness. If the original split was based on income, then the user has a point because adding someone changes the dynamic. But if the split was supposed to be per-person, then the user is wrong. Since the user already pays more before, adding a person might not justify a lower split unless agreed. The roommate being mad might be because the user is suggesting an unequal split without considering the number of people. So maybe the user is not in the wrong because they're adjusting for the new person, but the roommate is upset because the user's proposal isn't fair. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. I think the user is not in the wrong because they're trying to adjust the rent split based on the new situation, but the roommate is upset because the user is not splitting it equally per person. However, if the original split was based on income, then the user might have a valid point. But if the standard is to split equally, the user is complicating it. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because the user is trying to adjust for fairness given the new roommate, but the roommate is resistant without a good reason.\n"
