I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues that they already pay more than 50% and want to adjust to 40% if the roommate's partner moves in.\n\nFirst, consider the initial split. The current split is unequal because the author earns more, which is fair if they've agreed to a pro-rata split based on income. Now, when the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the living situation changes. Typically, when a new person moves in, the rent might be adjusted. But the author is asking for a reduction to 40%, while the roommate is upset.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The current split is already uneven, which the author might have agreed to based on their income.\n2. The author is now suggesting a new split (40-60) when the roommate's partner moves in, which could be seen as the author trying to benefit from the roommate's relationship without considering the existing arrangement.\n\nThe roommate might feel that the new person (girlfriend) is an additional person living there, so the rent should be adjusted for three people instead of two. However, the author is not asking for a reduction because of an extra person but because of their income. It's possible the author is trying to shift the financial burden again, which the roommate perceives as unfair, especially since the roommate's income hasn't changed.\n\nAlso, the author's justification about their student debt and education might not directly relate to the fairness of the rent split unless the original agreement was based on income. The roommate's partner moving in doesn't change the author's income; the author is just adjusting the split because they want to pay less, possibly to balance future expenses. However, this could be seen as the author exploiting the roommate's situation to get a better deal for themselves, hence the roommate's anger.\n\nIn most roommate situations, rent splits are based on income or agreed upon percentages. If the original split was based on income, changing it just because someone else moves in might not be fair unless the new person is contributing to the rent. The author's request might be seen as self-serving without considering the roommate's perspective. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong here because they're altering the agreement based on their own circumstances without mutual agreement, leading to conflict.\n"
