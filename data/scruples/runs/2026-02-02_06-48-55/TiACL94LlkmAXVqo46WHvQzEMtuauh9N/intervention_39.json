I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate whose girlfriend wants to move in, and the original poster (OP) wants a rent reduction. The roommate argues that since the OP makes more money, there shouldn't be a rent reduction. The OP feels it's unfair because they already pay more than 50% due to their higher income and different financial situations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent when a new person moves in. Typically, when a roommate's partner joins, it might be expected that the rent is split among three people, but in this case, it seems the OP wants a new split where they pay 40% and the roommate and his girlfriend split 60%. The roommate is upset about this suggestion. \n\nThe key points here are income disparity, existing split, and the introduction of a third person. The OP already pays more than 50% based on their higher income and student debt. The roommate's argument is that since the OP earns more, the rent shouldn't be reduced. But the OP's reasoning is that adding another person should reduce their share, regardless of income. \n\nLegally, unless there's a written agreement, roommates can adjust the split as they agree. However, the fairness can be subjective. The roommate might feel that the OP is trying to change the existing arrangement without considering the new dynamics. The OP might be correct in wanting a fairer split based on the number of people, but the roommate's perspective is that their individual circumstances (like income) should still dictate the split. \n\nI think the OP isn't wrong in wanting a fairer split, but maybe didn't consider the roommate's viewpoint. The roommate's frustration could stem from feeling that the OP is imposing a new split without considering their agreement. However, the initial split was based on income, which might not be the best approach when another person is added. The OP's request is reasonable, but communication might be an issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the OP isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. Maybe it's a B, not in the wrong.\n"
