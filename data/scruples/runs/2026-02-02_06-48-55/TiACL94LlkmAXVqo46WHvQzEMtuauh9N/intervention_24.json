I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, and the original poster (OP) wants a rent reduction. The OP pays more than 50% because they make more money. The roommate says there shouldn't be a reduction because the OP earns more, but the OP argues they already pay a higher share, have student debt, and went to school longer. The OP suggested a 40-60 split, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or other agreements. The OP already pays more than 50% initially. When the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the total number of roommates increases, which might mean the rent would be split among three people. But the OP is suggesting a 40% share for themselves and 60% for the couple. \n\nThe original split was based on income, but now with three people, maybe the split should adjust. However, the OP is asking for a lower percentage because they make more. That seems counterintuitive. Usually, higher earners might pay a larger share, but in this case, the OP is asking to pay less relative to the new split. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the OP makes more, they shouldn't get a reduction. But the OP's counter is that they already pay more and have student debt. However, the suggested 40-60 split would mean the OP pays less than before if the total rent remains the same. That might not be fair if the roommate's income is lower. \n\nAnother angle: when the girlfriend moves in, does the total rent stay the same? If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in as a new roommate, maybe the total rent doesn't change, but the number of people paying increases. However, sometimes when someone moves in, the rent might increase, but that's not mentioned here. The OP is assuming that the rent will be split among three, but maybe the roommate's idea is that the couple would split their share, keeping the OP's payment the same. \n\nThe OP is trying to adjust the split based on their higher income, but if the roommate's girlfriend is also contributing, perhaps the total income of the couple is higher than the OP's. The OP's suggestion of 40-60 might be a way to have the couple pay more, but if they're two people, splitting 60% between them would mean each pays 30%, which might be unfair if their combined income is lower than the OP's. \n\nThe roommate is upset because the OP is asking for a lower share despite earning more. The roommate might feel that the OP should maintain the current higher share or maybe even increase it. The OP's reasoning about student debt and education is personal but doesn't directly affect the fairness of the rent split. \n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? If the rent is being split among three people, and the OP is asking to pay less than their previous share, that could be seen as not considering the roommate's perspective. The roommate might have expected the OP to maintain their current contribution since they earn more. The OP's suggestion might be seen as exploiting the situation to pay less, even though they have a higher income. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the request might not be fair considering the roommate's position and the typical way rent is split based on income.\n"
