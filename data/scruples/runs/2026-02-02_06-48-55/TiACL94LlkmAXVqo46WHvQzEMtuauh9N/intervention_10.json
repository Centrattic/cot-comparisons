I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate wanting a rent reduction when his girlfriend moves in, but the roommate says there shouldn't be a reduction because the author earns more. The author feels it's unfair since they already pay more than 50% and have student debt, while the roommate doesn't. They proposed a 40-60 split, but the roommate got mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in roommate situations. Typically, rent splits are based on agreements between the roommates, and factors like income can play a role. However, when a new person moves in, the dynamics might change. If the roommate is bringing his girlfriend into the shared space, does that require a different arrangement? Maybe the girlfriend will be occupying a room, which could mean the rent structure needs to change. But sometimes, if the girlfriend isn't paying rent, the existing roommates might have to adjust their shares.\n\nThe author already pays more than 50% because they make more. The roommate is implying that the rent shouldn't be reduced, possibly because the author's higher income justifies the higher contribution. But the author argues that since they went to school and have debt, they should pay less now that the roommate is bringing someone in. The roommate's reaction is being mad, so the question is whether the author's request is reasonable or if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the roommate is adding another person to the household, it's customary to adjust the rent split. However, the adjustment depends on whether the new person is contributing to the rent. If the girlfriend isn't paying, then the existing roommates might need to cover her share. If the original roommate's share was part of a 50-50 or 50-50 plus something arrangement, bringing in a non-paying person could mean the other roommate is subsidizing both. The author's request to reduce their percentage to 40% is trying to account for that.\n\nBut the roommate is upset. Is the author wrong? If the original agreement was based on income, then the author's higher payment is justified. However, when the roommate's personal situation changes (adding a partner), the author is asking to realign the split to reflect the new living situation. This seems reasonable because the roommate is introducing an additional person who might use shared resources. The author isn't demanding a reduction based solely on their own debt but on the changed circumstances and the existing split.\n\nBut maybe the roommate is right to be upset if the original agreement was based on income. The author's contribution could be based on their ability to pay, not just the number of occupants. However, if the roommate is bringing in a partner, the author might feel that the living arrangement is now different, so the split should adjust. It's a bit of a gray area. But the key point is that the author is asking for a change in the split due to the roommate's addition of a partner, which is a common request. The roommate's implication that the author should still pay more because they earn more might not consider the new dynamic. So the author's stance could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
