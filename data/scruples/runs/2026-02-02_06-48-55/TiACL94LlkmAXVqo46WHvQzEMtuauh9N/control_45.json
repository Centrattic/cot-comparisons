      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is the asshole. They already pay more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate says there should be no rent reduction because the author makes more money, but the author feels it's unfair since they have student debt and higher earnings.\n\nHmm. So, the core issue is fairness in rent splitting when a new person moves in. Typically, when a roommate adds someone else, the rent is divided among more people. If the original split was based on income, maybe the author was paying more because their income is higher. But if the roommate's setup is that they split 50-50 regardless of income, and the author was already covering more than half, then adding another person complicates things.\n\nThe author is suggesting a 40-60 split (so the roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%), but the roommate is upset. The roommate might argue that the author's higher income means they can still afford to pay more, but the author is concerned about their financial burden, especially with student debt. \n\nI need to think about common practices. In many cases, when a new roommate joins, the rent is divided equally among all. But if the original agreement was based on income differences, then maybe the author is justified in wanting the split to adjust. The problem is, if the original roommate wasn't aware of the income-based split, the author might have an issue. However, the user mentions that the roommate is implying no rent reduction because the author makes more. That seems to ignore the fact that the author was already paying more than their share when it was just the two of them. \n\nThe author's reasons are valid: they pay more already, and they have student debt. The roommate's stance might be seen as not considering the author's financial situation. So, is the author the asshole? Probably not, because they're trying to adjust the split to reflect the new number of people. The roommate's implication that the author shouldn't get a reduction because they earn more could be the problem here. The author is asking for a fairer split based on the new number of occupants, not just their income. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're adjusting the split to account for three people living there, which is a common practice. The roommate might be in the wrong by not being flexible. The author's reasoning about their own financial responsibilities is also a factor, but the main point is the number of people sharing the space, not just income differences.\n"
