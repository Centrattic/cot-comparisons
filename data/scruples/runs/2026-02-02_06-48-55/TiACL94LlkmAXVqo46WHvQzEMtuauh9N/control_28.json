I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is arguing that since the author makes more money, there shouldn't be any rent reduction. The author is saying they already pay more than 50% because they earn more, and they want to adjust the split to 40-60 when the girlfriend moves in.\n\nHmm. So the original split was based on income, which is common. When the roommate's partner moves in, the author wants the rent split to change. The roommate is upset because the author is suggesting a lower share. The author's reasoning is that they have more student debt and higher income, so it's unfair to keep paying a higher percentage when there's another person in the apartment.\n\nI need to consider fairness in roommate arrangements. Typically, when someone moves in, the rent might be adjusted. If the roommate's partner is moving in, they might expect to cover their share. However, the original split was income-based. The author is asking if they should get a lower share now that there's another person, but the roommate is not agreeing because the author makes more. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's request is based on the idea that with three people, the rent should be split differently. But if the roommate's partner is moving in, maybe the roommate and his partner would take on more of the rent. But the author's argument is that they already paid more before, and now with the new person, they want a lower share. \n\nThe roommate might feel that the initial agreement was fair based on income, and the author is now changing the terms without a valid reason. The author's points about student debt and higher income are valid, but the roommate's implication is that since the author makes more, they should continue paying more. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common to adjust the split based on income or other factors. However, the author's suggestion of 40-60 might be reasonable if the roommate and his partner are now two people, so they could cover more. But if the total rent isn't changing, maybe the author is just trying to lower their share regardless. \n\nWait, the total rent is the same, but with three people, each person's share might be adjusted. However, if the roommate's partner is moving in, the author might expect the roommate to cover more, but the original split was based on income. The author is suggesting that with the new person, the split should be adjusted. However, the roommate is resisting because the author makes more. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is justified in asking for a lower share despite their higher income. If the total rent remains the same, and the roommate is adding a partner, perhaps the author is correct in thinking that the roommate and his partner should cover a larger portion. But the roommate's argument is that the author already pays more because they make more, so why change it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid point about the initial split being based on income and the unfairness of continuing that split when another person is added. The roommate's partner will need to contribute, so adjusting the split makes sense. The author's reasoning about their debt and education is also a personal factor. The roommate's being mad might be because he doesn't want to adjust the split despite the new circumstances. So answer B.\n"
