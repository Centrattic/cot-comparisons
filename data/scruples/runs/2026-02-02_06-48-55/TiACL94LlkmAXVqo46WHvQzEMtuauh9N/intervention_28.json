      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is saying there shouldn't be a reduction because the AITA person makes more money. The AITA person already pays more than 50% due to their higher income. They proposed a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nHmm. The main points are fairness in rent splitting when a third person moves in. Typically, when someone new moves in, the rent is split among more people. But here, it's a roommate's girlfriend, so maybe the original two are still splitting the rent, but with the roommate getting help from his girlfriend. The AITA person feels they should pay less because the roommate has more support. But the roommate argues that because the AITA earns more, they should still pay more.\n\nI need to consider standard roommate agreements. Usually, everyone contributes equally if they're all splitting the rent. But if the girlfriend is moving in, maybe the room arrangement changes. If the girlfriend is occupying a room, the rent might be split three ways. However, the original scenario says the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the AITA is asking for a reduction because they already pay more than 50%. The roommate is saying no reduction because of the money disparity.\n\nThe AITA person's argument is that since the roommate's partner is moving in, the rent should be adjusted. They propose a 40-60 split. But the roommate is upset. Is this fair? Well, the roommate's income is lower, so maybe the initial split was based on income. If the roommate has a partner now, maybe their combined income is higher, so the AITA could argue that the rent split should adjust. However, the roommate might not be responsible for their partner's income in a roommate arrangement. \n\nIt's also possible that the roommate's partner isn't part of the rent agreement. If the room arrangement doesn't change (same number of rooms), then maybe the rent split should stay the same. But if the girlfriend is getting a room, then it's three people. The problem is that the AITA already pays more than 50%, and now wants to pay less. The roommate is resisting because of their higher income. \n\nIs the AITA in the wrong? If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in and the rent is split among three, the AITA might expect to pay less. But if the split remains two people, then maybe the original arrangement holds. However, the question is whether the AITA is wrong to want a reduction. The roommate is mad because the AITA is asking for a lower split despite making more. If the roommate's partner is contributing to the rent, then the split could change. But if not, maybe the AITA's request is reasonable. \n\nI think the key here is whether the presence of the roommate's girlfriend affects the number of people sharing the rent. If the total number of roommates increases, then the rent would be split more. But if it's still two roommates, the split might stay the same. The AITA's argument is about fairness in the split based on income, but traditional roommate splits are often equal unless agreed otherwise. The AITA's proposal to pay 40% might be seen as unfair if the roommate's income is lower, but maybe they can adjust the split based on income. However, the roommate might not want to adjust because they think the AITA should pay more due to higher income. \n\nIn typical roommate scenarios, equal splits are the norm. If the AITA is already paying more due to income, but now wants to pay less when the roommate has a partner, that might be seen as shifting the burden. The roommate might feel that the initial arrangement was fair, and the AITA is now trying to renegotiate. So maybe the AITA is in the wrong for expecting a reduction when the roommate's partner moving in doesn't necessarily affect the number of people paying rent. Unless the room count changes, the split might stay the same. Therefore, the answer might be A (the AITA is in the wrong).\n"
