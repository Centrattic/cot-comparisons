I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2.

I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction because they already pay more than 50% due to higher income. The roommate is saying there should be no rent reduction, maybe because the author makes more. The author argues that they have student debt and went to school, while the roommate doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to think about fairness in splitting rent. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or agreed upon splits. If the author is already paying more because they earn more, maybe that's a pre-existing arrangement. Now, when the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the situation changes. The author is asking to adjust the split so they pay less than 50%, like 40%, but the roommate is upset.\n\nIs the author justified in asking for a reduction? Maybe they feel that since there are more people in the house, their share should decrease. But if the roommate's income is less, maybe the original split was based on income. However, the author is suggesting a new split based on the number of people, not income. That could be a point of contention. \n\nThe roommate might feel that the initial agreement was based on income and that adding a roommate shouldn't change that unless agreed upon. The author's reasoning about student debt and higher education might be a personal justification but not necessarily a valid argument for changing the split. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was income-based and the author is now trying to renegotiate based on the number of people, that could be seen as reasonable if the roommate's income is lower. However, the roommate might not agree. Alternatively, if the initial split was 50-50 but adjusted because the author made more, then the new situation might require a new agreement. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is being fair. If the author is asking for a lower percentage because there are more people, but the roommate's income is lower, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if the original split was based on income and the author is now trying to change it without mutual agreement, that could be problematic. \n\nI think the author has a valid point in wanting to adjust the split because the living situation is changing. However, the roommate's reaction might stem from feeling that the initial arrangement was fair. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the original agreement and whether renegotiation is reasonable. Since the author is trying to adjust based on the new circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the original split was based on income and the author is now ignoring that, they might be. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The author's points about income and existing debt might be their personal justification, but the main issue is the fairness of splitting the rent when more people are added. If the roommate's income is lower, maybe the author is justified in seeking a lower percentage. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
