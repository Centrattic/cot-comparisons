      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's roommate is going to have his girlfriend move in. The author already pays more than 50% of the rent because they earn more than the roommate. The roommate doesn't want a rent reduction even when the girlfriend moves in, and the author is suggesting a 40-60 split now. The roommate is upset. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. When someone else moves into the shared living space, it usually means the cost should be divided among more people. Typically, that would mean the rent per person decreases. The original split was based on two people. If a third person (the girlfriend) moves in, the author argues that the rent should be adjusted so they pay 40% and the roommate plus girlfriend pay 60%. The roommate is resistant because the author makes more money and already pays more than 50% now.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n\n1. The author currently pays over 50% of the rent.\n2. They want to adjust the split to 40% when the girlfriend moves in, implying the total number of people increases from two to three.\n3. The roommate is upset about this request.\n\nNow, the roommate's reasoning is that since the author makes more money and already pays more, there's no need to reduce their share when another person joins. The author's counter is that it's unfair because they have student debt and the roommate doesn't, and they went through school for a better job.\n\nLet me think about standard roommate agreements. Usually, when someone moves in, the rent is split among all roommates. If there are three people, the rent is divided by three. However, if the author is currently paying more than 50%, that might mean they have a different arrangement based on income. For example, maybe they split the rent based on income, but now with the third person, the dynamic changes.\n\nThe author is suggesting a 40-60 split. If the roommate and his girlfriend pay 60%, that would mean each of them pays 30% of the total rent? Wait, no\u2014if the split is 60% for the roommate and girlfriend combined, then each of them might pay 30%, but that depends on their agreement. Alternatively, the author wants to pay 40%, and the roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%, which could be split between them. However, the original arrangement was between two people. Now with three, it's more complicated.\n\nThe problem is that the roommate is not willing to reduce the author's share even though there's another person. The author's argument is that the rent should be split more evenly because there's another person, but the roommate is resistant because the author has a higher income. Is the author in the wrong here?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the roommate and his girlfriend are moving in, the total number of people increases, so the author's share should decrease. However, the roommate might argue that since the author has a higher income, they can afford to keep paying more. The author's counter is that they have student debt and the roommate doesn't, which complicates things.\n\nIn roommate agreements, it's common to split the rent equally among all roommates unless there's a specific agreement to the contrary. The author is now proposing a new arrangement because of the third person, which is reasonable. But the roommate is upset because they don't want to adjust the split. The author's reasoning seems logical: if another person is joining, the cost should be shared more among more people. The roommate's resistance might be because they don't want to adjust the split despite the income disparity, but that could be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate might have already considered that the author is paying more because of their income. If the original split was based on income (since the author makes more), maybe the roommate is okay with that. Now, with the third person, the author is suggesting a different split. The roommate might feel that the original arrangement was fair based on income and that adding a third person doesn't necessitate a change in their income-based split.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the original agreement. If the original arrangement was an income-based split between two people, then adding a third person might require re-evaluating the split. However, the author is now suggesting a per-person split (40-60, implying three people) which the roommate is not happy with. The roommate might not want to change the income-based split. The author's argument is that the presence of the third person should reduce their share, but the roommate is saying no because of the income difference.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because when more people move in, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. The roommate's refusal to adjust despite the third person moving in seems unfair. The author is trying to adjust the split to account for the increased number of people, which is a reasonable approach. The roommate's resistance based on income might not be justified if the new split is about the number of people. However, if the original agreement was strictly based on income, then maybe the author is overstepping. But since the original split was more than 50% because of income, the author's request is to adjust to a per-person split when the number increases. That seems fair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
