      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is suggesting no rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues they already pay more than 50% and have student debt, while their roommate doesn't. They proposed a 40-60 split, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nFirst, the roommate moving in a partner usually affects the living situation. Typically, when a roommate's partner moves in, it might be expected that the rent is adjusted, perhaps split between the two to cover the third person's share. The author is already paying more due to higher income, which they mention is because they have student debt and a better job. They feel it's unfair to maintain the same higher percentage when there's more people.\n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, they shouldn't get a reduction. But the author is asking for a more balanced split, even reducing their own share to 40%. The roommate's anger might stem from feeling that the author is taking advantage of their higher income or that the initial agreement was based on income disparity. However, when a new person moves in, the standard practice is to adjust the rent. If the total rent stays the same, each person's share might be adjusted based on the number of people. Alternatively, if the roommate's partner is moving in, perhaps the total rent is being split among three people, which complicates things. But the original scenario mentions splitting between two people, so maybe the total rent isn't changing, but now the roommate and his partner will be sharing expenses. \n\nSo, the author's request for a more equal split is reasonable. The roommate might not want to adjust because they feel the author's higher income should still make them pay more. However, fairness could be subjective here. The author is trying to make the split more equitable when there's an additional person, even though the roommate's partner isn't paying rent. If the roommate and his partner are sharing the same space, maybe the author is effectively subsidizing the roommate's partner's stay, which isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting the rent equally when there's an additional person might make sense, especially if the roommate isn't paying their share alone anymore. The author's argument about their own financial situation (student debt) is a valid point, but the roommate's debt (or lack thereof) doesn't negate the author's situation. The key issue is whether the rent split should be adjusted when the roommate's partner moves in, regardless of income. \n\nThe roommate's implication that the author shouldn't get a reduction because they make more is a bit of a red herring. If the roommate's partner is moving in, the rent should be split among all three, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, the roommate and partner might be sharing the same room or space, so the two roommates (original and author) would split the rent. But the original setup was two people splitting the rent, so adding a third person might require a new agreement. \n\nThe author's request for a 40-60 split is actually a reduction for themselves, which is a concession. The roommate's anger could be due to not wanting to pay more than they currently are, even if the justification is about the new person. The author isn't asking for a reduction in total rent, just a more balanced split. If the roommate is resistant, maybe they're being unfair by not adjusting the split to account for the new living arrangement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a fairer split when the roommate's partner moves in. The roommate's argument about income disparity doesn't address the change in the living situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
