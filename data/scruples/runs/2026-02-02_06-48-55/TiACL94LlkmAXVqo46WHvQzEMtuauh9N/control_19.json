I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is splitting the rent based on income, with the author paying more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate doesn't want a rent reduction, arguing that the author makes more money. The author feels it's unfair and suggests a 40-60 split, which upsets the roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms around roommates and rent splitting. Typically, when a new person moves in, the rent is divided among all occupants. However, in this case, the roommate and his girlfriend are two people, so maybe the original two-roommate setup is changing. The author is suggesting that the rent should be split three ways? Or is the author staying as one person in a three-person household?\n\nWait, the original setup was two roommates. Now, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, making it three people. The author is likely staying as one person, while the roommate and his girlfriend are two. So the total rent would now be split between three people. However, the author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which is 40% for the author and 60% for the roommate and his girlfriend combined. That would mean the author's share decreases, but the roommate and his girlfriend would split their 60%. So, the author is asking to pay less when there are more people, which is a common practice. However, the roommate is upset because the author has a higher income.\n\nBut the author already pays more than 50% because of higher income. The original split was income-based. Now, with a third person, the author is suggesting a different split. The roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, they shouldn't get a reduction. But in a three-person household, it's typical for each person to pay an equal share, regardless of income. However, some roommates do split based on income. The question is, is the author justified in wanting a lower share now that there's a third person?\n\nThe roommate's girlfriend moving in is a new person, so the rent should be adjusted. If the original split was 50-50 with two people, and now three people, each would pay a third. But the original split was more than 50% for the author. If the author is paying more than 50% now, maybe they want to adjust to a third each. But the author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which is less than the author's current 50%+ contribution. The roommate is upset because the author is higher income, but in a three-person split, the author's share should naturally decrease. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was based on income, and the new situation is three people, the author could argue that the split should be adjusted. However, the roommate might think that the income-based split should stay, even with three people. But typically, when a new person moves in, the rent is split equally among all occupants. So if the author is now one of three, their share should be a third. The roommate's girlfriend is also a tenant, so the author's share would decrease. The author is probably right to expect a lower share. The roommate is being unreasonable by not adjusting. The author isn't wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
