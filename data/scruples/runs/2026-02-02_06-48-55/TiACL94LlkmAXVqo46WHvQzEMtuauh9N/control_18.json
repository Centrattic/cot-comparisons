I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in.\n\nThe roommate's current arrangement is an unequal split because they make more money. Now, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate is saying there won't be a rent reduction even though the original split was unequal. The main points the author brings up are already paying more than 50%, their educational investment leading to higher income, and suggesting a new split (40-60) which the roommate is upset about.\n\nFirst, fairness in roommate splits often depends on factors like income, living conditions, and contributions. The original split was based on income, so when the roommate's partner moves in, the household dynamics change. The author is arguing that since the roommate's income is lower, the rent split should adjust accordingly. However, the roommate is resisting, possibly because the partner's presence might affect other factors like space or responsibilities.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The roommate is the one who previously agreed to an unequal split based on income. Now, when circumstances change (adding a partner), the author wants to adjust the split again. The roommate's stance might be that the initial arrangement was fair, and adding a partner doesn't necessarily mean the split has to change. However, the author is pointing out that they have higher expenses (student debt) and the roommate's partner moving in could affect shared resources.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommate's partner is moving in and the three of them are sharing the space, the rent split should logically account for all three people. But traditionally, when a couple moves in together, they might take on more space or responsibilities. However, the original arrangement was already unequal. The author is trying to adjust it based on income, which is a valid consideration. The roommate being upset might be because they don't want to adjust the split, even though their income is lower now.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the initial agreement was based on income and if the author is justified in adjusting it when circumstances change. Since the author is in a better financial position, they might have a valid point in wanting to adjust the split to reflect current contributions, especially considering their educational debts. The roommate's resistance could be seen as not acknowledging the change in circumstances. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
