I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate whose partner is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction because they pay more due to higher income. The roommate is suggesting no reduction because the author earns more, but the author thinks they should split the rent more evenly once the partner moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the current split. The author pays more than 50% because their income is higher. That seems fair initially, as splitting based on income is common. Now, when the roommate's partner moves in, the situation changes. The author suggests 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset. The author's reasoning is that the partner's move-in should affect the split, but the roommate might not agree because the author's higher income is a factor.\n\nThe key points are: 1. The current split is based on income. 2. The partner moving in might mean an additional person, but if the rent doesn't change, the split should adjust. However, if the total rent stays the same, maybe the author's argument is about fairness in contribution. The roommate might feel that since the author earns more, they should still contribute more even with the partner. The author might be right in wanting a more equal split if the roommate's financial situation is improving with the partner's help. Alternatively, the roommate might feel the original split based on income should remain, regardless of the partner. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was based on income, changing it when the roommate's financial situation changes (partner moving in) might be reasonable. But if the rent doesn't decrease, adjusting the split could be fair. The author's points about their own debt and education are maybe secondary. The main issue is whether the split should adjust based on the new household structure. If the partner is moving in, maybe the roommate and partner can cover their share together, so the author expects a lower percentage. The roommate might feel that the author's higher income justifies a higher share regardless. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid point about fairness when the roommate's situation changes. But if the rent remains the same, maybe the original split was based on income and should stay unless there's a change in total rent. However, since the roommate's partner is moving in, perhaps the roommate's ability to pay increases, so adjusting the split makes sense. The author's suggestion of 40-60 is a reasonable adjustment if the roommate's combined income allows that. The roommate's anger might stem from not wanting to reduce the author's contribution despite their higher income. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author is requesting a lower percentage without considering that their higher income is already a factor. If the roommate's partner moves in, the total income of the roommate's household might increase, which could allow for a different split. However, the author's argument is that they already pay more, so if the roommate's situation improves, the split should even out. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are adjusting based on the new circumstances. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
