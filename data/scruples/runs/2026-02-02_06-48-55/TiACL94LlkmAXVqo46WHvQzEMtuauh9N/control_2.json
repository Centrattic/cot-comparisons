I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is arguing that since the user earns more, there shouldn't be a rent reduction. The user currently pays more than half because of their higher income.\n\nFirst, fairness in split. When roommates split rent, it's common to base it on income if they can't agree on equal splits. The user has a higher income and already pays more than 50%, so if the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the user is now sharing the space with three people. That might mean the user's share should decrease to reflect the increased number of people in the household.\n\nThe user suggests 40% for themselves and 60% for the roommate and his girlfriend. The roommate is upset because he might think the user should still pay more due to higher income. But the user's argument is that with three people, the split should be more balanced. \n\nStudent debt and education are factors the user mentions. They might be justifying their higher income by pointing out their educational investment. However, the roommate's financial situation isn't discussed, so it's unclear if he's in a position where he can't handle a 60% share. \n\nKey points: The user is asking for a fairer split when the household size increases. The roommate is resisting because of income disparity. The user's reasoning is about the number of people versus income. Legally, there's no set rule on roommates' rent splits unless specified in a lease, so it's more about mutual agreement. \n\nThe user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're adjusting the split based on the new household structure. However, the roommate's argument about income could be seen as valid if they believe higher earners should contribute more. But when adding another person, it's reasonable to adjust the split. \n\nSo, the user's request is about fairness in light of changing circumstances. The roommate's refusal might be due to income-based reasoning, but the user's adjustment is about the number of people. It's a common conflict. The user's reasoning is valid, so they aren't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
