I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author is paying more than 50% because they make more money. The roommate is implying that the rent shouldn't be reduced when the girlfriend moves in because the author makes more. The author suggests splitting the rent 40-60, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical roommate arrangements. Usually, when a new person moves in, the rent is divided among all roommates. If the original roommate's partner is moving in, that's three people sharing the space, so maybe the rent should be split three ways. However, the author is arguing that since they pay more upfront because of their higher income, they want a lower percentage now. \n\nThe roommate might be upset because the author is changing the agreement after the fact. The initial arrangement was based on income disparity, but the author is now suggesting a new split when the roommate's partner joins. The roommate might feel that since the author is making more, they should still contribute more even with the new person. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes their student debt and higher education, which might not be directly relevant to the rent split. Rent is typically based on usage of space, not income or education. The roommate's argument is about fair splitting based on income, but the author wants to adjust the split when another person moves in. \n\nIs it fair to expect the rent to be split equally when the number of roommates increases? If the original split was unequal due to income, but now there are three people, maybe the rent should be divided three ways. The author is asking for a 40-60 split, which might not account for the new roommate. Maybe the author's request is to pay less than their current 50+%, but the roommate is already contributing more because of their income. \n\nThe roommate being mad makes sense if the author is changing the terms without considering the new roommate. The author might not have considered that the girlfriend, as a new roommate, would also have a say in the arrangement. The original agreement between two roommates doesn't extend to a third person without consent. \n\nSo, the author's request could be seen as unfair because they are adjusting the split without considering the new roommate's input. Roommate agreements should be mutual, and adding a third person complicates that. The author is in the wrong because they are trying to change the terms unilaterally and not accounting for the new roommate's presence. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
