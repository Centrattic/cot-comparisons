      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is suggesting no rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author currently pays more than 50% and wants to adjust it to 40%, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split costs based on income, but if a new person moves in, that might change. If the roommate's partner is moving in and will be sharing the space, maybe the rent should be split among more people. However, the author is already paying more because they earn more. The roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, the rent shouldn't be reduced. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they went to school, have student debt, and want to adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is mad, so maybe they expected the author to continue paying the same amount. Is the author entitled to a lower share if the roommate's partner is moving in? If the roommate's share will be split between him and his girlfriend, perhaps the author is right in adjusting their portion since the total number of people in the apartment is increasing. \n\nAnother angle: Roommate agreements often need to be renegotiated when new people join. The author is trying to set a fair arrangement, considering their financial situation. However, if the roommate's partner isn't contributing to the rent, the author's request might be seen as unfair because the roommate is still the one responsible for the rent, and the girlfriend isn't part of the agreement. \n\nWait, the original question is about a rent reduction when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. The author already pays more than 50% because they earn more. But if the roommate's partner is moving in, maybe the author expects the rent to be split among three people instead of two. However, if the roommate is still the one paying their share and the girlfriend is a free rider, the author's argument is that they are subsidizing the roommate's partner. The roommate might not want to reduce their own share because they still need to cover their part for two people (themselves and their girlfriend), hence the 50-50 split. \n\nBut the author is saying that since they pay more, they don't want to end up paying less than 50% when the roommate's share is now for two. The author is adjusting the split based on the new arrangement. The roommate is upset because they expect the original arrangement to stay the same. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? If the roommate's partner is moving in and not contributing to the rent, then the roommate is effectively getting a roommate for free. The author is trying to adjust the split to account for that. But in some cases, roommates don't adjust the split when a partner moves in unless the partner is also contributing. The author might be in the right if the roommate is using the author's higher income to offset the new person. However, the author should have discussed this before the girlfriend moves in. \n\nAlso, the roommate's argument is that the author makes more money, so maybe they should still pay more. But the author is asking to reduce their share to 40% if the roommate's share is now 60% (with the girlfriend), which would mean the roommate is paying less per person. If the roommate has a partner, maybe the split should be based on the number of people, but the author is not okay with that. \n\nIn typical roommate setups, if the roommate's partner moves in and is part of the household, the rent is often split as three people. However, if the author is already paying more than 50%, perhaps they would need to adjust their share downward to a 40% as the author suggests. The roommate might be mad because they were expecting to pay the same amount as before, and the author is changing the terms. \n\nBut maybe the author is right in wanting to adjust the split to account for the new person. The roommate should have considered this before inviting their partner to move in. The key point is whether the roommate's partner will be contributing to the rent. If not, the author's current payment effectively supports three people, which might not be fair. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid point about adjusting the split when the roommate's household increases. The roommate should have discussed this change in responsibilities beforehand. The author's request is about fairness based on the new living arrangement.\n"
