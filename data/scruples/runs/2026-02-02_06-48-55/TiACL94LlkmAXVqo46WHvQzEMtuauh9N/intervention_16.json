      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is suggesting that there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the original poster makes more money. The original poster already pays more than 50% due to their higher income and wants to adjust the split to 40-60 when the girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or other agreements. The original poster already pays more because they earn more, which seems fair. Now, with the addition of the roommate's girlfriend, there's a new person moving in. The original poster might be suggesting that since there are now more people, the rent should be split differently. But the roommate is pushing back because the original poster earns more. \n\nThe key points are: the original split is based on income, the new situation involves another person moving in, and the original poster wants to adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset because the original poster still makes more. \n\nIs it fair for the original poster to want a different split when more people are living there? If three people are now living in the apartment, the original split would change. If the original poster was paying more than 50% before, adding another person might mean that each person's share should be adjusted. However, the original poster is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the original poster is paying less than before. \n\nThe roommate might argue that since the original poster makes more, their share should still be higher, even with three people. The original poster might think that since there are more people, splitting equally would be fair. But the roommate's argument could be that the original poster's higher income justifies their share. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the roommate's girlfriend moving in. The original poster is concerned about contributing to another person's living expenses without any prior agreement. The roommate might have agreed to the original split with the understanding that it was just the two of them. Adding someone else could change the dynamic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for roommates to adjust the rent split when the living situation changes. However, the original poster's reasoning is based on the roommate's girlfriend moving in, which introduces a third person. If the original poster is now sharing the apartment with two people, splitting the rent three ways equally might be expected. However, the original poster is suggesting a 40-60 split, which might not account for the third person. \n\nAlternatively, if the roommate's girlfriend is considered part of his household, maybe they should combine their income for calculating the split. The original poster's argument that they have student debt and the roommate doesn't could be a factor, but it's not directly related to the income-based split. \n\nThe main issue is whether adjusting the rent split when another person moves in is fair. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that's an additional person contributing to the household, so splitting the rent three ways might be logical. However, the original poster is suggesting a 40-60 split, which might mean the original poster is paying less than their share if the new person isn't contributing. \n\nThe roommate is upset because the original poster is still making more money. It's possible that the roommate expects the original poster to maintain a higher share even with the addition. The original poster wants to reduce their share because there are more people. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in without contributing to the rent, the original poster might be right to adjust the split. However, if the roommate and his girlfriend will be paying their share together, then splitting the rent among three people would make sense. \n\nThe original poster's request to pay 40% might not account for the third person's contribution. If the roommate and his girlfriend are combining their income, the split should be based on all three incomes. If the roommate's girlfriend isn't contributing, then splitting the rent three ways equally might be fairer. \n\nIn conclusion, the original poster is suggesting a split that doesn't account for the third person's presence, which could be seen as unfair to the roommate. The roommate is justified in being upset if the original poster is reducing their share without considering the new household structure. Therefore, the original poster might be in the wrong for not addressing the third person's contribution and instead focusing on their own higher income.\n"
