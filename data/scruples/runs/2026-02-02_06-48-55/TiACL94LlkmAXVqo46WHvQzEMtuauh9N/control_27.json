      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The person wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The main points are about how the rent is split now versus when the girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, the roommate currently pays less because they split the rent based on income. The author pays more than 50% because they earn more. Now, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate doesn't want the rent to be reduced even though there are two more people in the house. The author thinks that since there are more people, the rent should be split 40-60 (author 40%, roommate and girlfriend 60%). The roommate is upset about this suggestion.\n\nSo, the key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Current Rent Split:** The rent is split based on income. The author pays more because they earn more, which might be a way to share the financial burden fairly. However, when the girlfriend moves in, there are now three people instead of two. The rent might not change if the total rent is the same, but the number of people increases. So, the author is suggesting that the split should adjust because there are more people. But if the total rent doesn't decrease, adjusting the split could mean the author pays less, but the total rent remains the same. Wait, maybe the total rent would stay the same, but the split would change to account for three people? Or is the presence of the girlfriend causing the total rent to decrease? That part isn't clear. The user says the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, but maybe the landlord would adjust the rent if there's a new roommate. But the post doesn't mention the landlord reducing the total rent. So perhaps the author is assuming that the total rent will decrease, but maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe the author wants to adjust the split so that the two existing roommates don't have to pay as much because there's an additional person contributing.\n\n2. **Fairness Based on Income:** The author argues that their higher income is why they pay more now. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, maybe the author wants the rent split based on the number of people instead of income. The roommate is resisting because the author's higher income should mean they contribute more, but the author thinks that the presence of another person should change the split. There's a conflict between splitting by income versus splitting by the number of people.\n\n3. **Moral Considerations:** The author feels they deserve a reduction because there's an additional person in the household. The roommate is upset because the author is still earning more. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting a shift from income-based to number-based splitting when the household size increases.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n- **Rent Splitting Norms:** In some cases, roommates split rent equally regardless of income, while others adjust based on income or other factors. If the current arrangement is based on income, changing to a different method when circumstances change (like adding another roommate) could be fair. However, if the total rent doesn't decrease, reducing the author's share might mean others pay more, which could be unfair.\n\n- **Expectations and Agreements:** If the original agreement was income-based, changing it without consensus could be problematic. But if the situation is changing (adding a new roommate), renegotiating terms is reasonable. The author is trying to adjust the split, which is a common practice when circumstances change.\n\n- **Emotional Factors:** The author mentions their student debt and the roommate's lack of debt. This might influence their perspective on fairness, but it's not a direct financial factor. It's more about long-term financial stability.\n\nIf the total rent remains the same and the author is moving from paying more than 50% (based on income) to paying 40% (based on number of people), that would mean their share decreases, which is their goal. However, if the roommate and his girlfriend are now three people, splitting based on number would be different. Let's do a hypothetical calculation. Suppose the total rent is $3000. Originally, two people. If the author pays more than 50% (say 60%), they pay $1800 and the roommate pays $1200. Now, with three people, splitting equally would be $1000 each. The author wants to pay 40%, so $1200 total. That would mean the roommate and his girlfriend split the remaining $1800, which is $900 each. But the original roommate's income might be lower, so maybe they can't afford to pay $900 if their income is low. The author's argument is that the split should adjust to the number of people, but the roommate is upset because he's still earning less and doesn't want his share to increase. The author might be in the right for wanting to adjust the split when the number of roommates increases, but the roommate is also within his rights to ask for the same contribution based on income. It's a matter of differing views on fairness.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole: The author is trying to adjust the rent split based on new circumstances, which is reasonable. The roommate is resistant because of income disparities. The author's reasoning is based on the number of people, which is a valid approach. However, if the original agreement was based on income, changing it might require negotiation. But since the situation has changed (new roommate), renegotiating terms is normal. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking a fair split under the new circumstances. The roommate's anger might stem from not wanting to adjust, but the author's request is reasonable. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
