I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether they're justified in wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so there's a third person. The original split was unequal because one roommate earns more. The poster argues that since the roommate's income is lower, they pay a larger share. Now, with the girlfriend joining them, the poster wants the rent split differently. They suggested 40-60, but the roommate is upset.\n\nSo, the main points here: fairness of rent split based on income, the presence of a third person, and whether the existing arrangement changes. The original arrangement was based on income disparity. When a third person moves in, the living situation changes. Typically, if someone else is moving in and contributing to the rent, the original split might need adjustment. \n\nBut the roommate isn't offering a reduction; the poster is suggesting it. The problem is that the roommate might feel that the original split was agreed upon based on their individual circumstances. The poster argues that since they pay more already, adding someone else should adjust the split. However, the roommate might feel that their existing arrangement should stay the same, especially if the new person is their partner and perhaps not initially contributing to rent.\n\nBut here's the thing: when a third person moves in, the usual approach is to have all three split the rent. However, if the original split was based on income, adding someone else might complicate it. The poster is suggesting a 40-60 split between themselves and the roommate, implying the roommate and his girlfriend together would pay 60%. That might not account for the girlfriend's presence. If the roommate's girlfriend is also contributing, then maybe the split should be adjusted differently. But if she's not paying rent yet, then the roommate might still be handling all of it, which could make the poster's request valid.\n\nAlso, the poster's reasoning includes their own student debt and the roommate's lack of it. That's about personal financial situations, which is a common argument in roommate splits. However, rent agreements are typically based on mutual agreement. If the roommate isn't willing to adjust, the poster's push for a change could be seen as reasonable if they're shouldering a disproportionate share.\n\nBut is the poster in the wrong? They're not necessarily at fault. The roommate's refusal to adjust might be the issue here. The problem arises from the initial terms not accounting for future changes. Roommate agreements can be fluid, and when circumstances change, renegotiation is expected. The poster is trying to adjust the split when a new person is added, which is a valid concern. The roommate's implication that no reduction is needed despite the new person might be unfair, especially if the original split was based on income disparity.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the poster is wrong. The roommate's girlfriend moving in changes the situation, and the poster is seeking a fairer split. The roommate's anger might stem from feeling that the original agreement is being challenged without mutual consent. But the poster has valid points about their financial burden and the new arrangement. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
