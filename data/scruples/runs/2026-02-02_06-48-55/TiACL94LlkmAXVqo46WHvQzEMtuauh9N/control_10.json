      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the author wanting a rent reduction. Let me break down the points.\n\nFirst, the roommates split the rent. The author says they already pay more than 50% because they make more money. The roommate is implying that even if his girlfriend moves in, there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more. The author is upset about that. Their arguments are that they already pay more and they have student debt from going to school, while the roommate doesn't. The author suggested paying 40% and the roommate 60%, but the roommate is mad. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nHmm. Let's think. Typically, when someone moves in with a partner, the rent might be split based on the number of people. But in this case, the original split was unequal because of income differences. Now, if another person moves in, maybe the rent should be adjusted. But the roommate is saying no reduction because the author makes more. The author feels that since they already pay more than half, they should get a lower share now that there are three people. \n\nWait, but if the rent is split equally, with three people, it would be 33% each. However, the original split was based on income. So if the rent remains the same but now there are three people, maybe the author's share should decrease because there are more people sharing the space. But the roommate is not willing to adjust the split. The author is suggesting 40-60, but the roommate is upset. \n\nIs it fair? Well, when someone moves in, typically the rent is divided by the number of rooms or people. But in this case, the original split was unequal. So maybe the author is trying to adjust the split to account for the new roommate. However, the roommate is arguing that since the author makes more, the split shouldn't change. The author's reasoning is that they already pay more than 50% and have student debt, so they can't afford to pay a higher percentage. \n\nI think that the author is not in the wrong here. They are trying to adjust the split to be fairer given the new circumstances. The roommate is being inflexible. The fact that the author went to school and has debt is a valid consideration in their financial situation. The roommate's girlfriend moving in is a change in the living arrangement, so the rent split should be renegotiated. The author's request for a 40-60 split (assuming the original was 50-50 plus more from the author) might be reasonable. The roommate is mad because they don't want to adjust, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
