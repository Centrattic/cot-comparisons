Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent leaving their 8-year-old kid at school during a book fair after a parent-teacher conference. The kid got a less-than-stellar report because he was acting out, and the parents refused to let him buy a book. The father stayed in the car in the parking lot, waiting for the kid to come out, but the kid came out crying, thinking he was left behind. The wife is upset because she thought the father would go back to get him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The key points here are the age of the child, the context of the parent-teacher conference, the refusal to buy the book, and the decision to wait in the car instead of retrieving the child. \n\nAn 8-year-old might not be able to handle being left alone, even if the parent is nearby. The father's intention was to scare the child into coming out quickly, but this could be seen as manipulative or cruel. The child ended up panicking and crying, which is a negative outcome. The parent's justification might be that he wanted to teach the child a lesson about misbehavior, but using fear tactics on a young child could be considered inappropriate.\n\nThe wife's anger is understandable because she expected the father to ensure the child's safety. The father didn't communicate his plan to her, leading to a misunderstanding. Leaving the child alone in a public place for 20 minutes might not be illegal, but it's questionable in terms of child welfare and emotional impact. The father's action could be seen as neglectful or emotionally harmful, especially without the child's knowledge. \n\nConsidering societal norms and parenting standards, intentionally scaring a child into coming out quickly, especially after a stressful situation like a parent-teacher conference, isn't a good approach. The child's emotional well-being is paramount, and causing panic, even if the parent was nearby, is not acceptable. The father should have either gone back to retrieve the child or communicated with the wife to avoid confusion. The outcome shows that the child felt abandoned, which is a serious issue.\n\nSo, the father's actions led to the child's distress and a breakdown in communication between the parents. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong. The best answer is A.\n"
