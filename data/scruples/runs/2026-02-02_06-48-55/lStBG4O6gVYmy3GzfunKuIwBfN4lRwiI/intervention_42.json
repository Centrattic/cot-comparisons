Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe parent left their 8-year-old kid at school during a parent-teacher conference. The kid was already upset about something and then got a less-than-stellar report, though his grades are good. After the conference, the kid wanted to buy a book from the library book store, but the parent said no. The kid went in anyway, and the parent and spouse walked out to the car. The parent left the younger kids with the spouse and stayed in the car, waiting to scare the kid by making him think they left. The kid came out crying, thinking he was left behind. The spouse was angry because the parent didn't go back in to get him.\n\nFirst, the kid is 8 years old. That's a young child. Leaving an 8-year-old alone in a school, even if they're in the library or book fair, might not be safe. Schools can be big, and kids can get lost or into trouble. The parent's intention was to scare the kid as a lesson, but that seems harsh. The kid was already upset and then thought he was abandoned. That's traumatic for a child. The spouse was angry because the parent didn't go back in to get him, which suggests she thought the parent was being careless or cruel. \n\nThe parent's reasoning might be that they wanted to teach the child a lesson about obeying and not going off on their own. But using fear tactics like making the child think they're abandoned could have lasting effects. The parent didn't actually leave the child; they were waiting in the car. But from the kid's perspective, he thought he was left, which is the same as abandonment. Even if it was a setup, the emotional impact on the child is significant.\n\nAlso, the parent's action of staying in the car instead of going back in to retrieve the child could be seen as not taking responsibility for the child's safety. The spouse expected the parent to go back in, but they didn't. That might have been a miscommunication, but the parent's choice to stay put and wait for the kid to come out on his own was risky. \n\nIn terms of parenting strategies, scaring a child into compliance is generally discouraged. It can lead to anxiety or trust issues. The parent might have been trying to enforce discipline, but the method was extreme. The kid was already in a vulnerable state after the conference, and this incident could have made things worse.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions, while perhaps intending to teach a lesson, were inconsiderate of the child's emotional well-being and safety. The spouse's anger is justified because the parent didn't act as expected, leading to the child's distress. So, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
