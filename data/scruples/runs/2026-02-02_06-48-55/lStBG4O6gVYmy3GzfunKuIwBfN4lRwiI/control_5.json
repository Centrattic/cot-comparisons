      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) who left their 8-year-old kid at school during a parent-teacher conference is in the wrong. The situation involves the kid getting a less-than-stellar report despite good grades, acting out in class. After the conference, the kid wants to buy a book from the library book fair, but the parent says no. The kid goes in anyway, and the parent waits in the car, thinking the wife will pick up the other kids and that they'll come back for him later. The kid comes out crying, thinking he was left behind, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. An 8-year-old is quite young, and leaving them alone at school, even for 20 minutes, might be risky. The parent's intention was to \"scare\" the kid, but that seems harsh. The kid was already upset from the conference and then left alone, which could cause anxiety. The parent didn't have a clear plan to retrieve him immediately, relying on the wife to take the other kids home. The wife misunderstood and thought the parent was going back for him. The kid ended up in panic.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, being left alone in a public place without explanation can be traumatic. Even if the parent intended to come back later, the execution was poor. The parent didn't communicate properly with the wife, leading to confusion. Also, using the child's anxiety as a form of discipline (scare tactics) might not be appropriate. The parent's actions could be seen as neglectful, especially given the child's age and emotional state.\n\nHowever, the parent might argue that they were trying to teach a lesson, but that doesn't justify leaving a child in a stressful situation. The key points are the child's age, the lack of communication, and the resulting emotional distress. The parent's decision to wait in the car instead of retrieving the child immediately shows a lack of consideration for the child's safety and emotional well-being. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong.\n"
