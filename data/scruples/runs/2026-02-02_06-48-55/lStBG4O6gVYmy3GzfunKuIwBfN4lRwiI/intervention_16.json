Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent leaving their 8-year-old kid at school during a book fair after refusing to let him buy a book. The parent waited in the parking lot to scare him, leading the child to think he was left behind.\n\nFirst, the key points: The kid was upset about his report card, got huffy when told \"no\" about the book, went into the book fair, and the parents left, thinking they'd stay. The dad stayed in the car, visible to the school exit, waiting for the kid to come out. The kid comes out after 20 minutes, panicking, thinking he was abandoned. The wife is upset because the dad didn't go in to get him.\n\nNow, considering child welfare and parental responsibility. An 8-year-old should not be left unsupervised at school, even if the parent is nearby. The dad's plan was to scare the kid, but this could be seen as manipulative or neglectful. The child was left to panic, which could cause emotional distress. The parent's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's emotional state and safety. Even if the parent was in view, the child was alone and distressed. The wife's anger is justified because the dad didn't ensure the child's immediate safety and well-being. The parent's intention to scare the child might be a form of punishment without considering the child's feelings or the potential harm. So, the answer leans towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
