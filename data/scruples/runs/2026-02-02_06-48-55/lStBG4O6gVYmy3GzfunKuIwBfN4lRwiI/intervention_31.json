Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe parent left their 8-year-old kid at school during a parent-teacher conference. The kid was already upset about something before the conference and then got a less than stellar report, even though his grades are good. Afterward, the kid wanted to buy a book from the library book fair, but the parent said \"no.\" The kid went in anyway, and the parent decided to stay in the car, thinking the other parent would go back to get him. However, the parent stayed in the car waiting for the kid to come out, which took about 20 minutes. The kid came out crying, thinking they left him. The wife is upset because the parent didn't go in to get him, leading the kid to believe they abandoned him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parent decided to leave the child alone in the school to scare him. The kid was already in a vulnerable state after the conference and the refusal to buy a book. The parent's plan was to wait in the car to scare the child, but the child ended up panicking and thinking they were left behind. The parent didn't intervene or check on the child during the 20 minutes, even though they could see the exit.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, leaving an 8-year-old unattended in a school, even if it's just in a library area, might be risky. The parent's intention was to scare the child, which could be seen as emotional manipulation. The child's reaction\u2014crying and thinking they were abandoned\u2014indicates that the plan backfired and caused unnecessary distress.\n\nThe wife's anger is justified because the parent didn't follow through on the expectation of retrieving the child. The parent's actions led to the child feeling abandoned, which is a serious concern. Even if the parent thought they were teaching a lesson, the method was harmful and could have long-term effects on the child's trust and emotional well-being.\n\nLegally, leaving a child unattended in a public place might not be a criminal act, but ethically and morally, it's questionable. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's safety and emotional security. The parent's decision to not intervene when the child was in distress shows a lack of consideration for the child's emotional needs.\n\nPossible defenses the parent might have: Maybe they thought the child would learn a lesson about respecting their parents' decisions. However, the outcome was the opposite\u2014causing the child fear and anxiety. The parent's justification doesn't outweigh the child's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions were inconsiderate and potentially harmful. They should have prioritized the child's immediate emotional needs over any disciplinary intentions. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
