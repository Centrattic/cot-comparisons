Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent, who's the author here, left their 8-year-old kid at school during a library book fair after a parent-teacher conference. The kid wanted to buy a book, but the parent said no, and then they walked out to the car. The other kids were already in the car, and the wife thought the author was going back in to get the kid. But instead, the author stayed in the parking lot and waited for the kid to come out, which he did after 20 minutes, panicking and crying because he thought they left him.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks yes, but wants to know my take. Let's consider the key points. The child is 8 years old, which is pretty young. The parent made a decision to not go into the school, even though the child was upset. The parent's reasoning might be that they wanted to teach the child a lesson for not listening or for acting out in class as mentioned in the report. But the child ended up being left alone for 20 minutes, which could be traumatic. The other parent (wife) is upset because the kid thought they left him, which could have been a safety issue. Also, the parent didn't consider the child's age and emotional state. Even if the child was acting out, leaving him alone for that long without supervision could be considered neglectful. The parent's intention was to scare the child, which might be a form of punishment, but it's not appropriate for an 8-year-old. The child was in a public place, but the school might not have been the best place to leave him alone. The parent should have gone back in to ensure the child's safety and emotional well-being instead of waiting in the car. The wife's reaction makes sense because it seems like the parent didn't take responsibility for the child's immediate needs. So, the author likely made a poor decision, even if the intention was to teach a lesson. The child's safety and emotional health should come first. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
