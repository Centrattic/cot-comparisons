Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their 8-year-old kid in school after a parent-teacher conference and then waiting in the parking lot to scare them. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the kid was acting out in class, which led to a less than stellar report despite good grades. During the conference, the kid wanted to buy a book from the library store, but the parent said no. The kid went in anyway, and the parents left, thinking the father would get him. The father stayed in the car, waiting, and when the kid came out crying, thinking they left him, the wife was angry.\n\nSo, is the father wrong? Well, leaving an 8-year-old alone for 20 minutes might be a problem. Even though he was waiting in the car, the kid didn't know that. The kid was in a panic, which could be traumatic. The father's intention was to scare him, maybe as a lesson, but that seems harsh. The wife's anger is valid because she thought he was going back in. Also, leaving a child alone, even briefly, could be considered neglectful depending on the context. The kid was upset and thought he was abandoned. That's a stressful situation for a child. The father's action might have been meant as a teaching moment, but the method was harmful. So, probably the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
