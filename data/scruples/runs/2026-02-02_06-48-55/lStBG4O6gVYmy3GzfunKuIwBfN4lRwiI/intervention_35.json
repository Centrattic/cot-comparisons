Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person left their 8-year-old kid at school during a parent-teacher conference. The kid was already upset about the teacher's feedback and then got denied buying a book. He went into the library book fair by himself. The parents decided to leave, with the wife taking the younger kids home, assuming the husband would go back to get the older one. Instead, the husband stayed in the car and waited to scare the kid, leading the child to think they were left behind.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the child's age, the situation leading up to it, and the parents' actions. The kid is 8, which is pretty young. When a child is left alone, even temporarily, it can be extremely distressing. The parents had a plan where the wife thought the husband would retrieve him, but he didn't go in. Instead, he waited in the parking lot to surprise him, which caused the child to panic and cry, thinking he was abandoned.\n\nFrom a child safety perspective, leaving an 8-year-old unsupervised at a school might not be the safest thing, even if it's just for a short time. The father's intention was to scare the kid, but that's a form of emotional manipulation. The child was already in a vulnerable state after the conference and the denied book purchase. The father's actions could be seen as cruel because he took advantage of the child's anxiety to create a scare, which is not a healthy way to parent. The wife was upset because the husband didn't follow through on his part of the plan, leading to the child's distress. \n\nThe father's reasoning might be that he wanted to teach the kid a lesson or get a reaction, but using fear and abandonment is not appropriate. It's important to consider the child's emotional well-being and the trust between parent and child. By making the child think they were left, it could shake the child's trust in their parents. Even if the intention was just a prank, the method was harmful. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the father is in the wrong because he didn't act in the best interest of the child. He should have gone back to get him immediately instead of waiting to scare him. The wife's anger is justified because the father didn't follow through, and the child was unnecessarily frightened. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
