Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their 8-year-old son at school after a parent-teacher conference. The kid wanted to buy a book from the school library, but the parents said no. The father waited in the parking lot for 20 minutes, and when the kid came out, he was upset, thinking they left him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child\u20148 years old. At that age, children are typically not left alone without supervision, especially in a public place like a school. The parent's decision to stay in the car instead of retrieving the child could be seen as neglectful. Even if the parent was waiting in view, the child didn't know that, leading to panic and distress.\n\nThe parents had a prior agreement that the husband would go back in, but he didn't. The wife is upset because she thought he would. This shows a breakdown in communication between the parents. The father's intention might have been to teach the child a lesson, but the consequence was emotional harm to the child. \n\nLegally, leaving a minor unattended in public can have implications, though it's more about safety. Ethically, causing a child to feel abandoned is problematic. The child's well-being is the priority. The father's actions led to the child's fear and distress, which could have lasting effects. \n\nAlternatives could have been to calmly go back with the child or explain the decision. The father's method was a form of punishment without considering the emotional impact. So, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
