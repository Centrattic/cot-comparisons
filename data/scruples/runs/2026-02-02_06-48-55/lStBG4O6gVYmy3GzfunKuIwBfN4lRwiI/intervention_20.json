Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent left their 8-year-old kid alone in the school after a parent-teacher conference. The kid wanted to buy a book from the library bookstore, but the parent said no. The kid went in anyway, and the parent waited in the car to \"scare\" him, which ended up making the kid think they left him. The wife is upset because the parent didn't go back to get him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages involved. The kid is 8 years old, which is pretty young. Kids at that age can get easily overwhelmed or panicked, especially if they think their parents have abandoned them. The parent's intention was to scare the kid by waiting in the car, but the result was the kid panicking and crying, thinking he was left. That's a significant emotional consequence.\n\nThe parent's actions led to the child being left alone for 20 minutes. Even if the parent was in the parking lot visible, the kid wouldn't know that. From the kid's perspective, he goes into the bookstore, maybe gets distracted, and then comes out to find the car gone. That's terrifying. Leaving a child alone in an unfamiliar place, even if you're nearby, can be dangerous and emotionally traumatic.\n\nAlso, the parent's reasoning was to teach the kid a lesson for not listening. But using fear as a disciplinary method can backfire, especially with young children. The parent didn't consider that the child might not understand the situation and could have a meltdown. There's also the aspect of parental responsibility. The parent was supposed to supervise the child, but instead left them alone, which could be seen as neglectful.\n\nThe wife is angry because she thought the husband would go back to get the kid, which shows a lack of communication between the parents. The husband's decision to stay in the car instead of following up to ensure the kid's safety might have been a poor judgment call. Even if the intent was to teach a lesson, the method was harmful and unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's actions directly caused the child distress. While the intention wasn't malicious, the outcome was harmful. The parent didn't take into account the child's age and emotional state. So, the answer is likely that the parent is in the wrong (A).\n"
