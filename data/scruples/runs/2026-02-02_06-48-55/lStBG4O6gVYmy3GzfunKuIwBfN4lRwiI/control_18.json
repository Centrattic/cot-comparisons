Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person left their 8-year-old kid in the school after a parent-teacher conference where the kid got a less-than-stellar report. The kid was already upset because of the conference and had been acting out. When the kid wanted to buy a book from the library store, the parent refused, leading the kid to go into the store anyway. The parents then left, thinking the parent would go back to get the kid, but instead, the parent waited in the parking lot. The kid came out 20 minutes later, panicking and thinking they were left behind.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's actions caused the kid to be left alone and then to experience distress. Even if the parent was trying to teach a lesson or deal with the kid's behavior, the result was that the child felt abandoned. The parent didn't go back to retrieve the kid immediately, which could be seen as neglectful. Also, the kid was in a vulnerable state after the conference, which might make the situation more severe. The parent's decision to wait instead of going in might be considered irresponsible, especially since the kid was young and could become frightened. The wife was upset because she expected the parent to go back, indicating that maybe the parent didn't communicate properly. Overall, the parent's actions led to the child's emotional distress, which is a strong point towards being in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
