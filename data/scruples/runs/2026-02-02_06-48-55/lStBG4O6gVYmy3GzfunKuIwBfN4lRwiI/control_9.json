Has parent teacher conferences. Prior the the conferences he is freaking out about something (to my wife while I'm not there). During the conferences he gets a less than stellar report. He has good grades and all, but a lot of shouting/acting up in class. So after the conference he wants to buy a book from the library book store. My wife hesitates, and I drop a firm \"No\". He starts to get huffy and says hes going into the library book fair anyways, which he does.\n\nI tell my wife lets just keep walking. So we walk out to the car, I put the three younger kids in, and my wife takes them home. She thinks I am going back in to get him. I stay in my car, which is in direct view of the exit of the school. I wait for him to come out which happens in about 20 minutes.\n\nHe comes out in a panic, crying, thinking we left him.\n\nMy wife is angry that I did not go into the school to get him, and that I instead led him to believe that we left him at the school.\n\nI will update with any follow up/ or clarifying answers.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent left their 8-year-old at school during a library book fair after a parent-teacher conference. The kid went into the book fair, and the parent waited in the parking lot, not going in to get him. The child came out crying, thinking they were left. The wife is upset because the parent didn't go in to get the kid.\n\nFirst, the child is 8, which is pretty young. They might not have the independence to handle being left alone without knowing when their parents will come back. The parent didn't inform the child about the plan, which could lead to anxiety. Also, the parent didn't check in with the school or communicate with the wife about the plan, which might have caused confusion. The wife thought the parent was going back in, but they stayed in the car. The parent's intention was to scare the child, which isn't a good reason for leaving a young kid alone without clear communication. The child panicked, which shows the plan backfired. Even if the parent was trying to teach a lesson, the method was harmful and unsafe. So, the parent is in the wrong for not ensuring the child's safety and emotional well-being.\n"
