Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation involves the author finding out that their co-worker is a sex worker, specifically a domme, through a video they found online. The author then told another co-worker to keep it secret, but the secret got out, leading the domme co-worker to consider quitting. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, adult content is legal if the participants are of age and have consented. However, sharing someone's personal information without their consent can be problematic. The key here is whether the author had the right to share this information. Even if the content was publicly available, spreading it without the person's permission invades their privacy. \n\nThe author's actions led to the co-worker being outed, which caused her distress and potentially her job. The company might have policies about such matters, but even if not, the act of sharing private information can be seen as a breach of confidentiality. The author might argue that they didn't know the other person was a co-worker, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility once they found out. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author trusted someone else with the information and that person failed to keep it secret complicates things. The author is still the one who initiated the sharing, so they bear primary responsibility. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for discrimination or harassment. If the co-worker is considering quitting due to this exposure, it could be a hostile work environment issue. The author's actions might be seen as contributing to a toxic environment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the co-worker chose to be a sex worker and should expect some level of privacy. But the key point is that the author shared private information without consent, which is generally wrong regardless of the content. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared confidential information that led to their co-worker's distress and potential job loss, even if they didn't intend for the information to spread further.\n"
