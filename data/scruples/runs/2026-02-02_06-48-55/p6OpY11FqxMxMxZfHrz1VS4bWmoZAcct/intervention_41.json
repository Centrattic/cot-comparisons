Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a co-worker who is a sex worker, as revealed through a video the narrator found. The narrator told a friend, who then spread the information despite being asked to keep it secret. The domme co-worker is now considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is the spread of private information. The narrator found out their co-worker's personal activities and shared it with a friend, warning them not to tell anyone. However, the friend did spread it, leading to the co-worker's distress. \n\nThe question is whether the narrator is at fault. The act of exposing someone's private life, especially related to their personal choices or profession, can be considered a violation of privacy. Even if the narrator didn't directly spread it widely, they were the initial source. By telling a friend, they set off a chain of events that led to the information getting out. \n\nPrivacy laws and workplace ethics come into play here. In many places, sharing someone's personal information without consent, especially if it's related to their private life or profession, is a breach of confidentiality. The narrator's actions, even if done with good intentions (like being shocked or concerned), led to harm to a co-worker. \n\nThe domme's situation is also important. If she's a legal sex worker, it's her choice, and others shouldn't interfere. However, if the activities are illegal, that could change things, but the story doesn't specify. Assuming it's legal, the narrator's exposure of her personal life without consent is problematic. \n\nEven if the friend was the one who spread it, the narrator is still responsible for initiating the disclosure. They broke trust by sharing something personal, which then spiraled out of control. The narrator might argue they didn't know it was illegal or harmful, but intent doesn't absolve responsibility in privacy violations. \n\nWorkplace dynamics are also a factor. Spreading such information can create a hostile work environment, even if unintentionally. The domme now feels pressured to quit because of the exposure, which is a significant consequence. \n\nIn conclusion, the narrator's actions contributed to the spread of private information, leading to negative outcomes for the co-worker. Even if they didn't spread it themselves, they were the source. Therefore, they are at least partially responsible and in the wrong.\n"
