Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker who's a sex worker, and the author found a video of her and told another co-worker, who then spread it. Now the domme co-worker might quit because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered the video through their own means, maybe on a platform like Pornhub. They recognized their co-worker and decided to share it with another co-worker, who then spread it. The domme co-worker is now considering quitting. \n\nThe main ethical issues here are privacy and consent. The co-worker in question is a sex worker, which in many places is legal, but sharing such content without consent is a privacy violation. Even if the content is public (like on a phub), sharing it with others without permission is problematic. The author might argue that the content was public, so it's not their fault, but intentionally spreading it to colleagues could be seen as malicious or at least careless. \n\nAlso, the author tried to keep it secret but the other co-worker spread it. However, the initial act of telling the friend was the start. Even if the friend broke the confidentiality, the author is responsible for initiating the chain. \n\nAnother angle: Is the author in the wrong for exposing their co-worker's private life, regardless of legality? Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her personal choice, and the author's actions could have led to her losing her job or feeling humiliated. The office environment's reaction matters too\u2014workplace privacy and respect for personal lives are important. \n\nBut wait, if the video was on a public platform, does that change things? Some might say that if it's public, it's fair game. However, sharing it without consent still invades someone's privacy. The content might be legal, but the act of sharing it without permission is a breach of trust and respect. \n\nThe author's responsibility: They should have considered the consequences. Even if they thought they were keeping it secret, by telling someone, they set a precedent. The fact that the co-worker might quit shows the impact of their actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because they shared private information (even if publicly available) without consent, leading to a breach of privacy and potential harm to their co-worker. Answer A.\n"
