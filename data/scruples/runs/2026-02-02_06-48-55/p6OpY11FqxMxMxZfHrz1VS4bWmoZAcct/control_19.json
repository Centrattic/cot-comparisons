Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a co-worker who is a sex worker, and the author exposed her identity after finding an explicit video of her. \n\nFirst, the author found the video by accident while watching kinky content. They recognized the co-worker and discovered her domme name. Then, they told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did spread the information, leading to the office finding out. The co-worker is now considering quitting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't create the content but discovered it. They shared the information with a friend, who then couldn't keep it secret. The co-worker's privacy was violated, which is a big issue. Even though the author might not have posted the video themselves, they shared the information that led to the co-worker's exposure. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. Legally, sharing someone's identity as a sex worker without their consent can be problematic, especially if it leads to harassment or employment issues. Ethically, respecting privacy is important. The author might have thought they were just sharing a secret, but the consequence was harmful. \n\nEven if the author's intention wasn't to harm, the act of exposing someone's personal activities, especially in a workplace context, is generally considered wrong. The fact that the co-worker might quit shows the impact of the author's actions. The author should have kept the information private instead of sharing it with a friend, regardless of the friend's discretion. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for sharing the information, leading to the co-worker's distress and potential job loss.\n"
