Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a co-worker who's a sex worker, and the author found out through a video and then told a friend, who then spread it around the office.\n\nFirst, the author saw their co-worker's work online. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is a legal activity in many places, so the author isn't breaking any laws just by finding out. But the key issue here is privacy. The co-worker might have kept this private, and by sharing it, the author is violating her privacy. \n\nThe author told a friend explicitly not to spread it, but the friend did. However, the author is still partially responsible because they were the one who initially shared the information. Even if the friend broke the confidentiality, the author started the chain by not respecting the co-worker's privacy. \n\nWorkplace gossip can be a big deal. The co-worker is considering quitting because of this, which shows that the author's actions had real consequences. The author might argue that they didn't know the identity at first, but once they found out, they should have kept it to themselves. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment of the co-worker's occupation might be a factor. Even if the author disapproves, that doesn't give them the right to expose someone. The core issue is respecting another person's privacy, especially in a professional setting. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information about a co-worker, leading to negative consequences. The answer is A."
