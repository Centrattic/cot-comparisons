Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out a co-worker is a sex worker by recognizing her in some explicit content. The author told another co-worker not to spread the info, but the info did spread, leading the co-worker to consider quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The co-worker's privacy is a big factor. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, her clients and work might be private matters. The author discovered this information without consent and then shared it with someone else, despite knowing the potential consequences. Even if the author thought they were keeping it secret, the act of sharing it with one person who then spread it could make the author complicit in the breach of privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's intent matters. Did they have a good reason to share it? The post doesn't mention any harm beyond the potential spread of information. The co-worker might have wanted to keep her profession private, and the author's disclosure, even if unintentional, caused distress. The author might be responsible because they started the chain by telling someone, even if they asked that person to keep it secret. Trust is a two-way street, and the author should have considered the consequences of sharing such sensitive information, regardless of the other person's job.\n\nAnother angle: even if the co-worker is a sex worker, her work is her business. The author's actions could lead to harassment or a hostile work environment. The author's initial discovery through a video they were watching might be seen as a personal curiosity, but then sharing it was a breach of privacy. The fact that the office found out and the co-worker is quitting suggests serious consequences. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the co-worker's privacy, even if the information was found accidentally.\n\nPossible defenses: The author didn't know initially it was their co-worker, but once they realized, they had a responsibility to keep it private. Since they chose to share it with someone else, they contributed to the problem. The fact that the co-worker is in a start-up with young people might mean they're in an environment where such information could be more damaging. The author's actions, regardless of intent, led to harm. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
