Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for exposing their coworker who is a sex worker. The situation is that they found out a coworker is a domme (a dominant in BDSM) by watching a video they found online. Then they told another coworker, who couldn't keep it secret, and now the whole office knows. The domme coworker is considering quitting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. First, the author found out about their coworker's private work. Even if the content was publicly available on an adult site, sharing that information without consent is a privacy issue. Then, the author told another coworker, trusting them not to spread it, but the coworker did. The author feels bad now. \n\nLegally, in some places, sharing someone's identity as a sex worker without their consent could lead to issues like doxxing or invasion of privacy. Even if it's legal for adults to engage in consensual activities, the act of revealing someone's private life without their permission is problematic. \n\nEthically, respecting others' privacy is key. The coworker might have wanted to keep their profession separate from work. The author's actions led to her quitting, which is a significant consequence. Even if the coworker is in a legal profession, the author's breach of confidentiality caused harm. \n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know it was her at first, but once they did, they still chose to share it with someone else. So, they had the responsibility to keep it private. The fact that the coworker mentioned her domme name and it was identifiable makes it their secret to share. \n\nAlso, the coworker who spread it further is part of the problem, but the author started the chain. Even if they trusted someone, they shouldn't have shared it in the first place. The author's actions led to the domme's distress and possible job loss. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
