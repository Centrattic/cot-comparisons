Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person found out their co-worker is a sex worker and shared that information, leading to the co-worker potentially quitting. \n\nFirst, the author discovered their co-worker's involvement in adult content. Even if they found it accidentally, the next step is important. The author told another co-worker, who then spread the news. The author claims they told the friend to keep it a secret, but the friend didn't, so the office found out.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and consent. The co-worker is a sex worker, and while that's a legal activity in many places, it's a personal choice. The author had no right to share that information without the co-worker's consent. Even if the author didn't spread it themselves, they did tell someone else, which led to the information being leaked. \n\nEven if the author felt shocked, the right action would be to respect the co-worker's privacy. Sharing such sensitive information could lead to harassment, judgment, or a hostile work environment. The fact that the co-worker is considering quitting shows the negative impact of the leak.\n\nThe author's defense might be that they didn't spread it themselves, but they still initiated the chain by telling the friend. The friend's betrayal is a separate issue, but the author still bears some responsibility for starting the conversation. \n\nIn a workplace, respecting colleagues' privacy is crucial. Unless there's a valid reason (like harassment or illegal activities that affect others), sharing personal information is a breach of trust. The author's actions, even if accidental, contributed to the co-worker's distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
