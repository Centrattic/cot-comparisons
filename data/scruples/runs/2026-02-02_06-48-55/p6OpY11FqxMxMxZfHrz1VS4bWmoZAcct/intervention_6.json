Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out a co-worker is a sex worker from a video, told a friend to keep it secret, but the friend spilled the beans, leading to the whole office finding out. The co-worker is considering quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. The key points here are privacy, consent, and the consequences of sharing personal information. The co-worker's work as a sex worker is part of her private life. The author discovered this through a video where the co-worker might have kept her identity hidden. By sharing this, even if it was a friend who spread it, the author initiated the leak. Even though the friend was the one who spread it further, the author's initial disclosure was a breach of privacy. The author's actions contributed to the information getting out, so they share responsibility. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone else's private information without their consent, even if it's something like being a sex worker, is considered a violation of privacy. The fact that the author didn't keep their word to the friend to not tell anyone and still told them in the first place is problematic. So, the author's actions led to the spread, even if the friend was the main culprit. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
