Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author found out their coworker, who's a sex worker, was doing a domination performance online. They told another coworker, specifically asking not to spread it, but the secret got out, causing the domme coworker to consider quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author discovered private content of a coworker. Even if the coworker is a sex worker, sharing that information without consent is a big issue. The author's friend broke confidentiality, but the author started the chain by telling the friend. The fact that the author took the content to their friend, even if they begged secrecy, still initiates the privacy breach. \n\nConsent is a major factor. The domme coworker might have consensual activities but sharing her private work without her permission is a violation. Even if the content is public online, the context and how it's shared matters. It's one thing to be a sex worker and choose clients, but having colleagues know and spread it without consent can lead to harassment or a toxic work environment.\n\nAlso, the author's curiosity and judgment could be factors. They might be projecting their own kinks onto others, but that doesn't justify exposing someone else's private life. The work environment is important, and such exposure can lead to discrimination or a hostile workplace. \n\nThe author's friend spread the information despite being told not to, which is part of the problem. However, the initial act of the author sharing the information, even with an NDA, starts the problem. The author can't control others' actions, but by initiating the spread, they share responsibility. \n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is paramount. Unless there's a legitimate reason (like safety concerns), sharing someone's private information without consent is wrong. The author's justification for sharing might be that they found it surprising, but that's not a valid reason. The domme coworker's right to privacy and workplace dignity should be respected.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for exposing their coworker's private activities without consent, even if the friend was the one who spread it further. The act of initiating the disclosure is where the fault lies.\n"
