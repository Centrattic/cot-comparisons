Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author works at a startup and found out that a coworker, who is a sex worker, appears in some adult content. They saw a video of her performing a specific act and recognized her. Then, they told another coworker, who promised not to spread it, but ended up the whole office found out. The coworker who's a sex worker is now considering quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The author discovered something about a coworker's private life, which could be considered personal information. Even though the content was online, the author took it upon themselves to share it with others, despite the coworker's privacy. The fact that the coworker is a sex worker might be a sensitive topic, especially in a work environment.\n\nThe main issue here is the breach of privacy. Even if the content was publicly available, the author's decision to share it with others is a violation of the coworker's privacy. The coworker might have wanted to keep her work as a sex worker separate from her professional life. By sharing this information, the author caused distress and potentially led to her quitting. \n\nAdditionally, the author told a coworker not to tell anyone, but the story spread anyway. This shows that the author didn't trust their friend to keep the secret, and even if the friend was the one who spread it, the initial act of confiding in her was problematic. The author should have considered the potential consequences of sharing such sensitive information.\n\nAnother angle is the legality and workplace policies. In many places, sharing someone's private information without consent can lead to legal issues or disciplinary action in the workplace. The author's actions could be seen as malicious or discriminatory, especially if the coworker's profession is being stigmatized.\n\nIt's also important to consider the context of the workplace. Sharing personal details about a coworker, regardless of the content, is unprofessional and can create a hostile work environment. The fact that the author felt the need to involve others and not respect the coworker's privacy shows a lack of empathy and consideration.\n\nIn summary, the author used information they found online about a coworker's private activities and shared it with others, leading to negative consequences. Even if the content was public, the act of spreading it without consent is a clear breach of privacy and unprofessional behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
