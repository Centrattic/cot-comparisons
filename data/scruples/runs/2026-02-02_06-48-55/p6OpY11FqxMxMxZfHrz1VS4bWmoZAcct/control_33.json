Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing a co-worker who's a sex worker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out their co-worker is a sex worker, specifically a domme, by watching a video of her. Then they told another co-worker, who swore not to spread it, but the information ended up getting out, causing the domme co-worker to consider quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author discovered the co-worker's private work (sex work), shared it with someone else despite a secrecy request, and the secret was broken, leading to negative consequences.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations. Sharing someone else's private information without consent is generally wrong. Even if the author didn't know the co-worker was a sex worker beforehand, once they found out, they had a responsibility to keep it confidential if they had promised. The fact that the co-worker didn't want the secret spread and the author broke that promise, leading to the domme's potential quitting, points towards the author being at fault.\n\nAlso, the nature of the work\u2014sex work\u2014might be a sensitive topic. Even if the co-worker hasn't shared this publicly, others might have their own reasons for keeping it private. The author's decision to share it, regardless of intent, breaches trust and privacy. The fact that the author used the co-worker's real name or identifiable information from the video could be a privacy violation.\n\nAnother angle: the author might argue they had no malicious intent, but the consequences are still harmful. The co-worker is considering quitting, which is significant. The author's actions, even if not intended to harm, led to that outcome. The responsibility lies with the person who initiated the sharing, even if the second co-worker also broke the promise. The author started the chain by telling someone they shouldn't have.\n\nIn most ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy and confidentiality is key. Unless there's a legal requirement to report something, which isn't mentioned here, the author's actions were a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
