Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker as a sex worker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author discovered their co-worker is a domme (a dominant in BDSM contexts) through a video. Then they told another co-worker not to spread it, but the information leaked, leading the co-worker to consider quitting.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) The author found out about their co-worker's private work through a video. 2) They shared it with a friend, asking her not to spread it, but she did. 3) The co-worker is now considering quitting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the co-worker is a sex worker. The fact that someone is a sex worker is a personal choice, but in many places, it's legal. However, if the co-worker didn't disclose this at work, it's her private business. The author had a duty of confidentiality towards her, especially since they discovered it without her consent.\n\nThe author saw a personal video of her. Even if the video is publicly available online, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is a breach of privacy. The author then told a friend, who spread it, leading to the co-worker being exposed. The author's initial action of sharing the information, even if they later regretted it, contributed to the spread.\n\nEven if the author's intention was not malicious, the act of sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong. The key point is confidentiality and respecting someone's privacy. The co-worker might have wanted to keep her work separate from her professional life, and exposing her has caused her significant stress, possibly leading to her quitting. \n\nAdditionally, the workplace is a professional environment where personal lives aren't necessarily shared. The author's disclosure could be seen as a violation of professional boundaries. Even if the co-worker's actions are legal, the author's disclosure invaded her privacy and caused harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the act of sharing private information without consent is typically considered wrong, regardless of the content. The fact that the co-worker is a sex worker doesn't justify the author exposing her. The author's responsibility is to maintain confidentiality unless there's a legal obligation to report something, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for sharing their co-worker's private information without consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
