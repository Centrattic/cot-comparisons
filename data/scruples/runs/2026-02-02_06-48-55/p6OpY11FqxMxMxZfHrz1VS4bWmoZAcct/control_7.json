Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for exposing a co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation involves the author discovering their co-worker's online presence as a dominatrix, sharing it with another coworker, and then the information spreading despite the author's request for secrecy. The co-worker is now considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are: the author found personal, adult content of their co-worker, shared it with someone else, and then it spread. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, but there's the aspect of consent and privacy. The author didn't ask the co-worker for permission before sharing their work, which is a significant issue. The co-worker might not want their personal activities to be known in a professional setting, even if it's legal. \n\nThen, there's the part where the author told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did. However, the author is still responsible for initiating the sharing. By telling even one person, they broke the co-worker's privacy. The fact that the co-worker is now considering quitting suggests that this had a negative impact on their work environment. \n\nLegal aspects might vary, but ethically, sharing someone's personal content without their consent is a violation of trust and privacy. The author's actions contributed to the spread regardless of who was the second person to share. Also, the author's curiosity and judgment about the co-worker's activities might have played a role in their decision to share it. \n\nIn professional settings, maintaining confidentiality and respecting personal boundaries is crucial. Even if the co-worker's activities are legal, sharing such information without consent can create a hostile work environment. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious initially, led to consequences that affected their co-worker's job. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker's personal information without consent, even if the co-worker is in a legal profession. The answer should be A.\n"
