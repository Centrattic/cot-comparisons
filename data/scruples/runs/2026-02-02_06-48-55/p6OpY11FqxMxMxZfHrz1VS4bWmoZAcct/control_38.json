Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a co-worker who's a sex worker, and the author exposed her identity after finding videos of her work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The author discovered their co-worker's sex work through videos, shared it with a friend, and despite telling her not to spread it, the information leaked, causing the co-worker to think about quitting.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is responsible for the leak. The person directly shared the information with one person, who then broke the promise. The author might argue they didn't spread it themselves, but they initiated the sharing. However, since they explicitly told the friend not to tell anyone and the friend did anyway, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nBut wait, by sharing the information at all, even with one person, they broke the co-worker's privacy. Even if the friend was the one who spread it further, the original disclosure was the author's action. So, the author's initial decision to tell someone could be seen as the wrong step. They didn't have consent to share their co-worker's personal information, regardless of the context. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her private life, and exposing it without permission is a privacy violation. \n\nAlso, the work environment is important. Sharing such details could create a hostile work environment, leading to the co-worker quitting. The author's actions led to that outcome, even if indirectly. So, they might be considered at fault for not keeping the information private, despite not being the one who spread it further.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was the one who broke the promise, maybe the author isn't entirely responsible. But the chain of events started with them. The key point is that sharing private information about someone else without their consent is generally wrong, regardless of the context. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
