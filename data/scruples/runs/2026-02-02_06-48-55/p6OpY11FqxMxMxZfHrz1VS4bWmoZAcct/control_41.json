Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker who's a sex worker and the author found out through her videos. The key points here are about privacy, consent, and how the information was shared.\n\nFirst, the author found out their co-worker is a sex worker by watching her videos. Even though the co-worker might have posted them publicly, the author then told another co-worker and asked her to keep it a secret. But that friend didn't, and the whole office found out. Now the co-worker is thinking of quitting because of this exposure.\n\nI need to consider if the author is responsible for the spread of the information. The author didn't tell the whole office directly, but they did tell one person and asked for secrecy. The friend broke that, but the author's initial action of sharing it with someone else might still be problematic. \n\nEven if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her personal life and she might not want coworkers to know. The author had no right to share that information without her consent. Even if they were curious or stumbled upon it, spreading it violates her privacy. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't tell the entire office, the act of telling one person, who then spread it, makes the author partly responsible. They should have respected the co-worker's privacy and not shared the information at all. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they exposed their co-worker's private information without consent, leading to a breach of trust and potential consequences for the co-worker.\n"
