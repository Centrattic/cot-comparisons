Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for exposing a co-worker who's a sex worker. So, first, I need to break down the situation. The author found out their co-worker is a sex worker by accident, through a video. Then they told another co-worker, who ended up spreading the news, leading to the domme co-worker considering quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, sex work might be illegal in some places, but even if it's legal, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a problem. The author discovered this information through a video, which might be from a consensual session, but even then, disclosing that information without the person's permission could be an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe author tried to keep it secret initially by telling a friend to not spread it, but the friend did. However, the author's action of sharing it with someone else, even if they asked them to keep it secret, starts the chain. By telling someone else, they broke the co-worker's privacy. Even if the co-worker was the one who spread it further, the original act of sharing the information was the catalyst.\n\nAlso, considering workplace ethics, bringing up personal matters like this can create a hostile work environment. The co-worker might feel uncomfortable, leading to her considering quitting. The author's actions, even if unintentional, contributed to that outcome. Intentions matter, but responsibility for the consequences still lies with the person who started the spread.\n\nAnother angle: the co-worker is a sex worker, which is her personal life. Unless there's a conflict of interest or a violation of company policy, others shouldn't interfere. The author didn't have a legitimate reason to share this information. So, invading someone's privacy for no good reason is a breach of trust and ethical behavior.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the co-worker was hiding something illegal, there could be a duty to report. But in this case, the author didn't report it to authorities; they spread it among colleagues, which is gossiping and could be seen as bullying. The impact on the co-worker's job and mental health suggests that the author's actions were harmful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, leading to negative consequences for their co-worker. The answer should be A.\n"
