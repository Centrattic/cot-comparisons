Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who's a sex worker, and the author found out through some videos and then told another coworker, who ended up spreading it around, leading the sex worker coworker to consider quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered their coworker's involvement in sex work, specifically as a dominatrix, through videos. They told another coworker, urging secrecy, but the information spread. Now the coworker is thinking of quitting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Sharing someone's private activities without their consent is a big no-no. Even if the activities are legal, the individual has a right to privacy. The fact that the author shared this information with a coworker and the coworker spread it suggests that the author's initial act of telling someone was the catalyst. Even if they trusted the coworker to keep it secret, they can't control how others act. The author's action breached the coworker's privacy, leading to potential humiliation and job issues. The coworker might feel their professional reputation is at risk because their private life was exposed without consent. \n\nAlso, the fact that the coworker is a sex worker is relevant. There might be stigma involved, even if the work is legal. Exposing someone's profession in this context could lead to discrimination or a hostile work environment. The author didn't ask the coworker's permission; they assumed it was okay to share. There's no indication that the coworker wanted this information to be public. \n\nEven if the author had good intentions (maybe they were shocked or felt it was wrong), the act of sharing private information without consent is a violation of privacy. The author's responsibility is to respect their coworker's privacy, regardless of their personal feelings about the situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did expose their coworker's private information without their consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
