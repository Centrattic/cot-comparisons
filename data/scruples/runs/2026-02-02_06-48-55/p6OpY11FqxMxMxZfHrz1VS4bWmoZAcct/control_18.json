Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker who's a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their co-worker working as a dominatrix, told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did, leading to the co-worker considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are privacy, consent, and the context of the co-worker's work. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is a legal activity in many places, but that doesn't mean it's okay to expose someone's private work without their consent. \n\nThe author discovered the video on their own but then chose to share it with a friend, even though they tried to keep it secret. The fact that the friend spread it further is part of the problem, but the initial act of sharing the information was the catalyst. Even if the author felt shocked or uncomfortable, they had a responsibility to respect their co-worker's privacy.\n\nMoreover, the co-worker's work in the adult industry might be a personal choice, and unless there's a legal violation or direct impact on work, it's not the author's place to expose that. The workplace shouldn't be a place where personal, consensual activities outside of work are brought up without consent. \n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know the co-worker was a sex worker, but once they found out, their duty was to keep it confidential. By sharing it, even if they thought they trusted a friend, they breached that trust. The consequences (the co-worker thinking about quitting) indicate that the exposure had a negative impact, which supports the idea that the author was wrong.\n\nSo, considering privacy rights, the impact on the co-worker, and the lack of justification for sharing such information, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
