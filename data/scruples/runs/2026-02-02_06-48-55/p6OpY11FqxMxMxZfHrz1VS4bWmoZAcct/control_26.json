Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing a coworker who's a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their coworker working as a domme, shared it with a friend they trusted, and despite telling that friend not to spread it, the information got out. The coworker is now considering quitting. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered their coworker's private work in their personal life. Even though it's legal for adults to engage in sex work in many places, sharing that information without consent is a privacy issue. The coworker might have wanted to keep that part of their life separate from their professional environment.\n\nThe author told a friend not to spread it, but the friend did anyway. However, the author is still responsible for initiating the disclosure. Even if they trusted the friend initially, once the information is shared, they lose control over how it's spread. The author's actions led to the exposure, even if indirectly through the friend. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The coworker likely didn't consent to having their personal work shared. The author's actions, regardless of intention, contributed to the spread of private information. The fact that the domme uses a different name and the coworker found it through online means doesn't negate the privacy violation. \n\nWorkplace dynamics are important here. Sharing such information could create a hostile work environment, even if unintentionally. The coworker considering quitting shows the impact of the author's actions. The author might not have malicious intent, but the outcome is harmful. \n\nIn most cases, respecting someone's privacy is key. Even if the coworker is in a different line of work, the author shouldn't expose that without consent. The fact that the author shared it with a friend, even in confidence, was a breach of that privacy. The friend's failure to keep it secret exacerbates the situation, but the initial breach was the author's choice. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong for sharing their coworker's private information, leading to the spread of it and the coworker's distress. The answer would be A.\n"
