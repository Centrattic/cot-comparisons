Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for exposing their co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation is that they found a video of their co-worker engaging in a kink-related activity, told a friend not to share it, but the friend did, leading to the whole office finding out and the co-worker considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, adult content is legal if all parties consent. However, sharing such content without consent can be a privacy violation, even if it's legal. The author's co-worker might have used a stage name or kept her work private. The author, even if they didn't post the video themselves, shared the information with a friend and failed to keep it confidential, leading to a bigger leak.\n\nNext, the workplace context. Spreading personal information about a colleague, regardless of the content, can be considered unprofessional and harmful. The co-worker's job might depend on maintaining a professional image, and exposure could lead to harassment or job loss. The author's friend also played a role, but the author's initial disclosure was the first step in the chain.\n\nThen, the author's responsibility. They explicitly told the friend not to share it but then \"spilled the beans.\" This shows that they took the risk of sharing, even with a warning, and thus contributed to the problem. Intent matters here\u2014if the author knew the co-worker was in the video and shared it, that's a breach of privacy.\n\nAlso, the impact is significant: the co-worker is thinking of quitting. This indicates that the exposure caused real distress. Even if the author didn't post the video, they facilitated the spread by sharing the information with someone who then did.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' privacy is key. The author had a choice to either keep it to themselves or handle it discreetly. By sharing, they violated that trust. The fact that the co-worker is a sex worker might make her more vulnerable to stigma or judgment, compounding the harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions led to the exposure, regardless of the co-worker's profession. They are at fault for not respecting privacy and for starting the chain of events that caused the co-worker distress. Even if the content itself is legal, the unauthorized sharing is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
