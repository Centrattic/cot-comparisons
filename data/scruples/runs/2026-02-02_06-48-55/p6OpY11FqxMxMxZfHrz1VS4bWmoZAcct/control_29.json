Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing a co-worker who's a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their co-worker, who's a domme, on a phub. They told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did, leading to the whole office knowing, and the co-worker might quit.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author didn't directly tell the whole office, but they did tell one person and explicitly asked them not to share. However, that person did share, leading to the spread. The question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy and consent. The co-worker is a sex worker, so her work might be something she wants to keep private. Even if it's legal, sharing someone's private work without their consent can be a violation of their privacy. The fact that the author told a friend and then it spread beyond their control might not absolve them of responsibility. Even if the friend broke the promise, the initial act of sharing the information with someone else, despite the warning, could be considered the start of the problem.\n\nAlso, in a workplace, spreading such information could create a hostile environment or at least cause significant distress. The author's actions led to their co-worker considering quitting, which indicates a serious impact. Even if the author didn't spread it themselves beyond the first person, they are still the one who initiated the disclosure, which has consequences.\n\nAnother angle is that the co-worker is a sex worker. Depending on the context, some people choose to keep that aspect of their life private, especially in a professional setting. The author's decision to share this information without considering the potential repercussions on the co-worker's job and well-being could be seen as thoughtless.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had no malicious intent and was just shocked. But intent doesn't necessarily absolve responsibility when the outcome is harmful. The key is whether the action was wrong regardless of intent. Since the author didn't seek the co-worker's permission to share and instead shared it with a colleague, leading to a breach of privacy, it's likely they are in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably at fault because they violated their co-worker's privacy, even if indirectly. The answer would be A.\n"
