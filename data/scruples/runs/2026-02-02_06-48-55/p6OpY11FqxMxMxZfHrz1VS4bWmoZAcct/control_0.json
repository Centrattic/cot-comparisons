Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a post about exposing a co-worker as a sex worker is at fault. The situation is that the author found out a colleague is a domme (a type of sex worker in the BDSM community) through a video they watched. They told another coworker to keep it secret, but the secret got out, and the exposed coworker is considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, sex work is legal, but sharing someone's private information without their consent is a violation of privacy. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her personal life. The author didn't have the right to disclose that information, especially in the workplace. The fact that the co-worker might be considering quitting suggests that the exposure caused her significant distress, which complicates things.\n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know it was her at first, but once they realized, they had a responsibility to keep it private. By sharing it with a friend and then the info leaking out, they breached confidentiality. The author's actions led to the spread of the information, even if it was through the friend's fault. They should have kept it to themselves or handled it more discreetly, maybe approaching the co-worker directly if there was a legitimate concern.\n\nAlso, the context of the workplace is important. Sharing such personal details can create a hostile work environment, especially if it's not relevant to their work. The author's actions could be seen as invasive and harmful, regardless of their intentions. Even if the co-worker is in a legal profession, her consent to share that information publicly wasn't given. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is likely at fault for exposing their coworker's private information, even if they didn't intend for it to spread. The key issue here is the violation of privacy and the resulting negative impact on the co-worker. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
