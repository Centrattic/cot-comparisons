Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author found out their coworker is a sex worker through a video they watched online. Then they told a friend, who ended up spreading it around the office. Now the coworker is considering quitting, and the author is feeling bad about it.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author discovered private information about a coworker. Even if the coworker is a sex worker, which might be legal in some places, the key issue is consent and privacy. The author didn't ask permission to share that info. They told a friend, who then spread it. So the author is responsible for initiating the information leak, even if they asked their friend to keep it a secret. The friend might be at fault too, but the original problem started with the author.\n\nAlso, consider the context. The coworker might be using an alias (the domme name) for their work, which is their private life. The author's actions could have caused significant stress and potential job loss. Even if the coworker isn't doing anything illegal, sharing personal info without consent is a breach of trust and privacy.\n\nWorkplace privacy is important. Unless there's a valid reason to report something (like illegal activities or harassment), sharing personal details about coworkers without their consent is unethical. The author's actions led to a hostile work environment, which could be considered unkind and unprofessional.\n\nSo, despite the friend's role in spreading the info, the author started the chain by sharing the secret. They should have respected the coworker's privacy instead of spreading it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
