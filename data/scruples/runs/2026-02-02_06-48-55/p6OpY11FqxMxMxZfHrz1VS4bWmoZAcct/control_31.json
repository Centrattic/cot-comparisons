Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation is that the author discovered a co-worker who is a sex worker and then told another co-worker, who then spread the information. The co-worker is thinking about quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author found out that a co-worker is a sex worker through some explicit content. The author told another friend, who then spread it, leading to the co-worker being outed. The co-worker is now considering quitting because of this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Even though the author might not have had malicious intent initially, they did expose confidential information about their co-worker. The act of sharing someone's private information without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the author tried to keep it secret, the act of telling one person and then it getting out makes them partially responsible. \n\nAlso, the co-worker's job as a sex worker is a personal choice, and unless there's a policy against it in the workplace, the author shouldn't have spread that information. The co-worker might have wanted to keep their personal life separate from work. The author's actions caused distress and potentially a hostile work environment for the co-worker, leading to them considering quitting. \n\nEven if the author didn't know about any company policies regarding this, the key issue is the violation of privacy. The author had no right to share that information. So, even if the friend was the one who spread it, the author started the chain by telling them. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they exposed confidential information about a co-worker without consent, leading to negative consequences.\n"
