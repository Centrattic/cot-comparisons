Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker who's a sex worker. The author found a video of her online and told another co-worker not to spread it, but then the information did get out, leading to the domme co-worker considering quitting. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author discovered a video of their co-worker participating in a fetish scene. They then confided in a friend, explicitly telling her not to share it. The friend shared it, leading to a workplace issue. The author is now feeling guilty because their co-worker might quit.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nIn terms of ethics and workplace behavior, sharing someone's personal or private information without consent is generally wrong, regardless of the source. Even if the author found the video publicly, spreading that information violates the co-worker's privacy and could be considered a breach of trust. The fact that the author told their friend not to share it but still ended up doing so might make the author feel they were the initial source, but even if the friend spread it, the author's decision to share it in the first place is problematic. \n\nWorkplace privacy is important. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her personal business. The author has no right to disclose that information. The friend might have broken the trust, but the author started the chain by sharing it. So, the author is at fault for initiating the disclosure, even if it wasn't the final step. \n\nAlso, the impact is significant: the co-worker is considering quitting, which is a serious consequence. So, the author's action contributed to that outcome. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker's private life without consent, leading to potential harm in the workplace.\n"
