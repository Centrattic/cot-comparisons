Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their coworker who's a sex worker. So the situation is that the author found out their coworker is a domme (which is a dominant partner in BDSM) through some videos, then told another coworker not to tell anyone, but the information spread, leading the coworker to consider quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered their coworker's private work as a sex worker. Even though sex work is a legal activity in some places, sharing that information without consent is a privacy issue. The author's action of spreading this information, even if it was accidentally through another coworker, led to the coworker considering quitting. \n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know the coworker was a sex worker and didn't mean to spread it. But once they found out, they had a responsibility to keep it private. The fact that they told someone else, even a friend, and then the information spread, shows a breach of confidentiality. \n\nAlso, the coworker's job as a sex worker is her private life. Unless it's affecting the workplace directly (like harassment or illegal activities), others have no right to expose that. The author's curiosity and sharing led to a hostile work environment for the coworker. \n\nSo even if the author didn't intend to spread it, by initiating the conversation with a coworker and then being unable to contain the information, they played a part in the leak. The outcome was harmful to the coworker, leading to possible job loss. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. They violated the coworker's privacy, even if unintentionally, and contributed to a situation that negatively impacted her. The answer should be A.\n"
