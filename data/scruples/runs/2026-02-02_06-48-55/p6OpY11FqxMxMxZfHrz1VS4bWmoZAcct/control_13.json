Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. The situation is about someone finding out their coworker is a sex worker and sharing that information, leading to the coworker possibly quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author discovered a co-worker's sex work through a video, told another coworker to keep it secret, but the secret got out, causing issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points: The author found out about the co-worker's private work (sex work) without consent. Even if it was accidental, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally a violation of privacy. The author shares it with a friend, asks her to keep it secret, but she does tell others. However, the author is still responsible for initiating the spread of the information. \n\nEven if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's their personal choice, and unless there's a legal or workplace policy violation (like if the work is illegal or done during work hours), the author has no right to expose that. Workplace ethics usually require maintaining colleagues' privacy. Spreading such information can lead to harassment, discrimination, or a hostile work environment, which is a big no-no.\n\nAlso, the fact that the co-worker might quit because of this shows the negative impact. The author's actions led to that outcome, so they are at least partially responsible. Even if the friend broke the promise, the original disclosure by the author started the chain. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author violated the co-worker's privacy, shared personal information without consent, and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
