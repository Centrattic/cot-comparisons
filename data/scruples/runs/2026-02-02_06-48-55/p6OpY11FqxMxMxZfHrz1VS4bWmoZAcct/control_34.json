Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for exposing a co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their co-worker (a domme) and shared the secret with another co-worker, who then spread it, leading to potential job loss for the sex worker.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and privacy. The co-worker's involvement in sex work is a personal matter, and unless there's illegal activity involved, it's generally her private life. By sharing this information without her consent, the author violated her privacy. Even if the author didn't intend for the information to spread, they did tell someone, who then couldn't keep the secret. The author's actions directly led to the co-worker's distress and possible resignation.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace context. Sharing such personal information in a professional setting is inappropriate. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the act of exposing someone's private life without consent is a breach of trust and confidentiality. The fact that the domme mentioned her name in the video might be part of her public persona in that role, but her identity is still private unless she has publicly disclosed it herself.\n\nAlso, the impact on the co-worker is significant. She's considering quitting, which shows the severity of the breach. The author might not have considered the consequences, but the responsibility lies with them for initiating the disclosure. Even if the co-worker is in a consensual role, the workplace isn't the place for such revelations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, leading to negative consequences for their co-worker. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
