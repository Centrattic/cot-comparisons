Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author found out their coworker, a dominatrix, was doing sex work. They watched a video of her, recognized her, and then told another coworker to keep it secret. But the secret got out, and now the domme coworker is considering quitting. The author is feeling guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and consent. The coworker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, but that doesn't mean others can expose her without consent. The author found private content and shared it without her permission. Even if the content was public on a platform like Pornhub, sharing it further could be a violation of her privacy. \n\nThe author trusted a coworker not to spread it, but the information spread anyway. However, the initial act of sharing the information with someone else might have set off a chain. The key point is whether the author had the right to expose this information. \n\nSex work, while legal in some areas, is often stigmatized, and being outed can lead to social or professional repercussions. The author's actions likely caused harm to the coworker, leading to a hostile work environment. By spreading the information, the author contributed to that environment, even if they told someone to keep it secret. \n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by sharing private content. Even if they found it publicly, sharing it with others without consent crosses a line. The coworker's decision to quit might be due to the stress caused by the exposure.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author didn't have the right to share someone else's private information, regardless of how they found it. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
