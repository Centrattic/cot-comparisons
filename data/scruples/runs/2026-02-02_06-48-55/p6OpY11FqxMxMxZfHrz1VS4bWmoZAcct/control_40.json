Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for exposing their coworker who's a sex worker. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author found a video of their coworker working as a dominatrix, including scissoring and other kink activities. They told another coworker, who then spread the information, causing the coworker to consider quitting. The author is upset about the spread and feels bad.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The coworker is in a legal profession (assuming legal, since the question doesn't mention it's illegal). However, even if legal, there's the aspect of privacy. The author found out through a video the coworker posted publicly? Or did the author access it through some private means? The story says they found it on a phub, which is a site for adult content. If the coworker voluntarily posted that content online, maybe under a different name (as a domme), then the author found it. But the question is about exposing her identity. \n\nThe author told a coworker, who then spread it, even though the author begged them not to. The author's intent was to keep it secret, but the coworker broke that. However, the author is now being asked if they're in the wrong. \n\nLegally, in many places, sharing someone's adult content without consent is a violation, even if the content was originally posted by the person. If the author shared the information and helped identify the coworker, that could be problematic. But the coworker was already using a pseudonym, so the author revealed her real identity. \n\nEthically, the author had no right to expose their coworker's private life unless there was some legal requirement (like if it was illegal). Since the coworker's work is consensual and legal, the author's actions were a breach of privacy. Even if the coworker shared the content, she likely did so under a different name, expecting some level of anonymity. \n\nThe author's responsibility: They found out about their coworker's private activities and chose to share it, leading to her distress. Even if the coworker's actions were legal, the author's sharing of her identity without consent is a violation. The fact that the coworker might have been using a different name (domme name) suggests she wanted privacy. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they breached their coworker's confidentiality and contributed to the spread of information that caused the coworker to consider quitting. The coworker who spread it further is also at fault, but the original person who started it by telling someone is the one in question here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
