Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is at fault for exposing their co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation is that the author found out their co-worker is a domme (a dominant in BDSM) through content they saw online. They told another co-worker to keep it secret, but the secret got out, causing the domme co-worker to consider quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, sex work is legal, but there might be laws about privacy. The co-worker might have a right to keep their personal activities private. The author found out through online content, which could be public, but sharing that information could violate the co-worker's privacy.\n\nThe author told a friend to keep it secret but didn't, leading to the information spreading. Even if the author didn't directly spread it beyond the initial friend, they are still responsible because they initiated the disclosure. The friend's breach of confidentiality doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for starting the chain.\n\nAlso, in a workplace, sharing personal information about a colleague without their consent can create a hostile environment. The fact that the co-worker is considering quitting suggests that the exposure had a negative impact on their well-being and work environment. The author didn't consider the potential consequences, like the co-worker's mental health or job security.\n\nAnother angle: the author used the information they found online, which might be public, but using it to expose someone in the workplace is problematic. Even if the content is consensual, sharing it without consent invades the person's privacy. The co-worker might have a legitimate reason to want to keep their personal life separate from work.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The co-worker didn't consent to their personal activities being shared. The author's actions, even if not intentional to harm, still caused harm. The author might argue they didn't know it was their co-worker at first, but once they realized, they had a responsibility to keep it private.\n\nIn terms of work ethics, confidentiality is important. The author breached that by informing others, leading to a hostile work environment. The friend's role is also a factor, but the original breach was the author's. The author is in a position where they should have respected the co-worker's privacy regardless of what they found online.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is at fault because they exposed a colleague's private information without consent, leading to negative consequences. The answer should be A.\n"
