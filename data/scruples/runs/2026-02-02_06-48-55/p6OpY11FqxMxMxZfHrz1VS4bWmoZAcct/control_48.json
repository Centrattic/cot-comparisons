Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that someone found out their coworker is a sex worker by seeing a video of them. They told a friend, who then told others, and now the coworker might quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The coworker is a sex worker, which is a legal activity in many places, but it's personal. The author discovered this by chance, maybe through the video. They then shared it with a friend, even if they asked not to spread it. The friend did spread it, leading to the office knowing. \n\nThe author's actions led to the information getting out. Even if the friend was the one who spread it after being asked to keep it secret, the author initiated the sharing. So, they might be responsible for starting the chain of events. \n\nAlso, the coworker is considering quitting because of this. The author's actions caused harm to their work environment. Even if the author didn't mean for it to get out, they should have considered the privacy and maybe not shared it at all. \n\nBut wait, the author found it out accidentally. However, once they knew, they had a choice. Telling someone else, even if they asked for secrecy, was a mistake. Because they can't control what the friend does. So the author is partially responsible. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting privacy is key. The author violated the coworker's privacy by sharing the information. The fact that the friend broke the confidentiality is also their fault, but the author should have known better not to tell anyone. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They shouldn't have disclosed the coworker's private information, leading to the spread and potential harm.\n"
