Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for exposing a co-worker who is a sex worker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out that their co-worker is a sex worker, specifically a domme, by watching a video. They told a friend, who then spread the information, leading to the whole office finding out. The co-worker is now considering quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider privacy and consent. The co-worker might not have wanted her work as a sex worker to be known, especially at work. Even if the author didn't know initially, once they found out, sharing that information could be a breach of privacy. The fact that they told a friend and specified not to tell anyone, but it still spread, shows that the author contributed to the spread, even if indirectly.\n\nAlso, in a workplace, maintaining confidentiality and respecting others' privacy is important. The author's actions led to a hostile work environment for the co-worker. Even if the co-worker's job is legal, it's her personal choice and right to keep it private. The author's curiosity and sharing without consent could be seen as violating that privacy.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. The author trusted someone else not to spread the info, but it did spread. However, the initial act of sharing with a friend was the starting point. The author's decision to tell someone, even if it was a friend, set off the chain reaction.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the co-worker didn't hide her work life well, but that's not a justification for the author to expose her. People have the right to keep certain aspects of their lives private, regardless of their profession. The author's actions, even if done in confidence, broke that trust and caused harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared confidential information that was not theirs to share, leading to negative consequences for the co-worker. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
