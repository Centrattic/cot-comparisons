Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story is at fault. The scenario involves someone discovering a co-worker is a sex worker and then sharing that information, leading to the co-worker considering quitting.\n\nFirst, the author found out about their co-worker's side job through explicit content. They told a friend, warning her not to spread it, but the information leaked. Now they're feeling guilty because the co-worker might quit.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to privacy, and was it wrong to share that information? The co-worker's work as a sex worker probably isn't illegal, but it's a personal choice. The author's actions led to the spread of private information, which caused distress. Even if the author didn't start the leak (the friend did), they still shared the info first. \n\nThe friend breaking the confidentiality is part of the problem, but the original act of telling someone else without consent is also a breach. The author should have respected their co-worker's privacy, regardless of their own curiosity. Even if the co-worker's job is legal, it's not their place to expose it without consent. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
