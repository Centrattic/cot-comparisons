Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person found out their coworker is a sex worker and then told another coworker not to tell anyone, but the information spread, leading the domme coworker to consider quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, being a sex worker isn't illegal, but sharing someone's personal information without consent, especially if they're a sex worker, might be a privacy issue. The author discovered something personal and then told a coworker, who then spread it. Even if the author tried to keep it secret, the act of telling someone else could be problematic.\n\nThen, there's the workplace context. Workplaces have confidentiality expectations, and sharing personal information about coworkers, regardless of the content, can create a hostile environment. The fact that the coworker is a sex worker is a personal aspect of her life, and disclosing that without her consent might be a violation of her privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's initial motivation is important. They found the video out of personal interest (since they were into kinky stuff) and then shared it with a friend. This isn't a case of the coworker doing something harmful to others at work; it's a personal activity. The author didn't have a legitimate reason to know or share this information.\n\nEven though the coworker who spread it was the one who actually shared it with others, the original disclosure by the author was the first step. The author is responsible for starting the chain by telling someone. So, the author's action contributed to the problem, making them at least partially responsible.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' privacy is key. The author didn't have the right to expose their coworker's personal life. The fact that the coworker is considering quitting shows the impact of the author's actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
