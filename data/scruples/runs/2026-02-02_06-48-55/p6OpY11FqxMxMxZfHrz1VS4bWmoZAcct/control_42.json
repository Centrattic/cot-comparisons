Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker who is also a sex worker in the kink scene. The author found out through a video that their co-worker is into this, and then told a friend, who ended up letting the whole office know. Now the co-worker is considering quitting, and the author feels bad. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and boundaries. The author discovered private information about a co-worker, which they shared with someone else, even if they told the friend not to spread it. The friend did spread it anyway, but the author's initial action was to tell someone they trusted. Even if the author didn't mean for it to get out, by sharing the secret, they broke the co-worker's privacy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The co-worker didn't agree to have their private life exposed. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's their personal choice and legal in some places, but sharing that without consent is a violation of their privacy. The author's intention might have been curiosity or shock, but the consequence was significant, leading to the co-worker thinking of quitting. \n\nAlso, in a workplace, maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. The author's actions disrupted that. Even if the friend was responsible for spreading it further, the author started the chain by confiding in someone. They should have handled it more discreetly or not shared it at all. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they breached their co-worker's privacy by sharing private information, leading to negative consequences. The answer should be A.\n"
