Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker as a sex worker. The situation is that the author found out their co-worker is a sex worker, told another co-worker not to spread it, but the information got out and the co-worker might quit.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author discovered the co-worker's private work through online content. The co-worker might have kept it private, but the author shared this information, leading to a breach of privacy. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's a personal choice, and others might have different views on it. But the main issue here is the act of exposing someone's private life without their consent.\n\nThe author told one co-worker not to spread the info, but the co-worker did anyway. However, the author might still be at fault because they were the one who initially shared the information. Even if they told only one person, they started the chain reaction. The co-worker might not have been the only one, but the story's spread started with the author's disclosure.\n\nAlso, the co-worker is considering quitting because of the exposure. This suggests that the author's actions had a negative impact on their colleague's well-being. The author could have chosen to respect the co-worker's privacy, regardless of their personal views on sex work. Sharing such information without consent invades someone's privacy, even if the content was publicly accessible. The fact that the co-worker uses a different name (domme name) might imply they wanted it to be confidential.\n\nIn many situations, respecting someone's privacy is important unless there's a legal obligation to report something. Since the scenario doesn't mention any illegal activities, the author's disclosure seems like a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
