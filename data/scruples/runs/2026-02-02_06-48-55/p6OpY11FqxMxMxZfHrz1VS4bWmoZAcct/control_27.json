Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a co-worker who is a sex worker, and the author exposed her by sharing that information at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author found out their co-worker is a sex worker through a video they watched. They told a friend, who then spread it, leading to the co-worker considering quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are privacy and consent. The co-worker likely didn't want her personal activities to be shared at work. Even if the activities are legal and consensual, sharing such information without consent breaches her privacy. The author, despite trying to keep it secret, caused the information to be spread, which had negative consequences for the co-worker.\n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know the co-worker was a sex worker and that they were just sharing something they found. However, the fact that the co-worker used her real name (or a name that others recognized) and the context in which the video was found (work-related) suggests that the author should have been cautious. Even if the author didn't spread it directly, they initiated the conversation that led to the spread, making them partially responsible.\n\nAdditionally, the workplace is a professional environment, and sharing personal or private information about a colleague is generally unprofessional and can create a hostile work environment. The co-worker's potential resignation indicates the severity of the breach.\n\nWhile the friend who spread it is also at fault, the author's initial action of telling someone started the chain. Therefore, the author shares responsibility for the outcome. So, the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
