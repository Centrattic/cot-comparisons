Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted about exposing their coworker who's a sex worker is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found a video of their coworker doing sex work and then told another coworker not to spread it, but the information got out, leading the domme coworker to consider quitting. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author discovered their coworker's private work in sex, shared it with someone else with a confidentiality request, but the information spread. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some places, sharing someone's private content without consent can be illegal, like revenge porn laws. But the user is asking about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not just legality. Ethically, respecting someone's privacy is important. Even if someone is a sex worker, they have a right to privacy. The author didn't have the right to share that information, especially when they explicitly told someone not to, but it still spread. The author's initial act of sharing the information starts the chain of events leading to the coworker's distress.\n\nAlso, consent is a big factor here. The coworker didn't consent to her work being exposed. The author's actions, even if they thought they were trusted, violated that privacy. Even if the coworker is in the sex industry, the specific performances or content might be confidential and not meant for public exposure.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought it was justified because the coworker didn't hide it, but that's not a valid reason. People in the sex industry often use pseudonyms and may not want their real identities known. The fact that the author recognized her suggests she might not have been careful, but that's not the author's responsibility. The author still shouldn't spread it.\n\nThe consequence is that the coworker is considering quitting, which is a significant impact. The author's action, even if they tried to contain it, led to that outcome. They failed to keep the secret, and thus contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they exposed private information without consent, leading to negative consequences for their coworker. The answer should be A.\n"
