Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author found out their coworker is a sex worker and shared that information, leading to the coworker considering quitting. The author says they told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did, and now the whole office knows.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The coworker is a sex worker, which is a personal and sensitive matter. The author discovered this through explicit content they found online. The author then confided in a friend, instructing secrecy, but the information spread regardless. The question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nSo, even though the friend actually spread the information, the author's initial act of sharing the secret with someone else, despite the confidentiality request, set the chain in motion. The author had a duty to protect the coworker's privacy once they discovered it. By sharing it with a friend, even if it was a mistake, they breached that trust. \n\nAlso, the nature of the information is very private. Whether the coworker's activities are legal isn't the main issue here; the key is the breach of confidentiality. The author's actions caused harm, leading to the coworker's distress and potential job loss. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend for the information to spread, once they started sharing it with someone, they were responsible for the consequences. The friend's action was a result of the author's initial disclosure. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they exposed a private aspect of their coworker's life without consent, leading to negative outcomes.\n"
