Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for exposing their co-worker as a sex worker. \n\nFirst, the author found out their co-worker is a dominatrix through her online content. They told a friend, who then spread it, leading to the co-worker considering quitting. The key points here are privacy, consent, and the consequences.\n\nThe author's actions started with finding out personal information about a co-worker. Even if the content was public, sharing it without consent is a breach of privacy. The co-worker might have intended for that content to remain private or at least not shared in a professional setting. The fact that the friend spread it despite being told not to shows the author's initial disclosure led to the problem.\n\nWorkplace privacy is important. People often have different aspects of their lives they keep separate. By revealing this, the author invaded the co-worker's personal space. Even if the co-worker isn't in trouble for it, the stress of it causing someone to quit is a serious consequence. The author's decision to share this information, even with good intentions or curiosity, was inappropriate. They didn't consider the co-worker's right to privacy or the potential fallout. So, the author is at fault here.\n"
