Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down what happened. \n\nFirst, the author works at a startup with mostly young people in their 20s. They stumbled upon a video of a co-worker (let's call her Domme Co-worker) doing some kinky stuff, specifically scissoring and hitting someone. The author recognized her from the video and found out her Domme name and session info. The next day, they told a friend to keep it a secret, but the friend broke the promise, leading to the whole office finding out. The Domme Co-worker might quit because of this. The author is asking if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nSo the key points here are: the author found out about their co-worker's extracurricular activities, shared the information with someone they trusted not to spread it, but the information did spread despite the promise. Now, they're feeling guilty and wondering if they're to blame.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The co-worker is a sex worker, specifically a domme in the kink community. Is that illegal? Probably not, as long as it's consensual and legal in their jurisdiction. However, sharing personal information about someone's private life without their consent is a big deal. \n\nThe author's actions: they discovered this and told a friend under the condition of secrecy. The friend then broke the confidentiality, leading to a wider spread. The author might feel they trusted the friend, but the chain of events started with them. However, was the author justified in sharing it in the first place? \n\nEven if the information is true, sharing someone else's private activities without their consent is a breach of privacy. The author might have had the intention to keep it secret but by telling even one person, they opened the door for it to spread. The friend's betrayal is also at fault, but the initial act of sharing without consent is on the author. \n\nAlso, the workplace is a sensitive environment. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, the author didn't have the right to expose her without her consent. The fact that the co-worker is considering quitting shows that the exposure caused harm. \n\nSo even though the friend broke the promise, the author's decision to share it in the first place was wrong. They could have chosen not to tell anyone or handle it discreetly, but instead, they decided to confide in someone, leading to the information leaking. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated their co-worker's privacy by sharing personal information, regardless of the friend's role in the spread.\n"
