Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves exposing a co-worker who's a sex worker. \n\nFirst, the author found a video of their co-worker, who works as a domme, doing certain activities online. They shared this with another co-worker, telling them not to spread it, but the information ended up getting out, leading the domme co-worker to consider quitting.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, but the key issue is consent and privacy. The author discovered this information without the co-worker's consent. Even if they found it online, if the co-worker is using a different name or identity, the author might have a right to privacy. However, sharing that information at work could be problematic because it invades the co-worker's privacy and affects their work environment.\n\nThe author took the information to another co-worker and tried to keep it secret but failed. The result is that the co-worker is considering quitting, which indicates a negative impact. Even if the author's intention was to inform someone, they didn't have the right to share that personal information without consent. The fact that they did share it, even if accidentally, likely makes them at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the co-worker's privacy by sharing personal information without consent, leading to adverse consequences.\n"
