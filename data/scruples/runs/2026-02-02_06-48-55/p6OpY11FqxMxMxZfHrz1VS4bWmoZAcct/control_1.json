Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker who's a sex worker. The situation is that the author found out their co-worker is a domme through some videos, told a friend not to spread it, but the friend did anyway, leading to the whole office knowing. The co-worker might quit because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, being a sex worker is legal, especially if it's done independently or through legal platforms. However, sharing someone's private information without consent can be problematic. The author didn't consent to share their coworker's activities, so that's a privacy issue.\n\nNext, the author's responsibility. Even though they told one person not to spread it, the fact that the information was shared beyond that is part of the problem. The author initiated the chain of events by telling their friend, which led to the spread. So even if the friend was at fault for spreading it, the author started it. \n\nWorkplace dynamics are important here. Sharing personal information about a colleague can create a hostile work environment. The coworker might feel humiliated, leading to her considering quitting. That's a significant consequence. The author didn't have a right to disclose that information, regardless of the content.\n\nAlso, consent is key. The coworker didn't agree to have her activities shared. Even if the activities are consensual, it's not the author's place to expose them. The author's actions violated the coworker's privacy.\n\nPossible defenses: The author might argue they didn't know the content was real, but upon realization, they still chose to share it. The line between curiosity and intrusion is crossed here. \n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because they breached their coworker's privacy, leading to negative consequences. The act of sharing personal, consensual activities without consent is unethical and possibly illegal, depending on local laws. The fact that the friend spread it further doesn't absolve the author of their initial transgression.\n"
