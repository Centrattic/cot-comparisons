Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing a co-worker who is a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their co-worker (who is a domme) online and then told another co-worker, who then spread it, leading to the entire office finding out. The domme coworker is considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author discovered the video, then confided in a friend, specifically telling them not to tell anyone. However, the friend did spread it, leading to the office knowing. The author feels bad now because their coworker might quit.\n\nThe main issues here are: privacy, consent, and the spread of information. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, but that doesn't mean the information should be shared without consent. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, sharing that information without their consent is a violation of their privacy. \n\nThe author might argue that they were just surprised and shared it with a friend, not intending it to get out. But the fact remains that they shared private information, even if it's about someone who is in a legal profession. The coworker's personal life, especially if they chose to keep it private, is their own business. By sharing it, the author contributed to the spread of information that the co-worker might not have wanted public. \n\nEven if the co-worker is in a legal adult industry, the unauthorized sharing of their identity or work can lead to stigma, job loss, or other repercussions. The author's actions, even if unintentional, led to the exposure. They took the information from a private source (the video) and shared it with someone else, which breached confidentiality. \n\nThe fact that the author told the friend not to tell anyone but still did spread it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The initial act of sharing with the friend was the first step that led to the breach. The author should have considered the consequences before sharing any information about their coworker's private life. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author is in the wrong for exposing their co-worker's private information without consent, leading to potential harm to the co-worker's personal and professional life. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
