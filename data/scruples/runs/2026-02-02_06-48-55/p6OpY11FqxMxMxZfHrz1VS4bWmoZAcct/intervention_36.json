Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who exposed their co-worker as a sex worker is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author found out their co-worker is a sex worker through a video they watched. They told another co-worker to keep it secret, but the secret spread, causing the co-worker to consider quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, what's the key issue here? Privacy, right? The co-worker's identity as a sex worker is personal information. Even if the author found out accidentally, once they knew, sharing it without consent is a problem. The author tried to tell one person to keep it secret, but that person didn't, so the author feels responsible. But even if the other person spread it, the author's initial act of revealing the information was the start of the chain. \n\nIs it legal for someone to be a sex worker? In many places, yes, but that's different from respecting their privacy. The co-worker didn't ask the author to keep it a secret; the author took it upon themselves to tell someone else. So even if the other person broke the promise, the author shouldn't have told anyone in the first place. \n\nAlso, the impact on the co-worker is significant\u2014considering quitting. That shows the information was sensitive and sharing it caused harm. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, violated trust and privacy. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't know if the co-worker wanted this information shared. The co-worker might be okay with it, but the author assumed they weren't. Without consent, sharing such personal info is a breach of privacy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong. They exposed their co-worker's private life without consent, leading to negative consequences. Even if the co-worker's job is legal, the act of sharing without permission is the issue here.\n"
