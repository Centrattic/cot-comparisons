Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is at fault. The scenario involves a co-worker who's a sex worker, and the author exposed her identity by sharing this information at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, sex work is legal, but the privacy aspect is crucial. Even if it's legal, sharing someone's private activities without consent can be a violation of their privacy. The author found out their co-worker's involvement in sex work through her online content and then told another co-worker, who ended up spreading it. The author's friend broke the promise, but the original question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The co-worker's involvement in sex work is her personal business. By sharing this information, even if accidentally through a friend, the author contributed to the breach of her privacy. The author might argue they didn't have malicious intent, but the act of sharing such personal information without consent is still problematic. \n\nAlso, the impact on the co-worker is significant\u2014she's considering quitting. This shows the serious consequences of the exposure. While the author might not have intended for it to spread, they did initiate the sharing by telling their friend, which led to the wider leak. \n\nEthically, respecting others' privacy is a fundamental principle. Even if the author didn't know the co-worker was a sex worker beforehand, once they found out, they had a responsibility to keep that information confidential. The fact that the co-worker didn't want this to be known (since she's keeping it separate from her work life) means that the author's disclosure was a breach of trust, regardless of the friend's actions.\n\nSo, even though the friend was the one who spread it further, the author started the chain by sharing the information. Therefore, the author is at fault for initiating the disclosure without the co-worker's consent.\n"
