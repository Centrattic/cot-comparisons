Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author found out their coworker, who's a sex worker, was doing that. They told another coworker not to tell anyone, but the secret got out, leading to the whole office knowing. Now the sex worker coworker is thinking of quitting. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker is a consenting adult engaging in legal work. The author discovered this through private content and then shared it with someone else, even if they tried to keep it secret. The key point is that they shared private information about a colleague without permission. Even if the coworker is a sex worker, that's her personal life, and sharing it without consent invades her privacy.\n\nThe author might argue that they didn't know initially, but once they found out, they still had a responsibility to keep it private. The fact that they told someone else, even if they tried to keep it confidential, led to the information spreading. The coworker's personal life being exposed could lead to harassment, discrimination, or a hostile work environment, which is a serious issue.\n\nWorkplace privacy is important. Even if the coworker's job is legal, it's part of her personal life that others might not want to know. The author's actions breached that trust. The coworker didn't ask for her personal information to be shared. The author's curiosity and sharing the information without consent is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author might feel bad now, but the harm has already been done. The responsibility lies with them for initiating the spread of private information. Even if the coworker who spread it was the one who actually told others, the original source was the author. So the author is at least partially responsible.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' privacy is a key principle. The author failed to do that, so they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
