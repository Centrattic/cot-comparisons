Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person works at a startup, and most of the colleagues are in their early to mid-20s. They were watching some kink videos and stumbled upon a video that looked like their coworker. The coworker is a domme, as mentioned in the video. The author told their friend about it and asked her to keep it secret. But the friend didn't keep it, and now the whole office knows. The domme coworker is considering quitting because of this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out their coworker is a sex worker. The key issue is whether the author had the right to spread that information. Even if the author didn't create the content, by sharing it, they might be violating the coworker's privacy. The coworker might not have wanted their personal life exposed at work. The author's friend broke the confidentiality, but the author also played a role by initiating the conversation and not stopping the spread once they realized it was getting out.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker's job as a sex worker is part of their private life. Unless there's a policy against it, the author doesn't have the right to expose that. It's possible that the coworker isn't breaking any laws, just engaging in legal work. Spreading that information could lead to harassment or a hostile work environment, which is a problem.\n\nThe author trusted the friend not to tell others but the friend did. However, the author is responsible for starting the chain by sharing it in the first place. Even if the friend was the one who spread it, the author set the precedent by telling someone. They should have considered the consequences before sharing.\n\nAlso, the author might have had their own biases or judgments about the coworker's profession, leading them to share it. That's a personal issue, but the act of sharing private information without consent is generally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author shared their coworker's private information, leading to her considering quitting. Even if the content was found online, sharing it without consent is a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author is at fault.\n"
