Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for exposing a coworker who's a sex worker. The situation is that the author found a video of their coworker (who's into BDSM) acting as a domme, shared it with a friend who was told not to spread it, but the secret got out, causing the coworker to consider quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, sharing someone's explicit content without their consent is a violation of privacy laws, possibly even non-consensual pornography. Even if the content wasn't illegal to produce or distribute in itself, sharing it without consent is a major issue. The coworker might have intended the content for a private audience, like clients, not for public exposure.\n\nEthically, the author had a responsibility to keep the information private once they learned of it. Sharing it with a friend and then the information leaking out shows a breach of trust. The author's actions, even if accidental, contributed to the spread of the information, leading to the coworker's distress. The fact that the author told someone despite being aware of the potential consequences suggests they acted recklessly.\n\nAlso, the context of the coworker's work as a sex worker is important. Many people in that profession value their privacy and separation between personal/professional life. The exposure could lead to harassment, loss of income, or job insecurity, which are serious consequences.\n\nThe author's defense might be that they didn't know the coworker was a sex worker initially and were just curious. However, once they discovered the identity and the nature of the content, they had a duty to respect the coworker's privacy. The act of exposing someone's personal life without consent is generally wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nThe friend breaking confidentiality also plays a role, but the original leak came from the author. Even if the friend spread it further, the author's initial sharing set the chain in motion. So, the author is at least partially responsible.\n\nIn summary, both legal and ethical perspectives support that the author is in the wrong. They didn't have the right to share the information, and their actions caused harm to the coworker. The answer should be A.\n"
