Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for exposing a co-worker who is a sex worker. The scenario involves the author finding out their co-worker is a dominatrix through explicit content, sharing it with a friend, and then the information spreading, leading the co-worker to consider quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The co-worker is a sex worker, which is legal in many places, but sharing personal information without consent can be problematic. The author didn't ask the co-worker for permission before sharing. Even if the co-worker's activities are consensual, the author's actions led to her privacy being invaded at work. \n\nThe author told a friend not to share, but the friend did anyway. However, the author still has responsibility because starting the chain of sharing is on them. The co-worker's decision to quit shows the impact of the breach. \n\nAlso, work environments usually have boundaries about personal lives. Unless the co-worker's job as a domme affected her work performance or violated company policies, the author has no right to expose her. The author's actions caused harm regardless of intent. So, even if the domme's activities are legal, the author's sharing without consent is the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
