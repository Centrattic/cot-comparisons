Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that a co-worker is a sex worker and then sharing that information with others at work, leading to the co-worker possibly considering quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found a video of their co-worker, who they recognize, engaging in sexual activities as a dominatrix. They told a friend not to tell anyone, but the friend did, leading to the whole office finding out. Now the co-worker is thinking of quitting, and the author is feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The co-worker's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the content is publicly available, sharing it without consent invades someone's privacy. The author's intent matters too\u2014was it malicious or just curiosity? The author might argue they didn't know the co-worker would be affected, but that's not a solid defense. Also, the friend's role is mentioned, but the author started the chain by sharing the information initially, even if under the guise of secrecy.\n\nWorkplace confidentiality and respect are important. Sharing personal information about a colleague, especially something sensitive like their sex work, is generally considered unprofessional and harmful. The fact that the co-worker might quit shows the negative impact. The author's actions, even if unintentional, contributed to a hostile work environment for their co-worker. \n\nLegal aspects could also play a role, depending on the jurisdiction. In some places, sharing such content could be considered harassment or defamation. But even without legal issues, the ethical breach is clear. The author didn't have the right to expose their co-worker's private life without consent, regardless of how they found out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They violated their co-worker's privacy, contributed to a hostile work environment, and their actions had real consequences. The answer should be A.\n"
