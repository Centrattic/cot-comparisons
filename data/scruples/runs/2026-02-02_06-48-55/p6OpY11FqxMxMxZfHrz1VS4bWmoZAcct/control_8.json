Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for exposing a co-worker who's a sex worker. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author found out their co-worker is a sex worker by watching a video online. They told another co-worker, asked her not to spread it, but she did, and now the sex worker co-worker is considering quitting.\n\nI need to consider privacy and consent. The author didn't ask permission before sharing this information. Even if they were friends with the other co-worker, the act of sharing someone else's private information without their consent is a breach of privacy. The co-worker's identity as a sex worker is personal and could lead to stigma or job issues. \n\nAlso, the author might not be aware of the legal aspects. In some places, sharing someone's work in the adult industry without consent can be illegal, especially if it affects their current employment or reputation. \n\nEven if the author thought they were doing something right or out of curiosity, the key issue is the lack of consent. The author's actions led to the co-worker's distress and potential job loss. The fact that the author told someone else and it spread despite their request shows a lack of responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker who spread it was the one who actually did the sharing after being asked not to. But the original breach started with the author. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, leading to negative consequences for the co-worker. Therefore, answer A.\n"
