Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author found out that a co-worker is a sex worker through some videos they watched. They didn't tell anyone else at first but confided in a friend, specifically asking her not to spread it. However, the friend did tell others, and now the entire office knows. The co-worker might be quitting because of this. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author discovered something private about a co-worker. The first thing to consider is the co-worker's consent and privacy. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's her personal business. The author saw this information and then shared it with a friend, even if with a warning not to spread it. The fact that the friend did spread it doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. Because by telling even one person, they set the chain in motion. The author could have chosen not to share the information at all.\n\nAnother angle: The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by sharing with a friend, but they invaded the co-worker's privacy. Even if the co-worker's activities are legal, it's her choice to disclose or not. The author's actions led to the co-worker's distress and potential job loss. So, the author is at least partially responsible for the breach of confidentiality. \n\nAlso, considering workplace dynamics, sharing such personal information can create a hostile environment. The author might have overstepped by discussing a co-worker's private life, regardless of the friend's actions. The fact that the friend broke the confidentiality doesn't mean the author was right to tell her in the first place. The author should have kept it to themselves to protect the co-worker's privacy.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without the co-worker's consent, leading to negative consequences. The answer should be A.\n"
