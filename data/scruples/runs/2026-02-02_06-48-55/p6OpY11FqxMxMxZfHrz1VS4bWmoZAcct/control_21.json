Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their co-worker is a sex worker, probably a dominatrix based on the details given. They saw a video of her, recognized her from work, and then told another co-worker, begging her not to tell anyone. But the other co-worker did tell, and now the domme co-worker is considering quitting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author found out about their co-worker's private activity, which is consensual sex work. The co-worker isn't doing anything illegal, assuming the jurisdiction allows it. The author then shares this information with another person, despite trying to keep it secret. Even though they tried to stop the spread, the information eventually got out, leading to the co-worker's distress.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and consent. The co-worker didn't share this information, so the author's disclosure without consent is a breach of privacy. The author might argue they didn't know initially, but once they found out, they had a responsibility to keep it confidential. Telling even one person, even if they swore to keep it a secret, was a mistake because it's hard to control how others act. The author's actions contributed to the spread of the information, even if indirectly. So, the author is partly responsible for the co-worker's distress.\n\nAlso, the co-worker is a consenting adult engaging in legal activities. The workplace should respect her privacy. The author's decision to discuss this with others, even if they had good intentions or were shocked, was a violation of her privacy. So, the author is in the wrong for exposing her, even if the other person was the one who spread it further. The initial act of sharing the information was a breach, so the author is at fault.\n"
