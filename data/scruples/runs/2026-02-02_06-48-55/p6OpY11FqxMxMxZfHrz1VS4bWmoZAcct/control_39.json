Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker who's a sex worker in their personal time, and the author found out through a video and told a friend, who then spread it, causing the co-worker to consider quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author discovered their co-worker's private work as a domme. They told a friend, who broke the confidentiality, leading to the office finding out. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are privacy, consent, and workplace boundaries. Even if the co-worker is a sex worker, that's a personal matter. The author shouldn't have shared that information without consent. Even though the friend was the one who spread it, the author initiated the disclosure by telling the friend. So, the author is responsible for starting the chain.\n\nWorkplace privacy is important. People have the right to keep their personal lives private. The author's actions breached that trust, even if they thought they were sharing with someone they trusted. It's not their place to spread that information, regardless of their intentions.\n\nAlso, the domme's possible resignation is a consequence of the leak. The author's actions likely caused distress and a hostile work environment. Even if the author didn't mean to, the harm was done through their initial disclosure.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated their co-worker's privacy by sharing personal information, leading to negative consequences.\n"
