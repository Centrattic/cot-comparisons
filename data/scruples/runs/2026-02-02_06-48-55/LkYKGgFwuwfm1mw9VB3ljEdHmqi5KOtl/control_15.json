      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The context is about a girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a free pass for surfer dudes. The author says no because he feels it's cheating, but the girlfriend thinks it's just living in the moment while on vacation in another country.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The core issue is about boundaries in a relationship. The author set his boundary, and the girlfriend isn't respecting it. Cheating definitions can vary, but the key here is mutual agreement. If the relationship is monogamous, then any form of flirting or engaging with others could be seen as cheating by some standards. The author explained his feelings, and the girlfriend is still not giving a commitment. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that being in another country and vacationing allows her to \"live in the moment,\" which she doesn't consider cheating. But from the author's perspective, this would hurt him. The problem is that they have different views on what constitutes cheating. The author isn't wrong for setting his boundary. It's about how both partners communicate their expectations. If the girlfriend can't commit to not engaging with others, that's an issue for the relationship. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit usually looks at whether the person did something objectively wrong. Here, the author is clear about his boundaries, and the girlfriend isn't respecting them. The author isn't wrong for not giving a free pass. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the relationship's agreed-upon rules. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
