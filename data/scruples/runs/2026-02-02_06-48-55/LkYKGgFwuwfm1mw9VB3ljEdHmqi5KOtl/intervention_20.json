After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving his girlfriend a free pass about surfer dudes during her vacation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked if she has a free pass, and the author said no, considering it cheating. The girlfriend's reasoning is that being in a different country and living in the moment doesn't count as cheating. She can't promise him anything and will act on the moment.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual respect in a relationship. Cheating definitions can be subjective. The author feels hurt and sees it as cheating, which is his right. The girlfriend's stance is that she can't commit to not engaging in certain behaviors. \n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. If both parties agree on what constitutes cheating, that's one thing. But here, they have a disagreement. The author is setting a boundary, which is valid. The girlfriend isn't respecting that boundary by saying she can't promise anything. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for expressing his feelings and setting limits. He's being honest about his needs. The girlfriend's approach might be seen as irresponsible since she's not honoring his boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
