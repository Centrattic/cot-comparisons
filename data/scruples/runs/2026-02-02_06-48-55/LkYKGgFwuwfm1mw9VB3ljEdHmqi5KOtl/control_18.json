I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not giving their girlfriend a free pass regarding surfer dudes while she's on vacation. The girlfriend wants the freedom to interact with them, considering it's part of living in the moment during her trip. The author feels that this would be cheating and that it would hurt them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong here. The key points are about boundaries in relationships and mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. The author set clear boundaries by stating they don't view that behavior as acceptable. The girlfriend, however, has a different perspective, seeing it as living in the moment. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners agree on what is and isn't acceptable. If the author has expressed this to the girlfriend and she still feels she needs to do this, there's a communication breakdown. However, the author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. The real issue might be whether the girlfriend respects those boundaries. \n\nCheating is subjective and varies between relationships. If the author considers interactions with surfer dudes as cheating, then the girlfriend's actions might cross that line according to the author's viewpoint. The fact that the girlfriend can't promise she won't do it suggests she's not respecting the author's boundaries, which could be a problem. The author isn't wrong for not giving a free pass; they're protecting their own feelings and the relationship's integrity. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
