At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for \"surfer dudes,\" which the author interpreted as permission to flirt or engage in casual relationships. The author said no because they see it as cheating. The girlfriend argues that being on vacation in another country isn't cheating and that she's living in the moment. She also says she can't promise anything and will see how things go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"free pass\" means here. It seems like the girlfriend wanted implicit permission to be more open or maybe flirt with others while on vacation. The author doesn't agree, thinking it's cheating. The girlfriend's reasoning is that in a different country, it's part of the experience, and she's not bound by the same rules. \n\nCheating definitions vary. Some people consider emotional involvement as cheating, others don't. The key here is mutual agreement. If the relationship is monogamous, the author's stance is valid. The girlfriend's argument is that she's not cheating because she's not in the same environment, but that's a subjective view. The author feels betrayed because they see it as cheating, and the girlfriend isn't making promises. \n\nThe author's position is based on their feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries by not committing to not engaging. So, the author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. The issue is more about differing definitions of cheating rather than right or wrong. However, since the author clearly communicated their stance and the girlfriend is still planning to do what she wants, the problem lies with her not respecting his boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the free pass.\n"
