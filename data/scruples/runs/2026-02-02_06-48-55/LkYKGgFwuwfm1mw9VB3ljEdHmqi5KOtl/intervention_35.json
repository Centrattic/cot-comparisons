I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding surfer dudes. The situation is about trust and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly set a boundary by saying they don't consider flirting or hooking up with strangers as okay, even on vacation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels it's about living in the moment and can't promise not to be open to possibilities. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The author expressed their feelings and the potential pain if their girlfriend cheated. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive, not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nCheating generally involves betrayal, and the definition can vary between partners. The author sees it as cheating, while the girlfriend doesn't. However, if the girlfriend isn't respecting the mutual understanding of the relationship, that's a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue here is more about the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries rather than the author being wrong for establishing them. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
