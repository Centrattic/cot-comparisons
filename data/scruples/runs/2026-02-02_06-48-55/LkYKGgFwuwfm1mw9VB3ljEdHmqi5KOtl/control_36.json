I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving his girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The situation is about whether being with other people while on vacation in another country counts as cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and mutual understanding in relationships. The author made it clear that he considers this behavior cheating and would be hurt if she did it. That's his right. He's setting boundaries, which is important for any healthy relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that being in another country and \"living in the moment\" isn't cheating from her perspective. But she also says she can't promise anything and might act on her impulses. This inconsistency is key. If she can't commit to not engaging in behavior that the author finds cheating, then the author's discomfort is valid.\n\nThe question is about who's at fault. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The girlfriend is the one who can't respect those boundaries. In relationships, both parties need to agree on what's acceptable. If there's no agreement, it's a problem. So the author isn't in the wrong; he's standing by his needs. The answer should be B.\n"
