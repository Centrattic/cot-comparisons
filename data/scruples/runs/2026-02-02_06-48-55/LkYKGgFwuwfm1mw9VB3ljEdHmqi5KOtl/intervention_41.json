I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The author says no, considering it cheating, while the girlfriend thinks it's okay because it's a vacation in another country and about \"living in the moment.\" The author is feeling bad because she can't promise anything and will see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. From the author's perspective, they set a boundary and expressed their feelings about cheating. The girlfriend isn't respecting that boundary and is potentially going into a situation that could lead to infidelity. The author is concerned and feels hurt, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's argument is that being in a different country and \"living in the moment\" makes it okay. But that's a subjective view. Cheating definitions can vary in relationships, but the key is mutual agreement. The author clearly stated his stance, so if the girlfriend isn't committed to respecting that, there's a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't the one violating the agreement; the girlfriend is. The author communicated their expectations, so it's the girlfriend who's not honoring the relationship's boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
