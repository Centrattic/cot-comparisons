      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a free pass from her boyfriend regarding surfer dudes. The boyfriend says he doesn't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating to him. The girlfriend argues that it's not cheating if she's on vacation in another country and living in the moment. She can't promise anything and will just see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. The question is whether he's wrong for not giving her a free pass. Let's break it down. The key points here are mutual expectations in a relationship regarding fidelity. Cheating is typically defined as engaging in physical or emotional intimacy with someone else while in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's argument is that being in a different country on vacation allows her to \"live in the moment,\" which she equates to not cheating. However, the boyfriend clearly states that this would feel like cheating to him, so he can't agree to a free pass.\n\nNow, relationships often require mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. If the boyfriend has defined certain boundaries (like no physical intimacy with others), then the girlfriend's actions that cross those boundaries would be a breach of trust. The girlfriend's stance that she can't promise anything and will act on the moment suggests she's not respecting his boundaries. If the relationship is monogamous, then any form of physical intimacy with others would be cheating. The boyfriend is standing by his definition, so he's not in the wrong for not agreeing to the free pass. The girlfriend's actions would be the issue here, not the boyfriend's refusal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
