      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The author says they don't give her a free pass because they consider it cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if it's in another country and about living in the moment. She can't promise anything and says she'll just see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author has set a boundary that they consider any romantic or physical interaction with other people as cheating, even during a vacation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that in a different country and during a vacation, such interactions aren't cheating for her. She's not making promises and is open to whatever happens in the moment.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the expectations both partners have. In a relationship, it's important that both people agree on what constitutes cheating. The author clearly expressed their feelings about it being cheating, and the girlfriend seems to have a different perspective. The author isn't wrong for having their own definition of cheating. However, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014saying she can't promise anything and will see what happens in the moment\u2014might be problematic because it doesn't respect the author's boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with that, then the girlfriend isn't respecting their feelings. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The author set their boundary, explained their reasoning, and made it clear how they'd feel if it happened. They didn't agree to the free pass, which is their right. The girlfriend's inability to commit to not engaging in such interactions might be the issue here, not the author's stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the free pass. The problem might stem from a mismatch in expectations, but the author isn't at fault for sticking to their own standards.\n"
