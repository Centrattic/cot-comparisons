Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a guy who's in a relationship with his girlfriend. She's going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" from him regarding surfer dudes. He told her he doesn't give her a free pass because he sees that as cheating. He explained that it would break him if she did that. She responded by saying that to her, it's not cheating if she's on vacation in another country because it's \"living in the moment.\" She also said she can't promise anything and will just see what happens while she's there.\n\nThe user here is asking if the author is in the wrong. They think he is, but they want my opinion. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and boundaries. The author set a boundary by not giving her a free pass, which implies he expects monogamy and doesn't want her to engage in behavior he considers cheating. His response was about his feelings and the importance of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is setting her own expectations. She's saying that she can't make promises and that she'll live in the moment. This could be seen as a mismatch in expectations. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, her approach might be a red flag. However, maybe they had different understandings about the nature of their relationship.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for not agreeing to her terms. If the relationship is monogamous, the author is within his rights to set that boundary. However, if the relationship is non-monogamous or open, then his refusal might be the issue. The problem is that the girlfriend's actions could be seen as breaching the terms of a monogamous relationship, which would be cheating. \n\nBut the author's question is about whether HE is in the wrong. If he's not giving her a free pass because he doesn't want her to engage in behavior he considers cheating, that's not in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's response suggests she might have different expectations. It's possible that the author didn't clarify the relationship's boundaries earlier, but once he did, it's his right to expect her to honor that. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is unwilling to commit to monogamy, then the author might be right to not agree to her terms. But the author's actions here (not giving a free pass) are in line with maintaining the relationship's integrity as he understands it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting his boundaries. The girlfriend's actions and statements indicate she might not be on the same page, which is her issue. The author's stance is about his own comfort and the relationship's terms. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
