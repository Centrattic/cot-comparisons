      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the person's girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The author says no, because that feels like cheating to him. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if you're on vacation in another country and it's about \"living in the moment.\" She can't promise anything and says she'll just see what happens during the trip.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not giving a free pass. The key here is about the boundaries and expectations in the relationship. Cheating is a serious issue, but definitions can vary. The author feels that any form of interacting with others in a way that could be considered cheating is off-limits, while the girlfriend thinks it's okay in this context.\n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding and agreed-upon boundaries are crucial. If the author has never given a free pass before and this is a new situation, maybe the girlfriend is testing those boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is now changing her stance and the author is uncomfortable, it's about whether the author's feelings are valid.\n\nThe author's position is that he wouldn't handle it the same way if the roles were reversed, so he's setting a boundary. The girlfriend's response is that she can't make promises and will \"see what happens,\" which might be a red flag for the author because it's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nCheating isn't always black and white. Some people might consider emotional connections as cheating, others only physical. The surfer dudes part might imply physical interaction. If the girlfriend is going into a situation where she's open to physical encounters, that's a big deal for the author. If the author has made it clear that this is off-limits and the girlfriend is going ahead anyway, she's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being too strict. If the girlfriend hasn't actually done anything, just the possibility of it, maybe the author is overreacting. But given that she's aware of his feelings and still proceeds without commitment, it's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, considering that the author has set a boundary, and the girlfriend isn't respecting it, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining his stance. The girlfriend is the one not adhering to the agreed-upon rules, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
