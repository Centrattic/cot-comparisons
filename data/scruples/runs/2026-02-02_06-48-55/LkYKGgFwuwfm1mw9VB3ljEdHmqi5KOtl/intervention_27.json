After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes from the author. The author says no, because he feels that would be cheating. She counters by saying that since she's in another country and it's about living in the moment, it's not cheating. She also says she can't promise anything and will see what happens.\n\nHmm, first, relationships are all about mutual trust and boundaries. The author set a boundary by saying he doesn't think flirting or hooking up with others is allowed, even on vacation. The girlfriend is pushing back, saying she's in a different country and wants to live in the moment. But she's not making a promise to stay faithful. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. If they're in a monogamous relationship, then any form of flirting or engaging with others could be considered cheating, depending on their agreed-upon boundaries. The girlfriend's argument about living in the moment and the location might be her way of justifying her behavior, but if the author is uncomfortable with that, then it's a problem.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to maintain his trust and emotional boundaries. He's hurt and feels like she might not respect his feelings. She, on the other hand, might feel that he's being too restrictive and not allowing her personal freedom. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one who set the boundary and communicated his feelings, he's not in the wrong for that. The issue is more with the girlfriend not respecting his boundaries and not making a commitment. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He had the right to express his feelings and set limits. The problem is the girlfriend's lack of commitment and potential betrayal.\n"
