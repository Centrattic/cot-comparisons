      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding interactions with surfer dudes. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating because she's on vacation and in another country, and she can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clear that they consider any interaction with someone else as cheating and feel hurt if it happens. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as \"living in the moment\" and can't commit to not doing anything. \n\nRelationships are about mutual expectations and boundaries. If the author set clear boundaries that interactions with others are off-limits, the girlfriend's response of uncertainty might indicate she's not respecting those boundaries. The key here is whether the girlfriend was aware of these boundaries before the trip. If the author had communicated their stance clearly and the girlfriend still agreed to the trip with that understanding, then the author's stance is justified. However, if the expectations were not clear, maybe the author could have been more explicit. But given the scenario, the author did explain their feelings and the potential consequences. The girlfriend's inability to commit suggests a mismatch in their expectations. The author isn't wrong for upholding their boundaries, especially since the girlfriend hasn't been clear on respecting them. So, the answer leans towards B.\n"
