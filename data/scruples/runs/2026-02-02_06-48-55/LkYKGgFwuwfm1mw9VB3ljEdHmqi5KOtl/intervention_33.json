I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The person says no, considering it cheating, but the girlfriend thinks it's about living in the moment when she's in another country. She can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is setting boundaries and expressing that cheating would hurt them. That seems reasonable. Trust is a big part of relationships. On the other hand, the girlfriend is saying she can't promise not to engage with others, which might indicate a mismatch in expectations. \n\nIs the author wrong for not giving a free pass? Probably not. They're communicating their feelings and boundaries. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity. If she's unwilling to commit to monogamy during the trip, maybe the problem is her actions, not the author's stance. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their values. Answer B.\n"
