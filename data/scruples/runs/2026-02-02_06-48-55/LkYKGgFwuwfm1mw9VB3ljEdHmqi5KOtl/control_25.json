      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for surfer dudes, and the author said no, because they feel that would be cheating. The girlfriend's reasoning is that since she's in another country on vacation, it's about living in the moment, and she can't promise anything because she'll see what happens.\n\nHmm. So the core issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. The author set a boundary that they consider physical interactions with others as cheating, even when the partner is on vacation. The girlfriend has a different view, thinking that being in a different environment allows for more flexibility. The author is upset because they feel their boundaries are being disregarded, while the girlfriend isn't committing to not engaging with others, which might make the author feel insecure or betrayed.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the author is expressing their feelings and setting clear boundaries, which is generally healthy in a relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, isn't respecting those boundaries by planning to make decisions in the moment without commitment. But the question is if the author is wrong for not giving the free pass. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for boundaries is key. If one partner is uncomfortable with certain behaviors, the other should consider that. However, the girlfriend might feel her freedom is being restricted. But the author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings and communicating them. The real issue might be that the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's boundaries, which could lead to bigger problems. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set their boundaries, and it's the girlfriend who's not respecting them by planning to act on her impulses. The author's feelings are valid, and they shouldn't feel guilty for expressing their discomfort with what they consider cheating.\n"
