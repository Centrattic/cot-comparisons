I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding surfer dudes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass, meaning maybe she's considering hooking up with someone else while on vacation. The author says no, because it feels like cheating. She argues that being in a different country and \"living in the moment\" isn't cheating for her. She can't promise anything and says she'll see what happens in the moment.\n\nNow, the author is feeling guilty and asking if they're in the wrong. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts.\n\nI need to consider relationship boundaries. Cheating definitions can vary between couples. If they have an open relationship, maybe the author is overreacting. But if it's a monogamous relationship, then the author's stance is valid. The girlfriend is essentially saying her definition of cheating is different, which could lead to betrayal. The author is communicating their feelings and boundaries, which is important in a relationship. However, the girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries by not giving a clear commitment. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially if they're in a monogamous agreement. The girlfriend's approach might be self-centered, not considering the author's feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the free pass. The issue is more about the girlfriend not honoring the relationship's expectations.\n"
