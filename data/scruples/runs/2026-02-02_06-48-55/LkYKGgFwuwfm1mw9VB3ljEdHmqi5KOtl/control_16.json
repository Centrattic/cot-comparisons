I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for surfer dudes, and the author said no, because they consider it cheating. The girlfriend argues that being in another country and \"living in the moment\" isn't cheating for her. She can't promise anything and will just see how it goes.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is at fault here. From what I understand, the author set a boundary by not giving a free pass, which is their right in a relationship. Cheating can be subjective, but the author made their stance clear. The girlfriend, on the other hand, isn't respecting those boundaries by implying she might engage in behavior the author finds cheating. Communication is key in relationships, and it seems like the author communicated their feelings. The girlfriend's response of not being able to promise anything could lead to hurt if she does something the author considers cheating. So, the author isn't wrong for standing by their boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
