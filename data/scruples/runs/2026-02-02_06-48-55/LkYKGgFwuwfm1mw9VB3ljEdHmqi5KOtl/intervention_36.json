      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author (AITA) told his girlfriend he wouldn't give her a free pass on surfer dudes during her vacation. She responded that she thinks it's not cheating if she's in another country and just \"living in the moment,\" and can't promise anything, so she'll see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"free pass\" means here. It sounds like the girlfriend is asking if she can flirt or have interactions with other men (surfer dudes) while on vacation without any consequences. The author says no, because he feels that would be cheating, and explains it would hurt him. She counters by saying it's not cheating for her if she's in a different country, emphasizing spontaneity and not making promises.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's setting boundaries and expressing his feelings about what constitutes cheating. If their relationship is monogamous, he has the right to expect fidelity. The girlfriend's idea of \"living in the moment\" and not making promises might be conflicting with his expectations. He's being honest about his limitations and what he can't handle emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is expressing her own views and autonomy. She might feel that her personal comfort level is different, and she's choosing to be spontaneous. However, if the relationship is monogamous, her actions would still be considered cheating from the author's standpoint, regardless of location. Relationships require mutual agreement on boundaries. If she can't respect his feelings and the boundaries he's set, that's a problem. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual understanding. If the author doesn't give a free pass, but the girlfriend proceeds anyway, that's a breach of trust. The fact that she can't promise anything suggests she's not respecting the relationship's terms. The author's reaction is about protecting his feelings, which is valid. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's communicated his boundaries clearly. The girlfriend's refusal to commit to not interacting with others might indicate that she's not in a monogamous relationship, which could lead to incompatibility. The author is right to not give a free pass if that would make him feel like he's being cheated on. So the answer should be B.\n"
