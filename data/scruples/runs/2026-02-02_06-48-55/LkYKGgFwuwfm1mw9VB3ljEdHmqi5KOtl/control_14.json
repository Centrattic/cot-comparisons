      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want to give their girlfriend a free pass for interacting with surfer dudes during her vacation in another country. The girlfriend argues that since she's on vacation and in a different country, it's about living in the moment and she can't promise anything. The author feels that this is cheating and would be hurt if she did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. Generally, when someone is in a committed relationship, they expect exclusivity. The author's stance is that any interaction with others that could lead to something romantic or physical would be cheating. The girlfriend, however, thinks that being in a different country and in a vacation setting isn't the same as cheating, and she's okay with seeing how things go spontaneously.\n\nBut the key point here is mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. If the author and the girlfriend haven't discussed or agreed on boundaries, then there's a misunderstanding. The author's feelings of being broken if she does this suggests that he expects fidelity, but if the girlfriend doesn't agree, that's a problem. However, the author isn't the one engaging in the behavior; he's setting boundaries. The girlfriend is the one who's not respecting those boundaries by not committing to not engage in such interactions.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author expressed his feelings and set his expectations, but the girlfriend dismissed them. That's where the issue lies. The author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings and setting those boundaries. The girlfriend is the one who isn't respecting the agreed-upon terms or the expectations of the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
