I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never cared before. The issue arose after her friend came over, and the wife made a comment about the guy being a mess, leading to the husband feeling uncomfortable with the stains. The wife is upset that the husband is now asking her to get it cleaned, and she feels he's being jealous. They're both in a committed relationship now, so maybe the husband's feelings are valid because he doesn't like the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nBut then again, the wife argues that it's a memory from her past and that the husband never cared before. So, the question is, is the husband overstepping by asking for the dress to be cleaned, or is he justified in his discomfort?\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the husband might be feeling a sense of violation or discomfort knowing that another man's residue is in their home, even though the wife's past is consensual. However, the wife is entitled to her memories and might feel that the husband is being possessive or controlling. \n\nLegally, the husband isn't in the wrong because there's no law against having a dress with stains. But in terms of relationship dynamics, it's more about mutual respect. The husband has a right to his feelings, but the wife also has the right to her memories. The problem is that the husband is now making a demand based on his feelings, which the wife might see as unreasonable. \n\nBut maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. If the couple is in a committed relationship, the husband might feel that the presence of another man's bodily fluids is a violation of their shared space. However, the wife is allowed to keep mementos from her past unless they're causing a health issue. The husband's request is based on emotional discomfort rather than a health or safety concern. \n\nSo, is it the husband's fault for being uncomfortable and asking for the dress to be cleaned, or is it the wife's fault for not considering his feelings? The wife might be right in wanting to keep the dress, but the husband is also right in expressing his discomfort. However, the key here is whether the husband has the right to dictate the removal of the dress. Since it's the wife's personal item, unless there's a mutual agreement, the husband can't force her to clean it. But he can express his feelings. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings, but the wife might be in the right for wanting to keep her memories. However, the husband's request is reasonable if it's about health or cleanliness. If the stains are just a reminder and not a health hazard, the husband's discomfort might be seen as jealousy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's overreacting to a non-harmful situation and not respecting his wife's memories. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's within his rights to feel uncomfortable in their shared home. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the dress isn't causing any harm and the wife is keeping it as a memory, then the husband's insistence might be seen as controlling. On the other hand, if he's not in the wrong, then his feelings are valid. It's a tricky balance. \n\nI think the key here is that the husband's request is based on emotional discomfort rather than a tangible issue. The wife has the right to her memories, and the husband should communicate his feelings but not necessarily demand the dress be cleaned. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for overstepping by making it a demand. But some might argue he's justified. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit split, but leaning towards the husband being in the wrong because it's not about health or safety, just his personal feelings, and the wife is keeping her memories. So answer A.\n"
