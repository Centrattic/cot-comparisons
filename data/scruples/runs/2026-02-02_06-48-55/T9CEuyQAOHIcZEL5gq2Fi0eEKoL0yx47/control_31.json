I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the author never minded until her friend mentioned the stains. The wife's friend pointed out the spots, and the wife laughed about her ex making a mess. Then the author confronts her about not wanting the stains in their house, but the wife says he's overreacting and refuses to clean it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the author's feelings versus the wife's attachment to the dress as a memory. The author is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home, even though he's not jealous of her past. The wife sees it as a harmless memory and resents the author's reaction.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and perspectives: Some might say the author has a valid right to feel uncomfortable about something like that in his home, especially if they're married and sharing a living space. Others might argue that the wife's memories are her own, and the author is overstepping by trying to control her personal items.\n\nBut the author isn't saying he's jealous of her past, just that he doesn't want another person's bodily fluids in their house. That seems like a reasonable boundary. The wife, however, is defending the dress as part of her history. It's a clash of boundaries and respect for personal items.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express his discomfort, and the wife is not complying, which is causing tension. The question is whether his stance is wrong. Since the author isn't being jealous but is setting a boundary about something in their shared home, it's more about personal boundaries. I think the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate discomfort with something that could be unsanitary or make him uneasy. The wife needs to respect that, even if she doesn't agree. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
