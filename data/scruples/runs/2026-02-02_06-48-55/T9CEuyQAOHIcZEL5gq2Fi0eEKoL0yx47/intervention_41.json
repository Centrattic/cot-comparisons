I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the husband didn't mind before. The issue arose after a conversation with her friend where the wife made a joke about the stain being from her ex-date. The husband then objects and wants the dress cleaned or removed, but the wife refuses, saying it's part of her memories and he's being jealous.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband's discomfort with the physical remains of a past relationship, the wife's right to keep mementos from her youth, and the potential for jealousy or overreaction. \n\nThe husband isn't jealous of the relationship itself, as he states he's not jealous about her past partners. His main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a matter of personal preference and boundaries. However, the wife feels it's part of her history and refuses to let go of it, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on perspectives. On one hand, the dress is a keepsake with sentimental value. On the other, the husband has the right to his own comfort in their shared home. However, since the wife is the one who brought the issue to light by making a joke about the stain in front of the friend, it's possible that the husband's reaction is valid. But if the wife is insistent on keeping it, the husband might need to respect that unless there's a health or safety concern. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband could consider that the dress is part of her past and choose not to let it bother him, or they could find a solution that respects both their feelings. But if the husband is truly uncomfortable and the wife refuses to address it, that might lead to ongoing tension. However, the wife's argument that it's her memory and the husband is overreacting is also valid from her perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but the wife is also within her rights to keep the dress if it's important to her. However, since the husband is the one setting the boundary and the wife is refusing to honor it, maybe the husband is justified. Alternatively, the wife could be accused of not respecting his feelings once he expressed them. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after considering, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The wife's actions of flaunting the stain might have crossed a line, leading the husband to set a boundary. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
