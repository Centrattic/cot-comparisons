I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with cum stains that the husband now finds uncomfortable having in their home. The husband wants the dress cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband isn't jealous of her past, which is a relief. The issue isn't about jealousy but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared home. That's a health and personal comfort issue. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories tied to the dress and refuses to clean it, which is her right to some extent. However, the husband's request seems reasonable from a hygiene and comfort perspective. \n\nThe wife's argument is about memories and not wanting to erase the past. But the husband is the current partner who has to live in the same space. The dress being in their home could cause ongoing discomfort for him. The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings, especially since she laughed about the incident with a friend, which might trivialize the situation in his eyes.\n\nI should also think about consent and shared living space. When they married, they likely expected to share their lives, including their personal items. However, this is a specific case where the husband is now uncomfortable. It's possible that the wife didn't consider his feelings before bringing up the stains in front of him. \n\nThe husband's request is about cleanliness and personal boundaries. It's not about controlling her past, just about his current living environment. The wife's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. But maybe there's a middle ground, like finding a way to preserve the memories without keeping the stains. However, the question is about who is in the wrong now. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for people to have different thresholds for such things. If the husband is genuinely upset because of the presence of another man's bodily fluids, his reaction is valid. The wife's reaction, however, might stem from a place of defensiveness or feeling that her past is being judged. But in a marriage, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The husband's boundary here is about the physical presence of the stains. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband is not in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned. The wife's refusal is where the issue lies because she's not respecting his request. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
