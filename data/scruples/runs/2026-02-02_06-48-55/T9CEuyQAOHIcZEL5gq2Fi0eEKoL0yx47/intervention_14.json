I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the author is upset about it. The wife is keeping the dress without cleaning it, and the author wants her to get it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is not jealous about her past partners, which is a key part of the question. He says he doesn't care that she had sex with other guys, but he doesn't want another guy's cum stains in his house. The wife is offended, thinking he's being jealous and overreacting. \n\nSo why is this a problem? Well, maybe the author is overreacting because he's essentially bringing up jealousy even if he says he isn't. Cum stains are a bodily fluid, but they might not be dangerous. The wife has memories attached to the dress and doesn't want to get rid of them. The author is asking her to clean it, which she refuses. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's expressing discomfort with something that's in their home. But he's married to her, so she has the right to keep personal items. The author's issue isn't with the act of having sex but with the physical remnants. That might be a point of contention. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's fine with the fact that she had other partners but not the physical evidence, maybe that's a reasonable boundary for him. However, if he's not actually jealous but just uncomfortable with the stain, is that his problem to have? The wife might see it as him being possessive or controlling, even if he's not jealous. \n\nAlso, the wife's friend commented on the stains, and the wife laughed it off. The author only became aware after the friend left. The wife's reaction when he brings it up is defensive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not jealous but still wants the stain removed, maybe he's being unreasonable. The wife's feelings about her memories are valid, and the author is imposing his discomfort on her. However, if he's uncomfortable with something in their shared home, maybe he's justified. But cum stains aren't a health hazard, so maybe his reason is just personal preference. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is about health, cleanliness, or just emotional discomfort. If it's the latter, then it's more about his feelings than hers. The wife might be right in refusing to clean it because it's her personal history. The author might need to let it go unless it's affecting their health or home environment. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is overreacting and in the wrong because he's not actually jealous but is making a big deal out of a personal item. But if he's uncomfortable with it in their home, he could have just avoided looking at it. However, the fact that he's making it a point to ask her to clean it might be crossing into controlling behavior. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the issue is more about his personal discomfort rather than a valid health or safety concern, and the wife has the right to keep her personal items without being forced to alter them.\n"
