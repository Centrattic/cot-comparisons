I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it being in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband didn't mind his wife's past relationships and hadn't noticed the dress before. The issue arose when the wife casually mentioned the stains and the husband then asked to have it cleaned. The wife is upset because he's being \"jealous\" and doesn't want to clean it. \n\nSo, is the husband overreacting? Well, from his perspective, he's uncomfortable with another person's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a reasonable concern for hygiene and personal boundaries. But the wife views it as a part of her memories and doesn't see an issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband brought up his feelings after the fact, which might have caught the wife off guard. However, his concern isn't about jealousy per se but about the physical presence of another person's stains in their home. The wife's response that he's being jealous might be dismissive of his valid hygiene concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife hasn't done anything wrong by keeping the dress, especially since she's been open about it. The husband's request is about cleaning it, not getting rid of it. The problem is the wife's refusal to clean it despite the husband's discomfort. \n\nI think the husband isn't wrong in wanting the stains removed. It's about maintaining a clean home environment. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his feelings. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
