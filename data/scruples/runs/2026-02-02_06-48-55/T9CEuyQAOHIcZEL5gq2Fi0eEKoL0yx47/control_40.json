I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house.\n\nFirst, the husband says he's not jealous of her past partners. He's been okay with the dress being in the closet until a friend comments on the stains. Then he confronts his wife. The wife is upset because he never mentioned it before and she feels he's overreacting. She doesn't want to get it cleaned because it has good memories for her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. In a marriage, respect for each other's feelings is important. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, which is a hygiene and comfort issue. On the other hand, the wife has emotional attachments to the dress and her past, which she's entitled to. \n\nThe husband didn't have a problem before the friend mentioned it. Maybe he was okay with the stains not being obvious and the wife not bringing it up. Now that it's a point of contention, they need to resolve it. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? He's asking for the dress to be cleaned for his own comfort. The wife is resisting because of sentimental reasons. Both have valid points. However, in a relationship, if one partner's comfort is affected by something the other finds sentimental, there might be a discussion about boundaries. \n\nThe husband isn't being jealous in the traditional sense, but rather about the physical presence of another man's cum in their home. That's a personal boundary. The wife is also within her rights to hold onto her memories. \n\nBut maybe the husband is overreacting because the dress is a memory for the wife and not an active issue. However, the fact that he's uncomfortable with it in their home is a valid feeling. The key here is whether his request is unreasonable. If he's not asking her to lie about it or change her memories, just to clean it for hygiene, then his stance might be understandable. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife is not causing him harm beyond his own feelings, then the husband might be the one overstepping by making her remove a sentimental item. \n\nBut the presence of another person's bodily fluids in the home is a cleanliness issue. So the husband's request is about the state of their home. The wife's response is about her personal history. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. Depending on cultural norms and personal perspectives. Some might say the husband is in the right to ask for cleanliness, others might say the wife's memories are her own and should be respected. \n\nBut the key here is that the husband's issue isn't jealousy but the physical presence of the stains. If that's the case, then he's not in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, as it's about his comfort in their shared home. However, if the wife is not open to that, it's a conflict in values. \n\nIn the end, since both have valid points, but the husband's request is about his home's cleanliness and his comfort, which are reasonable, then the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But if the wife's emotional attachment is more important and the husband is overstepping by making her clean it, then A. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't prevent the wife from keeping the dress, just asked her to clean it. If she's not willing, then maybe the author is within his right to express his discomfort. So answer B.\n"
