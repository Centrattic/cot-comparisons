I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned because it's a memory, and the husband wants it cleaned because he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in his house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is about comfort and maybe a bit of disgust. Cum stains, even though they might be old, could be a hygiene issue or a personal boundary. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as a cherished memory from her past. She might feel that the husband is being jealous or overreacting, even though he says he's not jealous of her past partners.\n\nBut wait, the husband says he's not jealous about her past partners. So his issue is specifically with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Is that a reasonable concern? Some people might find that gross, while others might not. The wife's argument is about memories, which are important to her. \n\nMarriage involves compromise. The husband is asking for something that's in his comfort zone, while the wife is holding onto her memory. Is it fair for the husband to demand the dress be cleaned? Maybe, if it's a matter of health or sanitation. But if the stains are old and not an immediate health risk, is it really a problem? \n\nAlso, the wife's friend made a comment about the spots, which might have made the husband more aware of it. The husband's reaction came after that conversation, which might have triggered his discomfort. The wife's friends' reaction (\"ew!\") could have influenced the husband's perspective. \n\nI wonder about the dynamics here. Is the husband's request reasonable? If the husband is uncomfortable, shouldn't the wife be considerate of his feelings? Or is the husband being too controlling by not respecting her personal memories? \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often have mementos from their past that others might find odd. The wife might feel that her personal history with the dress is her own, and the husband's request is an overreach. However, the husband is in his rights to feel uncomfortable about something in his home. \n\nMaybe the key is communication. They talked about it, but the wife is refusing to comply. The husband might feel that his request is valid, but the wife sees it as unnecessary. It's a conflict between personal comfort and sentimental value. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband's request is reasonable. If the husband is genuinely disgusted by the presence of another man's bodily fluids, maybe it's unreasonable to expect him to live with that. On the other hand, the wife has the right to keep her personal items. \n\nBut since they are married, they need to find a middle ground. The husband could suggest discreetly getting the dress cleaned if it's important to him, while the wife could consider his feelings. However, if she refuses to budge, maybe the husband is in a tough spot. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the husband's request is about health or safety, maybe not. But if it's just about discomfort without a health risk, maybe he's overreacting. The wife's memories are part of her identity, and the husband's request could be seen as dismissive of her past. \n\nHmm. I think the husband is not necessarily wrong because he's expressing his discomfort, but the wife's reaction could be seen as dismissive. However, if the dress is a cherished memory and the husband's demand is about a non-health issue, maybe the husband is overstepping. It's a bit of a gray area, but I lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's stating his boundaries, even if the wife feels differently.\n"
