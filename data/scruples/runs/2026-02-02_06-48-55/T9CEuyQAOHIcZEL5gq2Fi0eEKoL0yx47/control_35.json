I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the husband is upset about his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The wife has kept it in their closet, and now the husband wants it cleaned. She's refusing, saying he's being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries, respect, and mutual consideration in a relationship. The husband isn't jealous of her past relationships but is unsettled by the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to clean it.\n\nSo, from a social perspective, it's common for people to have differing thresholds for discomfort. The husband's request might be about maintaining a clean home environment, which is reasonable. However, the wife's right to keep personal mementos is also valid. Where it might tip into being \"wrong\" is if the husband is being controlling or if there's a lack of respect for her feelings. \n\nBut the husband isn't trying to control her past; he's just asking for the stain to be removed. He's not forbidding her from keeping the dress, just wants it cleaned. The wife, on the other hand, is dismissing his feelings by calling him jealous, which could be a problem if she's invalidating his concerns without understanding. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both need to respect each other's feelings. The husband expressing his discomfort isn't inherently wrong. However, if the wife feels that her memories are being dismissed, that's a conflict. The line between being reasonable and being overbearing is thin here. \n\nI think the husband's stance is about his personal boundaries, which he has the right to set. The wife might be in the wrong if she's refusing to accommodate his request without discussion. But it's a mutual issue. The question is whether the husband is overstepping by objecting to the stain, or if he's within his rights. \n\nSince the husband isn't asking her to get rid of the dress, just clean it, and the wife is refusing to respect his request, maybe the husband isn't wrong. It's about mutual respect. If the wife is keeping a personal item that causes discomfort to her partner, but the husband is not being controlling in other aspects, then his request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
