I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's old prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The wife has had this dress for a long time and it's part of her memories. She didn't keep it to be offensive, but rather as a keepsake. The author, on the other hand, is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, even if it's from the past. \n\nEmotionally, the wife is attached to the memories associated with the dress. She might see it as a personal memento and might feel that the author is being overly possessive or jealous. The author's issue isn't about her past relationships but about the physical presence of someone else's bodily fluids in their current home. That's a valid health and cleanliness concern, even if it's old.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction comes after a specific incident where the wife mentioned the stains in front of a friend. The author felt it was inappropriate and wanted it cleaned. The wife's refusal might make the author feel disrespected or dismissed. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the dress was in the closet for a long time, and the author never had an issue before. The problem arose after the friend's comment and the wife's casual mention of it. The author's objection is more about the current presence of the stains rather than the act itself. The wife's right to her memories versus the husband's discomfort in their shared home.\n\nLegally and socially, the dress is her property, and unless it's a health hazard (which dried cum isn't), she has the right to keep it. The author's request is about personal discomfort, which is understandable, but it's pushing the boundaries of what's reasonable. The wife's right to her memories and privacy might take precedence here. \n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but the way they're handling it might be problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the dress is hers and the author is asking her to clean it because of personal discomfort, which isn't a valid reason for others, the author might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they are imposing their discomfort on the wife's personal items without a strong justification.\n"
