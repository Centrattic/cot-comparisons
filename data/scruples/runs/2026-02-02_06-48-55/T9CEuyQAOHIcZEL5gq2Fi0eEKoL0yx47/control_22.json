I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband finding out that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a previous partner, and he's upset about that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting those stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband mentions he's not jealous of her past partners. So his issue isn't about jealousy, but specifically about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a key point. Jealousy is different from a personal boundary about having such stains in the house.\n\nThe wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never thought about it until this incident. The friend's comment about the stains and the wife's reaction led the husband to confront her. He's asking her to get it cleaned, and she's refusing, saying it's about her memories and that he should stop being jealous. The husband's stance is about the physical presence of the stains, not the emotional aspect of her past.\n\nNow, is he wrong for this? Well, people have different boundaries about things like this. Some might find it gross, others might not. The husband's discomfort is about the actual stains, not the fact that she had sex before. He's not being possessive in the traditional sense of jealousy, but rather about the cleanliness and presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is holding onto her memories. She might view the dress as a sentimental item from her past. The question is whether the husband is overstepping by asking her to clean it. If a person feels uncomfortable about such a thing, their feelings are valid. But the wife's right to keep a personal memento versus the husband's comfort in their shared space.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband did communicate his feelings, but the wife is resisting, possibly because she values her memories. However, the husband is entitled to his own comfort level. So, if he genuinely feels that having another person's bodily fluids in the house is unacceptable, that's his boundary. The wife's refusal to clean it might be where the problem lies, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong for having that boundary.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his issue is about the physical stains, not jealousy. He's expressing a personal boundary that's valid. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband's stance isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
