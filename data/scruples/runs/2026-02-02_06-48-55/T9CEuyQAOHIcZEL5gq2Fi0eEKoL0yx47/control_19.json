I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband didn't mind his wife's past relationships before, but now he's uncomfortable with the cum stains on her old dress. The wife doesn't want to have it cleaned because it's a memory for her. They had an argument about it, and she's not listening. The user wants to know if the husband is wrong for feeling this way.\n\nHmm, so the husband is expressing a boundary about bodily fluids from a past partner in their home. Is it reasonable? Well, even if they're not jealous about her past, the presence of another person's bodily fluids might be a hygiene issue. Also, in a marriage, mutual respect for each other's feelings is important. The husband is asking her to clean it for his comfort, which is a valid request. However, the wife is holding onto her memories, which is also personal. \n\nBut wait, the husband isn't upset about the affair itself, just the physical remnants. That's different from jealousy. So maybe he's not wrong for wanting it cleaned. However, the wife's refusal to comply might be an issue. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making the request. Since he's not being jealous but setting a boundary about something in their shared home, I think he's within his rights. The problem might be in how they're communicating, but the request itself is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
