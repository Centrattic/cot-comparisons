I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a man who is upset that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past partner and he doesn't want it in their house. His wife is keeping it, not wanting to get it cleaned, and he's getting frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: he's uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a reasonable feeling, right? Even if he's not jealous about her past, the physical presence of someone else's \"cum stains\" might be off-putting. It's about cleanliness and personal space. On the other hand, the wife's perspective: she has good memories tied to the dress, and she's not doing anything wrong by keeping it. She's not hiding it; she showed it to a friend. She might feel that her husband is overreacting and that he's being jealous despite saying he's not.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks maybe he is, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are about personal boundaries, respect for each other's past, and the emotional significance of objects. The husband's discomfort is understandable, but does that give him the right to demand the dress be cleaned? The wife has the right to keep mementos from her past unless they cause harm or disturbance. However, if the presence of the dress is causing ongoing conflict and the husband is genuinely uncomfortable, it's a matter of mutual respect and finding a compromise.\n\nBut the wife isn't removing it despite his repeated requests. Is it his responsibility to accept her choice even if it makes him uneasy? Or does she have to consider his feelings? It's a bit of a grey area. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate and find solutions that respect each other's needs. If the husband is so bothered by it, maybe the wife could get it dry cleaned to address his concern without having to discard the dress. However, if he's insisting on a change that she's not willing to make, he might be imposing his preferences on her, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlternatively, if she's not violating any boundaries and is not causing harm, then the husband's reaction might be seen as unnecessary. Jealousy isn't just about current actions but also about past experiences, even if they're in the form of a dress. The line between respecting her past and his present comfort is thin here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the dress is in their shared home and contains someone else's bodily fluids, which can carry health risks, there's a case for the husband's side. However, the emotional value of the dress to the wife is also valid. If dry cleaning is an option, maybe that's a compromise. But the wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as not respecting his feelings, especially if he's made them clear multiple times. \n\nHowever, the husband's reaction is about personal discomfort rather than a health hazard. Unless there are actual health concerns (which the story doesn't mention), it might be more about his own discomfort with the idea rather than any tangible issue. So maybe the author is overreacting because the presence of the stains isn't harming him, and the wife's right to keep her memento is more important. \n\nBut on the flip side, if the husband is uncomfortable, it's his home too, and he has a right to feel that way. It's about mutual respect and compromise. Since the wife isn't willing to budge, perhaps the husband is in the wrong for not respecting her emotional attachment. Or maybe he's justified because it's his home and he wants to avoid something that makes him uneasy. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. The key factors are: the presence of someone else's bodily fluids in the home, the emotional significance of the dress, and the communication between them. If the husband is okay with her past but not the physical reminder, it's a valid personal boundary. However, if the wife is unwilling to accommodate that boundary by cleaning it, then maybe he's not in the wrong for asking. But if the dress is a cherished item and cleaning would remove the memories, she might have a right to keep it as is. \n\nIn conclusion, if the husband is genuinely uncomfortable and the wife is not willing to take even a simple step like dry cleaning to address it, the husband's request is reasonable. Therefore, the wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his feelings. However, if the husband is fixated on something that's not a health issue and is being unreasonable, then he might be in the wrong. Given the story, the husband's argument is about personal comfort rather than health, so maybe the wife is within her rights to keep it, making the husband the one in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the wife's actions aren't violating any rules unless they were agreed upon otherwise. So if there was no prior agreement about items in the home, the wife can keep her dress. The husband's request is a new boundary that wasn't discussed before. If he's bringing it up now, he might be overstepping. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because the wife's keeping the dress isn't inherently wrong, and the husband is imposing his new boundary without mutual agreement.\n"
