I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband being upset about his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The wife is keeping it, and the husband wants it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is that he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home, even though he's not jealous. He's clear that it's not about jealousy but about the presence of another man's cum. The wife, on the other hand, has sentimental value attached to the dress and her memories from that night. She doesn't see a problem with keeping it as is and is upset that her husband is overreacting.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and relationships. In many relationships, partners have different thresholds for what's acceptable. The husband's discomfort is valid because it's his home, and he's expressing a personal boundary. However, the wife also has her own emotional attachment. The key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not objecting to her past relationships but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids, it might be seen as a reasonable request. On the other hand, the wife's right to keep her personal mementos is also valid.\n\nBut maybe the husband is overstepping by making her remove something that's important to her. The question is about whose boundary is more important. The husband is asking her to clean the dress, which would remove the stains, so he's not necessarily asking her to discard the dress. However, the wife is refusing, which might be a valid stance because she's not obligated to clean it if it's her personal item.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's discomfort is understandable, but the wife's right to keep her personal items should also be respected. However, since he's the one making the request and she's not obliging, maybe the husband is overreacting because he's trying to impose his comfort on her personal belongings. Alternatively, if the husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared home, he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned. The wife's refusal might be inconsiderate of his feelings. But since the husband is the one bringing it up and the wife is standing her ground, the answer could hinge on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Cleaning the dress would resolve the issue without destroying the sentimental value. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, but the wife isn't in the wrong for not cleaning it if it's her choice. However, the husband is making a request that's affecting their shared living space, so he's not in the wrong for expressing that. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
