I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for a long time, 41, and he says he's not jealous about her past partners. The dress was in the closet for a long time, and he hadn't noticed the stains until the incident with the friend. The wife's friend pointed out the spots, and the wife made a joke about her date being a mess. Then the wife showed the dress again, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author's main issue is not with the fact that she had sex before, but with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He wants it cleaned, while she refuses, saying he's overreacting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's uncomfortable with another man's cum in their house. That's a personal discomfort, and he has the right to his feelings. However, the wife has a sentimental attachment to the dress as a memory. The key here is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not jealous of her past, but just wants the stains removed, it's more about cleanliness and comfort in their shared space. \n\nOn the other side, the wife might feel that her memories are being dismissed. She might see the dress as her personal history and not something that needs to be altered for his comfort. But the house is a shared space, and the presence of another man's bodily fluids could be seen as a health or hygiene issue. \n\nHowever, in many relationships, personal items and memories are respected. If the dress is a sentimental item, he might be overstepping by insisting on cleaning it. But cum is a bodily fluid that can carry diseases, so maybe there's a health aspect. However, if the dress hasn't been worn recently and is just a memory item, the risk might be low. \n\nThe author's request seems reasonable from a cleanliness standpoint, but the wife's refusal is about her memories. It's a conflict between personal comfort and sentimental value. The question is whether his reaction is over the top. He's not asking her to get rid of the dress but to clean it. If the stains are old and not a health risk, maybe he's being overly concerned. \n\nBut considering that it's his home, he has the right to ask for it to be cleaned. However, in a marriage, respecting each other's personal items is important. The wife might feel that the husband is being jealous or controlling. Since he claims not to be jealous, it's more about his personal discomfort. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is about health or just personal preference. If it's the latter, he might be in the right to ask, but the wife's right to have her memories could be respected by allowing her to keep it if she's willing to clean it. If she refuses to clean it despite his request, that's where the conflict arises. \n\nIn this case, the husband is not being jealous but is asking for a clean home. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his wishes. But maybe the husband should have communicated earlier if he was uncomfortable with the dress's condition. Since he didn't notice the stains until now, perhaps the situation is a bit new. \n\nOverall, the husband's request seems reasonable, and the wife's refusal might be more about sentiment over practicality. However, the wife's right to her memories is also valid. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, but the wife's refusal could stem from valid emotional reasons. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. But since the husband is asking for a reasonable action (cleaning) that doesn't affect the dress's existence, he might not be in the wrong. The wife's refusal could be the issue here. So the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
