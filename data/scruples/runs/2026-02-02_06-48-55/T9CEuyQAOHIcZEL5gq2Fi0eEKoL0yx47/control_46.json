I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never had an issue before. Then, after a friend's visit where the wife mentioned the stains, the husband brings up the issue. He wants the dress cleaned because of the biological stains. The wife is upset, says he's overreacting, and doesn't want to clean it because of her memories.\n\nSo, the main points are: The husband is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife feels he's being jealous and not respecting her past. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries. The husband has a right to his comfort in his own home. Even though the wife had sex with someone else in the past, the presence of bodily fluids might be a hygiene or emotional issue for the husband. However, the wife's right to keep a memento from her past is also valid. \n\nIs the husband overstepping by making a big deal about it now? He didn't have an issue before the friend mentioned it. Maybe he's reacting because of the friend's comment or his own feelings. But bodily fluids can be a health concern, especially if not cleaned properly. However, dry cleaning might remove the stains, so the husband's request is reasonable from a hygiene perspective. \n\nBut the wife argues that it's part of her memories. There's a conflict between his comfort and her sentimentality. They need to find a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the husband is making a reasonable request for cleanliness and his own comfort, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's being overly controlling or jealous, then he could be. The key here is that he's not upset about the affair itself but the physical remnants. Jealousy isn't the issue here; it's about the physical presence of another man's fluids. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have boundaries about past relationships. The husband's boundary is about not wanting the stains. The wife's boundary is about keeping her memories. Both have valid points. However, since the husband is asking for a reasonable action (dry cleaning), and the wife is refusing, it's a matter of negotiation. But the husband isn't wrong for having that request. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing a valid personal boundary regarding the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n"
