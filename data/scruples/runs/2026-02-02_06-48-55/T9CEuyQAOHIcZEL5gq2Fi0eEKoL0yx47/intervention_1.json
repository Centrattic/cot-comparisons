I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife has a prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. He wants her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's part of her memories.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's not jealous about her past partners in general, but this specific dress is causing him discomfort. The stain is from a past sexual encounter, and he's asking for it to be cleaned. His main issue seems to be about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Maybe he's concerned about health, cleanliness, or just the psychological aspect of having that in the house.\n\nNow, the wife's side: she's keeping the dress as a memory, even though it's stained. She doesn't want to clean it, which makes the husband feel like he's being told to accept something that makes him uncomfortable. She's using the argument that having good memories is enough, but the husband is clearly distressed by it. \n\nI need to think about boundaries and mutual respect in a marriage. If the husband is uncomfortable with the item in their home, does he have the right to ask for it to be removed or cleaned? On the other hand, is the wife justified in keeping a personal memento, even if it's not to her partner's liking?\n\nThe key here might be whether the husband is overreacting. The wife points out he never cared before, which is true. He didn't mind the dress being there until the stains were brought up. So maybe he is overreacting to a specific issue that wasn't an issue before. But the problem is that now it's causing him distress. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of privacy. The wife might feel that her personal memories are her own, and the husband shouldn't have a say in that. However, if the item is in their shared home, the husband might feel that he has the right to set boundaries about what's in their home. \n\nAlso, the fact that the wife's friend was present when the stain was mentioned could have made the husband feel embarrassed or that the situation was made public unnecessarily. The wife's comment about getting \"dirty in the limo\" might have been a provocative remark that triggered the husband's reaction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. However, the wife is defending her right to keep a personal item. If the husband's discomfort is genuine and the dress is in their shared space, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's being controlling or overstepping by dictating what she can keep, then he might be at fault. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. They might need to find a middle ground, like the wife moving the dress to a different location. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's asking her to clean it for his comfort, and she's refusing, maybe he's not wrong because it's his home and he has the right to feel comfortable. However, if the dress is part of her personal history, she might have a right to keep it. The fact that he didn't mind the dress itself but only the stain after it was brought up complicates things. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's asking for something that affects his own comfort in their shared home. But it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and based on the information given, I think he's not. So answer B.\n"
