I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife is upset because he suddenly cares now, even though she never mentioned the stains before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He says he's not jealous of her past partners, but this situation is about a physical object in their home that has bodily fluids from someone else. He's uncomfortable with that. It's about personal boundaries and what's acceptable in a shared living space. The wife, on the other hand, sees the dress as part of her memories and doesn't want to clean it, even though she's aware it's there.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband has the right to set boundaries in his own home. Even if he's not jealous, the presence of another person's bodily fluids might make him uneasy, and he's asking for a simple solution (dry cleaning) to address that discomfort. The wife, however, might feel that her personal memories shouldn't be disturbed unless it's a health issue. But the problem here isn't about health; it's about emotional discomfort. \n\nThe key points are consent and respect. The husband didn't know about the stains until now, so it wasn't a pre-existing issue. The wife didn't hide it before, but she also didn't clean it up when he expressed discomfort. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Dry cleaning is a standard solution for stains, and the husband is asking for it to remove the stains, not to erase her memories. \n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong with his request. Emotionally, the wife might feel that the husband is being controlling, but if he's not asking for the dress to be thrown away but just to be cleaned, it's a reasonable request. The wife's refusal might be seen as disrespectful to his feelings. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking for the dress to be cleaned. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
