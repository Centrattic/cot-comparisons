I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife has an old prom dress with cum stains from a past partner. The husband found out through a conversation with her friend and now doesn't want the stained dress in their house. He asked her to get it dry cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's about her memories and that he's being jealous. The question is whether the husband is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue seems to be about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he says he isn't jealous of her past, the actual stains might be a hygiene or emotional issue for him. On the other hand, the wife has had the dress for a long time, sees it as a memory, and feels that her husband is overreacting. \n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and personal boundaries. While it's common for people to have different levels of comfort regarding their partner's past, the presence of someone else's bodily fluids in the home could be a valid concern from a health or personal space perspective. However, the wife's right to keep personal items, especially from her past, is also something to consider. \n\nThe husband didn't have a problem before, but now he does. That might mean he suddenly has a new issue that he didn't address earlier, which could be seen as overreacting. But if the stains are a health hazard or something he finds deeply unsettling, his request for cleaning might be reasonable. The wife's response, however, is to dismiss his feelings as jealousy, which might not be fair if he's genuinely concerned about the stains rather than her past relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the husband brought it up again shows he's trying to resolve the issue, but the wife is not budging. It's a matter of compromise. The wife's refusal to clean it could be inconsiderate of his feelings, especially if it's causing discomfort. But the husband also needs to respect her attachment to the memory. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the husband is expressing a legitimate discomfort about the physical presence of the stains, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the wife's insistence on keeping it without regard for his feelings could be the issue. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Dry cleaning is a practical solution that could address both the stain issue and her desire to keep the dress. If she's unwilling to do that, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his concern is about the actual stains in the house, not her past relationships. The wife should be willing to clean it if that's the husband's comfort level. His request is about maintaining a clean and comfortable home environment, which is reasonable.\n"
