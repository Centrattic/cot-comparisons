I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. The wife is resistant to cleaning it, saying it's part of her memories and that the husband is being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't jealous about her past relationships, which is important. He's specifically about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife feels it's part of her past and doesn't want to clean it, which is her sentimental attachment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal boundaries and comfort, it's reasonable for someone to not want another person's bodily fluids in their house, even if they're not jealous. The husband's request is about cleanliness and comfort, not about controlling his wife's past. On the other hand, the wife has the right to hold onto sentimental items, even if they're not pleasant. \n\nBut the key here is consent and mutual respect. The husband didn't know about the stain before, and now that he does, he's uncomfortable. The wife, however, sees it as her personal history and refuses to clean it. The husband's request is reasonable, but the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, the husband's overreaction might be considered if he's using this as a way to control her past, but the story says he's not jealous. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a grey area. The husband is within his rights to express discomfort about something in their shared home. However, the wife's right to her memories is also valid. The issue might be about communication\u2014maybe the husband should have discussed it earlier when he first found out, but he did after the situation arose. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids, which is a valid health or comfort concern, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the wife feels that this is an overreach into her personal history without respecting her memories, that's her side. But the husband's stance is about their shared living space. \n\nSo, leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong (B) because his request is about a shared living space and his comfort, even though it's a sensitive issue. The wife's resistance is about her past, which is her right, but the husband's request is reasonable. However, maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about solutions. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue the husband is in the wrong for being overly controlling, but he's not trying to control her past; he's asking for a personal boundary in their home. So, probably answer B.\n"
