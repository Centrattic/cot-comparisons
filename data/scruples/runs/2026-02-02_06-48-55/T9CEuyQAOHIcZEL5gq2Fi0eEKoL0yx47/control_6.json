I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding their wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife are married, they met in college, and he's not jealous about her past. The wife had this prom dress she kept for years. The issue came up when her friend was over, and the wife mentioned the stains from her ex-date. The husband then expressed discomfort about the stains being in their home, asking her to get it cleaned. She refused, saying he's overreacting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, maybe not, but the question is about being in the wrong morally or in the relationship. The husband's main issue is not her having sex before but the stains in their home. He's not jealous of the past partner, just the physical remnants. The wife values the memories from that night and doesn't want to remove them. \n\nSo, whose needs are more important here? The husband's comfort in their shared home versus the wife's sentimental attachment. The husband is asking for a reasonable action (dry cleaning) to remove what he finds uncomfortable. The wife is resisting because it's part of her memory. \n\nBut is the husband entitled to his comfort? In a relationship, there's a balance. If the husband didn't mind her past, why this sudden issue? Maybe it's about the physical presence in their home. The wife might feel it's her right to keep personal items. However, the husband is the one living with the item now. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's expressing a valid discomfort about bodily fluids from another person in their home. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband isn't being jealous about her past, just about the current situation. So the answer is B, No.\n"
