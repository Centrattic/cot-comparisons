I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset about his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, still being in their house. The wife is resistant to getting it cleaned, invoking memories and not seeing it as a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author states he's not jealous about her past partners, but this specific issue is causing discomfort. The key points here are the author's personal boundaries and the wife's attachment to the memory. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's not upset about the sexual activity itself but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. This is about personal discomfort and hygiene, not jealousy. However, the wife sees it as a memory and is resisting because of that. \n\nIn relationships, personal boundaries are important. If one partner is uncomfortable with something, the other should ideally respect that unless there's a valid reason to push back. The wife's argument is about her memories, but the author's request is about the current living environment. \n\nI should also consider cultural and social norms. Some might see getting rid of a memory item as dismissive of the other's past, while others prioritize mutual respect for each other's feelings. The author isn't asking for the dress to be destroyed, just cleaned, which is a reasonable request if it's causing him distress. \n\nThe wife's reaction of \"don't be jealous\" might be dismissive, which could be hurtful. The author isn't being jealous about her past but about the current situation. The wife's refusal to clean it despite the author's discomfort could indicate a lack of respect for his feelings. \n\nHowever, the wife has the right to hold onto personal mementos. It's a balance between respecting each other's boundaries. If the author is okay with other aspects of her past but this specific item is an issue, it's valid for him to express that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's respecting her past but setting a boundary about his home, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's overreacting or being controlling, then he could be. The line here is whether his request is reasonable. Asking to clean the dress is a reasonable way to address the issue without destroying the dress. The wife's refusal might be the bigger issue here, but the author's request is justified if it's making him uncomfortable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he's expressing a valid boundary regarding his home environment. The wife, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for not respecting his request. But I need to be careful not to assume. The key is mutual respect. If the author can articulate his reasons without being dismissive of her memories, he's in the right. Since he's not asking for the dress's removal but just cleaning, it's a reasonable request.\n"
