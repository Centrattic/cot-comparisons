I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. The wife is keeping it, and he's upset about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The husband doesn't have an issue with his wife's past or her having relationships before marriage. The problem is specifically about the dress having cum stains from another guy. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's being jealous. The wife sees the dress as a memory, while the husband is uncomfortable with it.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal factors. In some cultures, keeping items with bodily fluids from past partners might be more common, but in others, it's seen as unsanitary or inappropriate. The husband's discomfort could be about cleanliness, but it's also about the emotional aspect\u2014having a physical reminder of his wife's past in their home. \n\nJealousy is mentioned, but the husband clarifies he's not jealous of her past partners. His issue is with the presence of another man's biological material in their house. That's a different angle. However, the wife might feel that his request is a form of control, especially if he's making it a big deal. \n\nCommunication is key here. They've had the discussion, and she's unwilling to comply. The husband might feel that his request is reasonable for their home's hygiene, but the wife values the dress as a personal memory. It becomes a matter of mutual respect. If the husband is uncomfortable, but the wife is not, whose feelings should take precedence?\n\nIt's possible that the husband is overstepping, especially if the dress is in her closet and not a public area. However, if the presence of the dress causes him distress, it's a valid concern. The wife's dismissal of his feelings (\"overreacting\") could be the real issue here. \n\nAlternatively, the husband might be projecting his own discomfort onto the situation. Maybe he's trying to assert control over his wife's personal items. But if the dress is in their shared home, he has a right to feel that their home should be a clean and comfortable space for both of them.\n\nI think the crux is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If the dress is in a private area and she's not using it, maybe it's her choice. But if the presence of the dress is causing him distress and affecting their relationship, then mutual compromise is needed. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his discomfort could indicate she's dismissing his feelings, which isn't respectful. On the other hand, the husband might be being overly controlling about something that's her personal history.\n\nIn the end, it's a complex situation. Both parties have valid points, but the wife's insistence on keeping the dress despite his discomfort might be the issue. However, the husband's approach could be seen as overreacting if the dress is a small part of their home. So, maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), but I need to be careful. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's asking for something reasonable\u2014like cleaning a stained item\u2014it's not his fault. The wife's refusal might be the problem. So, the answer might be B.\n"
