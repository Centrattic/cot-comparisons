I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his wife are married, and he's upset because her old prom dress has cum stains from a previous partner. The issue came up when she showed the dress to a friend, and the friend noticed the spots. The author then confronted her about wanting the dress cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting and not to be jealous. He's been upset since, and the dress is still in her closet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is married and has a problem with his wife's prom dress having stains from someone else. He's not jealous about her past partners in general, but specifically about the biological residue. His wife is keeping the dress as a memory, which she values emotionally. The author's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, not the act of her having sex with someone else.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries in his own home. If he's uncomfortable with the presence of another man's cum, that's a valid feeling. However, the wife has a right to her own memories and may view the dress as a personal item. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping if the dress is in her personal space (closet) and she hasn't previously been asked to remove it or clean it. But then again, if they are in a committed relationship, the author might have the right to express his discomfort about having someone else's bodily fluids in their shared home.\n\nAnother angle is about consent and shared living spaces. When they got married, the author might not have considered that his wife would keep such an item. But now that he's aware, is it reasonable to ask her to remove it or clean it? The wife might argue that it's her personal property and her right to keep it, even if it's uncomfortable for the husband. However, the presence of another person's bodily fluids could be a health concern or a matter of personal disgust, which is subjective.\n\nAlso, the wife laughed about the situation when showing the dress to a friend, which might imply she's not private about this aspect. The author might feel that by keeping the dress, she's not respecting his feelings now. The key here is whether the author's request for the dress to be cleaned is a reasonable boundary in their relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say that after marriage, keeping such a personal item from a past relationship could be seen as unnecessary, especially if it causes discomfort to the spouse. Others might argue that it's her right to have mementos unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nI should also consider if there's any historical context about the dress. The author mentions it's been in her closet forever, and he never thought about it before. The issue arose only after the friend's visit. So the problem is recent. The wife's reaction of \"you never cared before\" could indicate that the author is overreacting now, especially if there was no prior issue. However, his discomfort now is valid, even if it's a new realization.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author tried to talk to her, but she dismissed his concerns as jealousy. The wife's refusal to clean the dress might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. But the author's approach might be too direct, not considering her emotional attachment to the dress. Perhaps a compromise is needed, like moving the dress to a different location, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but his insistence on getting it cleaned without considering her feelings might be an overreaction. However, the wife's refusal to address his concern could also be problematic. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If he's asserting his boundaries in his own home, he might not be wrong. But if his request is unreasonable or disrespectful, then he could be in the wrong.\n\nI think the author's main point is about the presence of another man's bodily fluids, which is a personal boundary. Since the wife is keeping it in their home and not cleaning it, she might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundary. But if the author didn't set this boundary before and it's a new issue, maybe he's overreacting. However, the fact that the author is uncomfortable is his right, and he's trying to address it. The wife's dismissive attitude (\"don't be jealous\") might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. He's expressing a valid personal boundary. The wife's refusal to comply could be the issue, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
