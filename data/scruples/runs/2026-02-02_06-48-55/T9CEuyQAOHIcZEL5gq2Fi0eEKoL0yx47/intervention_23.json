I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners in general, but specifically about the physical reminder (the dress) in their home. The wife has had the dress for years, and the issue only arose when her friend commented on the stains. The husband then confronts her about it, leading to tension.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? From a traditional perspective, some might say he's being overly possessive or jealous, especially since he didn't mind her past. But others might argue that having another man's bodily fluids in the house is a hygiene and emotional issue. It's about personal boundaries. The husband is uncomfortable with the stains in their home, which is his right. The wife values the memories associated with the dress, which is also her right. \n\nIt's a conflict of values. The husband's discomfort is valid; he doesn't want something that symbolizes another man's presence in their home. The wife feels that the husband is overstepping by pressuring her to get it cleaned when she's happy with it. The question is whether his stance is unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The husband expressed his feelings, which is healthy. The wife, however, is dismissive, calling him jealous. But maybe the issue isn't jealousy per se, but about shared space and what each partner is comfortable with. The husband isn't objecting to her past, but to the physical item in their home. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It depends on perspective. If the dress was a cherished memory for her but a discomfort for him, perhaps a middle ground is needed. However, the husband is within his rights to request that something he finds unpleasant be removed or cleaned. The wife's refusal might be the issue here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is being too controlling by making the dress a point of contention. The wife might feel that her personal history is being invalidated. But again, the husband's discomfort is about their shared living space. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The husband isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way, but the way he's handling it (insisting on cleaning) might be causing more conflict than necessary. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since both have valid perspectives, it's a 50/50. But the user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on societal norms. In many cases, people might side with the husband here, considering the physical presence of someone else's bodily fluids in the home as a reasonable concern. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
