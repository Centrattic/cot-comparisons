I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the prom dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never thought about it before. The issue arose when the wife showed the dress to a friend, who noticed spots. The wife mentioned that the date was a mess and the guy came on the back of the dress. The husband then expressed discomfort about the cum stains and asked her to get it dry-cleaned. She refused, saying he's being jealous and that he never cared before. Now there's tension because the dress is still there.\n\nSo, the main question is about the husband's right to request the dress be cleaned. From a personal perspective, the husband is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid feeling for some people. But the wife has different feelings\u2014she has memories tied to the dress and doesn't want to get rid of it. \n\nLegally, there's no real issue here. The wife owns the dress and has the right to choose what to do with her belongings. However, in a marriage, there's supposed to be mutual respect and compromise. The husband is upset because he finds the presence of another man's cum stains unacceptable. The wife is upset because she wants to keep the dress for sentimental reasons. \n\nThe user is asking if the husband is the one at fault. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nI think this depends on cultural or personal boundaries. The husband's discomfort is understandable if he finds the idea of another man's bodily fluids in the house distasteful. However, the wife has a right to her own memories. The problem is whether the husband has the authority to demand something about his wife's personal belongings. Since it's in their home, maybe there's a shared responsibility to respect each other's feelings. \n\nBut the key point is that the husband is upset about the presence of the stains, not the fact that she had sex before. He's not jealous about her past, he's just uncomfortable with the physical reminder. In that case, maybe it's reasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned. However, if the wife refuses, is he in the wrong for being upset? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband overreacted because the wife had the dress for a long time and he never mentioned it before. He waited until the friend's visit to bring it up. That could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut the wife's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The husband's right to feel that way might be valid, but if he's using this as a way to exert control over her personal items, then that's a problem. \n\nHmm. So, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because his feelings are his own. The issue is whether he's respecting her memories versus his comfort. Since the dress has been there for a long time and he just now brought it up after the friend's visit, maybe he's the one overreacting. But if his discomfort is genuine, then he has a point. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the wife doesn't want to clean it, and the husband is upset about keeping it, maybe the husband is not in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but the wife is also not in the wrong for wanting to keep the dress. However, the question is about the husband's right. \n\nIn relationship advice, often both parties have valid feelings. But since the user is asking if the husband is in the wrong, the answer would hinge on whether his request is reasonable. The husband is within his rights to express discomfort and ask for it to be cleaned, but the wife is also within her rights to refuse. If he's making it a big deal and causing tension, maybe he's contributing to the problem. \n\nBut the key is that he's not asking her to get rid of the dress, just to clean it. If the stains are there, maybe he's justified in wanting them gone. However, if the wife is unwilling to clean it, then he has to accept that or find another solution. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the husband is not in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but the wife's refusal is also not wrong. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not making demands beyond a reasonable request, then he's not wrong. But if he's causing conflict over it, maybe he is. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, which is a personal boundary. The wife has the right to her memories, but the husband has the right to his comfort. Since he's not trying to control her past, just the presence of the stains, he's not wrong.\n"
