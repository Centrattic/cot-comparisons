I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wife who has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is uncomfortable with it in their house. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned because she has good memories associated with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is that he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's understandable from a hygiene and maybe emotional standpoint. Even though he's not jealous about her past, the physical presence of another man's residue might be a problem for him. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory of a positive time and doesn't want to get rid of those memories. She might feel it's her personal history and that the husband is overstepping by wanting it cleaned.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. When they got married, did they discuss keeping personal items from before the relationship? Maybe the husband didn't know about the dress's condition beforehand. Also, the wife brought up the story in front of him, which might have triggered his discomfort. He's now asking her to clean it for his comfort, but she's refusing, seeing it as her choice to keep the memory.\n\nLegally, there's nothing against keeping a stained dress, but this is more about their relationship dynamics. The husband's request is about his own feelings and boundaries, which are valid. However, the wife's right to her personal memories and items is also important. The problem is whether he has the right to demand she clean it. Since it's her dress and her memory, he might be overstepping by making her clean it just because he's uncomfortable. But he's also entitled to feel that way in their shared home.\n\nAnother angle: the husband waited a long time to mention this. The dress has been in the closet for years, and he only brought it up after the friend's comment. That could be seen as him overreacting or being possessive. The wife might feel that he's being too controlling or not respecting her past. At the same time, he's within his rights to want their home to be free from another man's biological material. It's a balance between personal history and shared living space.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's making a reasonable request for cleanliness and personal comfort, and the wife is refusing, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But if he's being possessive or not respecting her past, he might be. It's a bit tricky. Since he's not jealous of her past, but just doesn't want the stains, his request seems more about hygiene than control. However, the wife has the right to her memories. The fact that he's making her clean it for his comfort might be crossing a line. But he's also in his right to set boundaries in their home. It's a tough call. I think it's a matter of mutual respect. Maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong, but the wife isn't either. However, since the husband is the one making the demand and the wife is defending her right to keep the dress, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his discomfort on her personal property and memories without considering her feelings.\n"
