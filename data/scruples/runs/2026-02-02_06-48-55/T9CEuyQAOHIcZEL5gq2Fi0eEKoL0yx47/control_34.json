I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe scenario is about a married couple where the wife has an old prom dress with \"cum stains\" from her past. The husband is now uncomfortable with it being in their house. They met in college, and he's not jealous about her past partners. The issue came up when her friend was over, and the wife showed the dress, mentioning that her date was a mess. The husband later confronted her about the stains and wants it cleaned. The wife thinks he's overreacting and doesn't want to clean it. Now they're having awkwardness because of this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's perspective. He's married to her now, and even though he's not jealous about her past, the idea of another man's bodily fluids being in their home is making him uncomfortable. That's a personal boundary issue. Maybe he feels that since they're married, keeping such items is inappropriate. It's his home, and he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. But is it his place to make that decision? Or is it the wife's right to keep her personal memories?\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has good memories associated with the dress. She's had it in her closet for a long time, and the husband never had an issue before. She might see the dress as a part of her history and personal memories. Her friend was even shown the dress, indicating that she's not shy about it. The husband's sudden concern might seem like an overreaction from her point of view, especially since he had no problem before.\n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not jealous about her past, then his issue isn't with her past but with the physical presence of those memories in their home. It's a matter of personal comfort. But does that make him wrong? Or is it a valid concern?\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. If the husband is uncomfortable with the stain, he has a right to express that. However, the wife also has the right to keep her personal items unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. The husband's request is about cleanliness and his comfort, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal is about her memories and personal history. \n\nBut here's a nuance: the dress is a physical object that could be cleaned. If the husband wants it cleaned, it's a practical solution. The wife refuses, which might be because she doesn't want to erase the memory. However, the husband might not care about the memory but just about the actual stain. If cleaning removes the stain, then it's a way to respect both parties' needs. But if the stain is part of the memory for her, maybe she doesn't want it cleaned. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? It depends on whether the stain is a health or cleanliness issue. If it's just a stain that's gross to him, it's a personal preference. But if it's a health concern, that's different. Since the stain is from bodily fluids, maybe there's a health aspect too, though that's not mentioned here. \n\nAlso, the wife showing the dress to her friend and making a joke about it in front of the husband might have triggered the husband's discomfort. The husband's reaction might not just be about the stain but also about the public display of that memory. However, the wife's actions were in front of her friend, not necessarily violating privacy. \n\nIn terms of wrong-doing, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. He's voicing a boundary. The wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep the dress. The problem is that they didn't communicate this before, and it's causing conflict now. The husband's new stance might feel abrupt to her, leading to her thinking he's overreacting. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned. His request is about his comfort in his own home. The wife isn't wrong for wanting to keep it as a memory. However, the husband's approach might be causing the conflict. Maybe a better approach is discussing it calmly rather than making it an \"AITA\" situation. But in terms of right or wrong, both have valid points, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong for stating his preference.\n"
