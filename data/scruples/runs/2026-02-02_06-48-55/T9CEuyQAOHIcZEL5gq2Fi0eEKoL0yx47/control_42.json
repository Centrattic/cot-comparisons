I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from her ex, and he wants her to get it cleaned, but she's refusing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, which is important. However, the issue is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even if he's not jealous, maybe he's uncomfortable with the idea of that in the house now that they're married. \n\nThe wife is holding onto the dress for sentimental reasons, saying she has good memories associated with it. She's also making a joke about having \"gotten dirty in the limo\" with the husband, which might be trying to make light of the situation. But the husband's main point is about the stain itself\u2014not the emotional attachment, but the actual presence of another man's cum in the house. \n\nFrom a health and hygiene perspective, having bodily fluids around could be a concern. Even if it's an old dress, some people might find it gross. However, others might see it as a personal memory and not a big deal once the relationship is past. \n\nThe wife's response is that she doesn't want to clean it and that the husband is overreacting. She's also pointing out that he never cared before, implying that this is a new issue. The husband is trying to communicate his discomfort now, though. \n\nMarital relationships involve compromise. The husband is asserting his boundaries, which is valid. But the wife is also entitled to her feelings about the dress. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. If he's not jealous but just wants the stain out of the house, that's more about personal preference and boundaries rather than jealousy. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that he's intruding on her personal memories by asking her to remove the stain. It's a conflict between his comfort and her sentimental value. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might side with the husband, thinking that after marriage, it's reasonable to want to remove any remnants of past relationships. Others might think the wife is right to keep her memories, even if it's uncomfortable now. \n\nBut the key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for making this request. If he's not being jealous but is simply stating his personal boundaries, then he's not in the wrong. The problem might be that the wife is dismissing his feelings as jealousy when he's not actually being jealous. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort with another person's bodily fluids in the home, which is a valid concern regardless of his feelings towards her past. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
