I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband being upset that his wife's old prom dress has stains from another guy's semen. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue seems to be about the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He mentions he's not jealous of her past partners, so it's not about jealousy per se. It's more about physical discomfort or disgust with the idea of that stain being there. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories attached to the dress and feels he's overreacting. She might see it as a personal and nostalgic item, and his request to clean it feels like an intrusion or dismissal of her feelings.\n\nNow, I should think about societal norms and personal boundaries. In many relationships, it's common for partners to have differing comfort levels about past items. The husband's request is about removing a specific item that he finds unsettling. But the wife's refusal could be seen as respecting her emotional connection to the item. However, the husband is living in the same house, so his comfort in their shared space is also a factor.\n\nIs there a clear wrong here? Maybe not. The husband's reaction is about his own feelings of disgust, which is valid. But the wife has the right to keep items that are meaningful to her unless they cause a health issue or are illegal. Since the stain isn't a health hazard, forcing her to clean it might be overstepping. However, the husband is within his rights to express discomfort in his own home.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The husband tried to address it, and the wife didn't budge. The husband might need to find a compromise, like her storing the dress elsewhere or using a protective covering. But from a right/wrong perspective, both have valid points. However, since the stain isn't harmful, the husband's demand might be seen as overreacting, making him the one in the wrong. Alternatively, if the presence of the stain is causing him distress, he might not be wrong for seeking a resolution. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the husband's stance is more about personal boundaries, and if the wife refuses to accommodate, he's not entirely in the wrong. But maybe the wife's emotional attachment is more important here. Hmm.\n"
