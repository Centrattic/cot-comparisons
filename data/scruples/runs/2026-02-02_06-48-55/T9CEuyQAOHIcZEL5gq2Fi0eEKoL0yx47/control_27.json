I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. They've been married for a while, but this came up when the wife showed the dress to a friend, mentioning the stains.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is uncomfortable with the physical remains of another man's presence in their home. Even though he's not jealous of her past, the actual biological material might be a modern issue that wasn't a concern in the past. On the other hand, the wife sees it as a memory and doesn't want to clean it, possibly seeing it as part of her history.\n\nMarital boundaries are important. The husband has a right to his comfort in their shared home. However, the wife's feelings about her memories are also valid. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Cum stains aren't just memories; they can be cleaned, and having another person's bodily fluids in the house might be a health or cleanliness issue. The wife's refusal might stem from emotional attachment, but the husband's discomfort is about the physical presence, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nJealousy isn't the main issue here; he's not upset about her past partners but the current presence of the stains. The wife's reaction of \"you never cared before\" might be a defense mechanism. The husband bringing it up now could be about setting boundaries for their current life together. The fact that they're still married suggests the issue isn't about infidelity but about how they handle shared spaces and past memories.\n\nPossible angles: The husband isn't wrong for setting a boundary about what's in their home. The wife isn't wrong for valuing her memories. But the husband's request is reasonable if it's affecting his comfort. The wife's refusal might be overstepping if she's not considering his feelings now. However, the husband could also approach it with more empathy, understanding her attachment.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see the husband as overreacting, while others support his right to a clean home. But the key is whether his request is valid. Since the stain can be removed, the husband's stance is about maintaining a standard in their home. The wife's refusal might be inconsiderate if she's aware of his discomfort. But she's also not wrong for having her own feelings. However, in a relationship, both partners need to accommodate each other's needs. If he's made his feelings known and she's not willing to comply, that's a problem. So the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking her to clean it. The wife's refusal might be the issue here.\n"
