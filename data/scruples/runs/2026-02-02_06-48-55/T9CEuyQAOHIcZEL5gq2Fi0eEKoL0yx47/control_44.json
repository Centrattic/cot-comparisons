I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. The wife is upset that he's overreacting and not letting her keep the dress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous of her past, but the physical presence of the stains is an issue. The wife feels the dress is part of her memories and doesn't want to get it cleaned because of the sentimental value.\n\nLegally, there's no law against keeping a dress with stains, but this is a personal and emotional issue. The husband's discomfort is about his personal boundaries and cleanliness. The wife's stance is on her autonomy over her personal items and memories. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, and the wife dismissed them as jealousy, even though he clarified it's not about past relationships. The problem is that the husband's comfort in his own home is being affected. The wife's refusal to compromise might be seen as not respecting his feelings, but she's also asserting her right to keep her memories.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and setting a boundary. He's not being controlling unless he's demanding she remove all memories of past relationships. Since he's okay with the fact she had sex before but not the physical presence of the stains, it's more about his own comfort. The wife, however, is not respecting his boundary by refusing to clean it. But maybe that's her choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, the husband is within his rights to ask for the stains to be removed for his comfort. The wife is within her rights to refuse if it's her personal item. But in a shared home, both need to consider each other's feelings. If the husband is the one living with the stains, he has a valid point. The wife's dismissal of his feelings as jealousy might be the real issue here, even if she's not wrong to keep the dress. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort and setting a boundary. But some might argue that the wife's right to her personal items and memories is more important. However, since the husband is the one living in the house and the presence of the stains is affecting his comfort, he's not wrong for wanting it cleaned.\n"
