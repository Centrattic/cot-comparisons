I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, but now the dress is an issue. The wife is upset because he's overreacting and she has good memories connected to the dress. The husband is uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in their home, even if it's from years ago.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a discomfort that's personal. Jealousy usually comes from insecurity, but he says he's not jealous. His issue is with the physical presence of another man's stains. That's a matter of personal boundaries and cleanliness. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to part with it or clean it. \n\nIt's a conflict of personal preferences. The husband's request is about maintaining a clean home, which is reasonable. The wife's stance is about preserving her memories. Since they're married, they should ideally communicate and find a compromise. But the question is about whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of rights, neither is objectively wrong. The husband has a right to his comfort in their home, and the wife has a right to her personal items and memories. However, since they are in a committed relationship, both should respect each other's feelings. The husband's request is reasonable, but the wife's refusal is also valid from her perspective. \n\nBut the key here is the presence of bodily fluids. If the husband is concerned about health or cleanliness, that's a valid concern. However, the wife might not see it the same way. If they can't resolve it, maybe the husband is overstepping by making it a demand, but his concern is understandable. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn relationship advice, often the emphasis is on communication and compromise. Since the husband has brought it up multiple times and the wife refuses, perhaps the husband is justified in his feelings. However, the wife's emotional attachment to the dress is also real. So it's a tough call. \n\nBut according to the options given, A is the author is in the wrong, B is not. Based on the analysis, the husband isn't necessarily wrong to want the dress cleaned for cleanliness reasons, but the wife isn't wrong to hold onto her memories. However, since the question is about the author's wrongness, and his actions are driven by personal discomfort, not jealousy, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
