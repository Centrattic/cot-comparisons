I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with cum stains in their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife hasn't had the dress cleaned for years, and even laughed about the stains. The husband only got upset after hearing the story. He's asking if he's at fault for not wanting that in the house now. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The wife has a right to her memories, right? She might see the dress as a sentimental item from her past. On the other hand, the husband is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even if he's not jealous of her past, the physical presence of the stains is a new issue. \n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and communication. The husband's discomfort is valid, but he waited a long time to bring it up. Maybe he could have discussed it earlier instead of getting upset after the fact. However, the wife's response was dismissive, telling him not to be jealous, which might not address his actual concern about the stains. \n\nIs it about jealousy or cleanliness? The husband says he's not jealous, just doesn't want the stains. The wife's actions of showing the dress to a friend and making a joke about it might have made it more of an issue for him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe both have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband is expressing a legitimate discomfort and the wife isn't respecting his feelings, maybe he's not wrong. But if he waited too long to bring it up, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nHmm. The key points: The husband's request is reasonable (cleaning the dress), and the wife's refusal is dismissive. But the husband's timing and approach might matter. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong. I need to decide based on typical perspectives.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes bringing up old stuff can be seen as overreacting. But if the husband made it clear he doesn't want it in the house, and she's ignoring that, maybe she's the one being inconsiderate. But the husband's stance on not wanting the stains is about cleanliness and boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries about something in his home. The wife is being dismissive, so he's justified in wanting the stains cleaned. The problem is their communication and compromise. The husband isn't wrong for not wanting that in their house. So the answer is B.\n"
