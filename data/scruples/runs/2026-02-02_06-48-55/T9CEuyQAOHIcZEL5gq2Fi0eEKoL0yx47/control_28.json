I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is upset about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He doesn't care about the past relationship but wants it cleaned because it's in their current home. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories attached to the dress and doesn't want to get rid of them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the husband's feelings are valid. It's his home, and he's not comfortable with that. Jealousy isn't the issue here since he's not upset about the relationship itself, just the physical reminder. The wife, though, values her past memories. However, the presence of bodily fluids might be a health or cleanliness concern. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The husband's request is about maintaining his own comfort in their home. The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissing his feelings. But is he wrong for asking her to clean it? Personal boundaries are important. If the husband feels violated by the presence of someone else's biological material, he has a right to ask it to be cleaned. The wife's right to her memories is important, but maybe not more so than the husband's right to a clean home. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is overreacting because he's being overly controlling. But the wife chose to showcase the dress and joke about it in front of him, which might have triggered his reaction. \n\nI think the key here is that the husband isn't being jealous about the past but about the current presence of something he finds objectionable. The wife isn't wrong for valuing her memories, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting it removed. However, the answer depends on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not asking her to erase the memory just to clean the actual stains, it's a health/sanitation issue. So he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
