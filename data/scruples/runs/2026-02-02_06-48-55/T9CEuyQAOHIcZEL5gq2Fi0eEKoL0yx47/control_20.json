I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's being jealous. They're both married now, and he's not necessarily jealous of her past but doesn't want the stains in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a hygiene and personal boundary issue for him. He's not upset about her past relationships but the physical remnants. On the other hand, the wife values the dress as a memory from her past and doesn't see the stains as a problem. She might feel that his request is about control or jealousy, even if he says it's not.\n\nMarriage often involves compromise. The husband is setting a boundary he's uncomfortable with, which is his right. However, the wife is also within her rights to keep a personal item that holds sentimental value. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The husband didn't object before; maybe he should consider why it's an issue now. But his discomfort is valid. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as dismissing his feelings, but she's also protecting her own memories.\n\nIs he in the wrong for not wanting that in their home? Or is she wrong for refusing to clean it despite his request? It's a bit of a gray area. But since he's not jealous of her past and is clear about his boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is their communication and finding a solution that respects both their feelings. Maybe a middle ground, like dry cleaning as he suggested, would be ideal. Since the wife refuses, it's a conflict of values. The husband is asserting his comfort, which is reasonable. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
