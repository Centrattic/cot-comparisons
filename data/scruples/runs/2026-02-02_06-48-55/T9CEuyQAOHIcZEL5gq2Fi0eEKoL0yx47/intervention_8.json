I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband isn't jealous about his wife's past partners in general. The issue arose when a friend commented on the stains, revealing that the previous date was messy. The husband then told his wife to get the dress cleaned because he's uncomfortable with another man's cum in their home. The wife is upset, says he's overreacting, and refuses to clean it. The husband still wants it cleaned, and the wife calls him jealous.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In a marriage, both partners have different boundaries. The husband's discomfort might stem from personal hygiene or emotional reasons. The wife sees it as part of her memories and thinks he's being jealous, which he denies. \n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's objecting to something in their shared home. He's not upset about her past but the presence of another's bodily fluids. Legally, he's not wrong, but emotionally, it's a conflict. The wife's right to keep personal items vs. the husband's comfort at home. \n\nJealousy typically relates to current situations, but the husband says he's not jealous. However, bringing up past relationships in a way that causes discomfort can create tension. The wife might feel her autonomy is being challenged. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband's request is about cleaning the dress, not about her memories. But the wife feels it's an intrusion. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whose needs are more valid. Some might say the husband has a right to his comfort, others might say the wife's memories are hers to respect. \n\nThe line between personal boundaries and overstepping can be blurry. If the husband is making a reasonable request without malice, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being controlling, that's different. Here, he's asking to clean it, not remove it. The wife's refusal to listen could be part of the problem too. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate discomfort in their home. However, the wife's feelings about her memories are also valid. The answer might depend on cultural context and relationship values.\n"
