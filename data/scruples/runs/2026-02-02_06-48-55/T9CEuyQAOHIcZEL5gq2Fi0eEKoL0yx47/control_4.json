I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and she's attached to it because of the memories. She might see it as part of her past and not something that should be an issue in their marriage now. The friend's comment about the stains and the wife's reaction suggest that she's not hiding it and maybe even finds it amusing or a shared joke between her and the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous of her past partners per se, but the physical evidence of a past sexual encounter is making him uneasy. The key point here is about personal comfort and boundaries. The husband has a right to feel uncomfortable with something in his own home, even if it's a memento from his wife's past.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations in relationships. It's common for couples to have differing views on how to handle each other's past. Some might see the husband's request as reasonable, especially if he's not comfortable with the physical remnants of her past in their shared space. Others might argue that the wife has a right to keep her personal mementos, provided they don't infringe on his well-being.\n\nThe wife's response that he's overreacting and being jealous could be a point of contention. If she dismisses his feelings without acknowledging his discomfort, that might contribute to the tension. However, the husband is also asserting his boundaries here, which is important in a healthy relationship. Communication is key, and both need to find a middle ground.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against keeping a prom dress with stains. However, in the context of their relationship, the husband's discomfort is valid. The question is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not asking her to erase her past but to clean something she keeps in their home, it's a matter of mutual respect and compromise.\n\nPotential solutions could involve the wife cleaning the dress to respect his feelings, or they might agree on a compromise where the dress is stored elsewhere if cleaning isn't feasible. The fact that the husband brought it up again shows he's concerned and wants a resolution, which is mature. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as prioritizing her own feelings over his comfort, which could tip the balance in the husband's favor.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and requesting the dress be cleaned. The wife's attachment to the dress is valid, but the husband's right to a comfortable living environment should also be considered. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
