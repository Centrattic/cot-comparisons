I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the issue only came up when the friend commented on the spots. The author of the story said he's not jealous about her past partners but now he's uncomfortable with the stains. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is upset about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, not the emotional aspect of the past relationship. Jealousy is about emotional insecurity, but here it's more about cleanliness and maybe boundaries. \n\nThe wife has good memories attached to the dress and doesn't want to get it cleaned. She laughs about the incident, which might indicate she's not taking her husband's discomfort seriously. The problem is the ongoing tension between their perspectives. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's request seems valid if he's uncomfortable. However, the wife's right to keep mementos of her past is also a factor. The key is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not asking her to erase the memories but to clean the stains (which is a practical solution), maybe he's not wrong. But if the wife is unwilling to compromise, that's her choice.\n\nThe husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids, which can be a hygiene concern. Even if he's not jealous of the past, the current situation affects their living space. So, he's justified in wanting it cleaned. The wife's refusal might be where the problem lies, not the husband's request. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
