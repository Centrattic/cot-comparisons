I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple where the wife has a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner. The husband is uncomfortable keeping it in their home and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, calling him jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband says he's not jealous of her past, which is important. He's not upset about her past relationships or the act itself, but specifically about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and the sentimental aspect.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and compromise. The husband has a right to feel uncomfortable with what he perceives as a personal item that belongs to someone else (the ex's semen) in their shared living space. However, the wife's perspective is about her memories and her autonomy over her own belongings. \n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal boundaries and comfort in a shared home, it's reasonable for him to want it removed. But marriage also requires consideration of each other's feelings. The wife's refusal might stem from her valuing her past experiences, which are part of her identity. \n\nI need to weigh these aspects. The husband isn't being controlling about her past, just about an object in their home. The wife might feel that her personal items are her own, but the home is a shared space. There's also the aspect of communication. The husband brought it up, but the wife sees it as jealousy, which could be a misunderstanding. \n\nIn similar situations, people often resolve this through compromise. But the question is about who is in the wrong. If the husband's request is reasonable (wanting his house to be free of another person's biological material), then he's not wrong. However, if the wife's attachment to the dress is valid, then he might be overstepping. \n\nBut given that the husband isn't objecting to her past relationships, just the physical presence of someone else's stuff in their home, I lean towards him not being in the wrong. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his discomfort, even if her reasons are personal. However, it's a sensitive area in a marriage. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
