I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man being upset about his wife's old prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The author (the husband) is not jealous about her past relationships, but this specific incident with the dress is making him uncomfortable. The wife, on the other hand, wants to keep the dress as a memory and refuses to clean it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The husband's main issue isn't the fact that she had sex before, but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not jealous of her past partners but is unsettled by the physical remnants. The wife, however, views the dress as a cherished memory and resents his reaction, which she perceives as jealousy.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The husband expressed his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it, calling him overreacting. The husband feels that his request (to clean the dress) is reasonable given it's their home. The wife's refusal might stem from her emotional attachment to the memory, which she sees as part of her past. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries, there's a line between respecting a partner's past and personal discomfort. The husband's request is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids, which is a common concern. However, the wife has every right to hold onto memories, even if they involve her ex-partner. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but genuinely uncomfortable with the stains, his stance could be seen as reasonable. However, if his issue is more about control or trying to dictate her emotional attachments, then he might be overstepping. The wife's refusal to clean it could be her asserting her autonomy, which is also valid. \n\nBut the key here is that the husband isn't objecting to her past relationships but the physical presence of a previous partner's bodily fluids. That's a matter of personal comfort. However, the wife's right to keep her memories is also a valid point. There's a balance here. If the husband's request is reasonable (like cleaning the dress for hygiene reasons), but the wife is not willing to comply, maybe the issue is about respecting her memories. Alternatively, if the husband's discomfort is irrational or based on unnecessary anxiety, then he might be the one overreacting.\n\nIn this case, the husband is asking to clean the dress for his own comfort, which is a valid request. The wife's refusal is her right. However, if the husband is making her feel guilty about her past or trying to control her personal items, that's a problem. But the husband's stated reason is about not wanting the stains in their house, not about her being unfaithful or anything else. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether removing the stains is a reasonable request. Since the dress is in their home, the husband has a right to request that it be cleaned if it's causing him distress. However, the wife has the right to her memories. If the stains are a health concern, that's different, but if it's more about emotional discomfort, it's a personal issue. The husband isn't wrong for not wanting the stains, but he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to erase her past. However, since he's asking for cleaning (which removes the stains without destroying the dress), it's a middle ground. The wife's refusal could be seen as her right to her own memories, so the husband might not be in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife's refusal is also her right. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is not being jealous but is simply requesting removal of a physical item that makes him uncomfortable, he's not wrong. However, if his request is about controlling her past or making her feel guilty, then he's wrong. The scenario indicates he's not jealous, just uncomfortable with the stains. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
