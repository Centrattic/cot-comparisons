I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband who's upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. The wife is keeping it, and the husband wants it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners but is specifically uncomfortable with the biological material in their home. The wife feels the dress is a memory and refuses to clean it. The husband is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting that in the house.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, boundaries are important. The husband is expressing a boundary about what he's comfortable with in their shared living space. Even if the wife doesn't mind the memory, the husband is concerned about health or personal discomfort. It's about mutual respect. But does that make him wrong? Or is the wife wrong for not respecting his feelings?\n\nThere's no legal aspect here, but emotionally, both sides have valid points. The wife might feel her right to keep a memento is important, while the husband's right to a comfortable home is also valid. The question is whether his stance is unreasonable. Since he's not objecting to her past but the physical presence of the stains, it's a specific concern. Some might argue that if they're married and past relationships are accepted, then this is a minor issue. Others might say it's reasonable to ask for something that's unhygienic or makes him uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction of calling him jealous and overreacting could be undermining his valid concern. If he's not jealous but just wants it cleaned for health reasons, her framing it as jealousy might not be fair. But if the husband is being overly controlling or if the dress is a significant memory for her, that's another angle.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often keep mementos from their past, but the presence of bodily fluids might be a health concern. However, unless it's a health hazard, it's more of a personal preference. The husband's request for cleaning might be reasonable, but the wife is refusing, which could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's respectful and just wants it cleaned without being controlling, maybe not. But if he's being inflexible and causing conflict over something she feels is important, maybe. The key is whether his demand is reasonable. Since he's not asking for her to remove the dress entirely but just to clean it, it's a reasonable request. The wife's refusal despite his comfort being a factor might make her the one in the wrong. But the husband's insistence could also be seen as overstepping if the dress is her personal property and the stains are not a health risk.\n\nHmm. I think the answer depends on whether the husband's request is about health or discomfort versus the wife's right to her memories. If it's a health issue, he's in the right. If it's just personal discomfort, maybe not. But since the husband is stating he doesn't care about the sex but the stains, it's about the physical presence. In that case, he's not in the wrong for wanting it cleaned. The wife is in the wrong for refusing to accommodate his request unless it's a significant memory for her. But maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
