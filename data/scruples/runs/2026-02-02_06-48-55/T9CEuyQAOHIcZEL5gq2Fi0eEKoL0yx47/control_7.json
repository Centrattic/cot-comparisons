I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author being upset about his wife's prom dress having cum stains from a past partner. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's issue isn't about jealousy over past relationships, which he's stated he's not jealous about. His main problem is the presence of bodily fluids from someone else in their home. That seems like a legitimate hygiene concern. Even if the wife has good memories, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable with that. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not respecting her past. She might view the dress as a personal item tied to her memories. However, since they are married, sharing a home, there's a mutual responsibility to consider each other's comfort. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to get rid of the dress, just to clean it to remove bodily fluids. That's a basic health and cleanliness issue. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. But maybe there's a communication issue here. The author might need to express his feelings without making her feel attacked, and the wife needs to acknowledge his concerns even if she has her own about the memories. \n\nBut the core issue is the presence of another person's bodily fluids. That's a matter of personal boundaries and health. The author isn't wrong to want that cleaned. The wife's stance that she won't clean it because of her memories doesn't outweigh the author's right to a clean home. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
