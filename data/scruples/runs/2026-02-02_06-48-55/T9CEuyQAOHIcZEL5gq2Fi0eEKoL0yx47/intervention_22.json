I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past partner. He's upset and wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting and not to be jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a reasonable concern for some people. On the other hand, the wife is holding onto a dress with sentimental value from her past. She doesn't see the issue and thinks the author is being jealous. \n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and boundaries. The author isn't objecting to her past relationships, just the physical remnants. However, the wife values the memories, even if they include someone else's presence. The author's request is about cleanliness and comfort, which is valid, but the wife's refusal might stem from her emotional attachment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author brought it up, and she dismissed his feelings as jealousy. Maybe there's a deeper issue about trust or insecurity. But the author's stance isn't about her past but about their shared home's cleanliness. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he expressed his discomfort and asked for a solution. The wife's refusal could indicate she's not respecting his feelings. Alternatively, maybe the author is overreacting because it's an old dress she no longer uses. However, personal boundaries about having other people's bodily fluids in the home are subjective. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and wanting it cleaned. The wife isn't in the wrong for valuing her memories. But since he's the one initiating the conflict by wanting it cleaned and she's the one resisting, maybe the fault isn't entirely on either side. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the person who started the conflict. Since the author is the one bringing it up and the wife is not respecting his request, maybe the author is justified. But if the wife isn't violating any boundaries, perhaps the author is overstepping. \n\nWait, the wife didn't know the author would find out. She was just showing her friend the dress. The author's issue is about the presence of another's bodily fluids in their home. It's a matter of personal comfort. In that case, the author isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned, but the wife isn't wrong for not wanting to. However, the wife's refusal without considering his feelings might make her at fault. But since the question is about the author's fault, the answer would be B (No), as he's not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and requesting a clean home. The wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his request.\n"
