I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding their wife's prom dress with another man's stains. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is uncomfortable having a dress stained with another man's semen in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and refuses to clean it. The husband isn't jealous about her past, just the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared space.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. The husband's discomfort is about hygiene and personal space, not jealousy about her past. The wife, however, sees the dress as a memory, which she's entitled to. But the husband is the one who owns the house, so his right to his own space might come into play. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some might argue that the husband is overreacting, others might see his stance as reasonable. The wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as dismissing his feelings. However, the husband's reaction is about the physical presence of stains, not her past actions. \n\nLegally, there's no right or wrong here, but in terms of relationship dynamics, both have valid points. The husband's request is about his comfort in his own home, while the wife's request is about preserving a personal memory. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for not wanting something in his home that he finds offensive.\n\nI think the answer depends on mutual respect and communication. If the husband communicated his feelings without being judgmental about her past, and the wife is unwilling to compromise, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his reaction is based on control or insecurity, then he might be. The scenario doesn't show him being controlling, just expressing a personal boundary.\n"
