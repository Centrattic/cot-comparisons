I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is upset about his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying it's part of her memories and he shouldn't be jealous. They're both 41, married, and he's not usually jealous about her past. The issue here is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. \n\nNow, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's argument is about comfort and the idea of another man's biological material in their home. On the other hand, the wife sees it as a cherished memory from her past. \n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's not upset about the sexual activity itself\u2014his main issue is the physical stains. But cum is a bodily fluid, and some people might find it gross to have in their home. However, the wife's right to keep mementos of her past is also a valid point. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here. But in terms of social norms and personal boundaries, it's more about mutual respect. The husband is expressing a personal discomfort, which is understandable. However, the wife has the right to her own memories and how she chooses to preserve them. \n\nThe key question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If the dress is in the back of the closet and not causing any health issues, maybe his insistence is about control or insecurity. The wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as her asserting her autonomy. \n\nBut then again, maybe the husband has a valid point about hygiene and wanting to remove another man's bodily fluids from their shared home. The problem is that the issue is about a past relationship, not current infidelity. \n\nI think the answer depends on whose perspective you prioritize. If the husband's comfort is the main concern, he's justified. But if the wife's right to her memories is more important, then he's overreacting. However, the fact that he waited years to bring this up might indicate that his reaction is based on something new, perhaps insecurity or a change in his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband tried to address it, but the wife didn't take it seriously. So, the husband might be right in wanting it cleaned for his peace of mind, but he needs to consider the wife's feelings about her memories. \n\nGiven that the wife is keeping it in her closet and not flaunting it, maybe the husband is making a bigger deal out of it. On the other hand, he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned if he's uncomfortable. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because it's his home and he's the one who has to live with the discomfort. But I can see the argument that he's being controlling. However, since he's not objecting to her past relationships, just the physical remains, it's more about personal boundaries. So, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Some might say he's being controlling, others that he's being reasonable.\n"
