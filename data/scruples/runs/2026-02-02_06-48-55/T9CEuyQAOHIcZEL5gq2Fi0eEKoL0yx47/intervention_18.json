I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who doesn't want his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from her past, in their house. The wife is keeping it, and the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband says he's not jealous of her past partners, which is a key point. He's not upset about the affair itself but rather the presence of the stains. The wife has kept the dress for a long time, and only recently the issue came up when the friend mentioned the stains. The husband then asked her to get it cleaned, but she refused, saying he's overreacting.\n\nNow, I should think about the dynamics of their relationship. The husband's request seems to be about boundaries and comfort in their shared home. Even if he isn't jealous, having another person's bodily fluids in the house could be a hygiene or emotional issue. On the other hand, the wife is attached to the dress for sentimental reasons and feels her partner is overstepping by asking her to clean it.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his discomfort, which is valid. However, he might have approached the situation differently. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings without blaming her, focusing on his own discomfort rather than making a demand. But she's refusing to comply, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but is instead about cleanliness and personal boundaries, then maybe he's not wrong. However, the way he's handling it might be causing conflict. The wife's right to keep sentimental items versus the husband's right to a clean home. \n\nIn some ways, both have valid points. But the husband's request is about removing something that makes him uncomfortable, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his feelings. But maybe he should have considered her feelings more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is overreacting. The fact that the dress is a memory for her and the stains are from a long time ago might make the husband's request seem petty. But that's subjective. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The husband is trying to set a boundary, which is okay, but the way he's doing it might be causing more friction. The wife also needs to consider his feelings. \n\nSo, based on that, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but his approach could be better. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A or B. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he has the right to ask for cleanliness in their home, and his request is about something that affects him directly. The wife's refusal is her choice, but he's not wrong in wanting to address it.\n"
