I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before!

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a husband who's 41, and he and his wife met in college. She has an old prom dress in her closet that's been there forever. The issue started when a friend came over, and the wife showed the dress, which had spots. The friend mentioned the spots, and the wife said her date was a mess and she should have taken it off before they had sex. The friend said \"ew,\" and the wife laughed. Later, the wife brought the dress to the bedroom, mentioned how she loved it and wished the author had taken her to prom so they could have gotten \"dirty.\" The author told her he didn't want another guy's cum stains in their house and asked her to have it dry-cleaned. She said he never cared before and told him not to be jealous. The author says he's not jealous about her past partners but just doesn't want the cum stains. The wife refuses to clean it, and it's causing tension.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The wife has had the dress for a long time, it's a memory from her past. The husband is now objecting to it being in their home because of the bodily fluid. The wife might feel that her memories are important and that the husband is overreacting. The husband might feel that in a committed relationship, having a garment with another man's stain is inappropriate and unhygienic.\n\nThe husband says he's not jealous of her past partners, which is important. Jealousy about past relationships isn't uncommon, but he's clarifying that he's not upset about the affair itself, but the physical presence of the stain. However, the wife might see it as a personal item and a part of her history, which she has the right to keep. \n\nOn the other hand, in a shared living space, some people might feel uncomfortable with such items. But the husband didn't mind until now. The wife says he never cared before, so there's a possible inconsistency in his stance. Maybe he only became aware of the issue when the friend mentioned it. \n\nIs it reasonable for the husband to ask her to clean it? If the wife doesn't want to, is that her right? The husband might be overreacting if the stain isn't a health hazard. However, the presence of dried semen could be a concern for some people. But if the wife is okay with it and it's a cherished item, the husband's request might be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction of telling him not to be jealous suggests she feels he's being possessive or controlling. The husband claims he's not jealous. The situation might be more about differing values or boundaries in the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband brought it up, and the wife is refusing. If it's causing ongoing tension, maybe they need to find a compromise. But does that mean the husband is in the wrong? It's about personal boundaries and mutual respect. If the husband is uncomfortable with the item in their shared space, isn't it reasonable to discuss it? However, the wife has the right to keep personal items, even if they're from her past. \n\nThe husband didn't ask her to throw it away, just to clean it. If the wife is okay with cleaning it but doesn't want to, maybe the husband's request is reasonable. However, if the wife feels strongly about keeping it as a memory, the husband might need to respect that. \n\nBut the key point is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's actions (keeping the dress, showing it to a friend, making a joke about it) might be seen as not respecting the husband's boundaries once they were expressed. However, the husband's initial stance was that he didn't mind before. So it's a bit of a conflict. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate discomfort about having another man's bodily fluids in their home. However, the wife's right to her own memories and personal items is also a valid point. But since the husband is asking for a simple solution (cleaning it), which the wife is refusing without compromise, the husband's position could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
