I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had the dress for a long time, and the husband never thought about it until her friend mentioned the stains. The wife's friend noticed spots, and the wife explained it was her date who was a mess. Now the husband is uncomfortable with the stains and wants it cleaned. The wife doesn't want to, saying he's being jealous.\n\nSo the main issue is about the husband's reaction. Is he overreacting, or is he justified? Let's break it down.\n\nThe husband says he's not jealous of her past partners. He's okay with her having had sex before. But the presence of another man's bodily fluids in the house is what's bothering him. That seems more about personal boundaries and comfort rather than jealousy. On the other hand, the wife values the dress as a memory, even though it's stained. She's being defensive, calling him jealous, but he clarifies it's not about her past but the physical presence of someone else's fluids in their home.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both have valid points. The husband's discomfort is about something that's in their shared living space. Even if the dress is a memory, it's a hygiene and personal space issue. The wife might feel that erasing that memory by cleaning it would be dismissing her past. However, the husband's request seems reasonable. If a partner is uncomfortable with something in the home, especially something that could be considered unhygienic, the partner should respect that.\n\nBut then again, the wife is not the one to clean it; she's the one who brought it up. The husband is asking her to clean it because it's in their house now. The problem is her refusal. If the husband doesn't want it in the house, maybe they need to find a compromise, like the wife can keep it elsewhere or donate it. But if she insists on keeping it in their home, and he's not comfortable, then her stance is causing discomfort.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not jealous but just wants the stains removed for hygiene or comfort, then he's in the right. The wife is clinging to a memory, but it's in their shared space. On the other hand, if the husband is overstepping by not respecting her sentimental attachment, maybe he's in the wrong. But the key here is that the husband wants it cleaned, not destroyed. The wife could clean it and keep the dress. Her refusal to clean it, despite his discomfort, might make her the one in the wrong.\n\nWait, but the husband is the one who is uncomfortable. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If he's okay with her past but not the physical artifact in their home, that's his boundary. If she doesn't respect his boundary, maybe she's the one in the wrong. But maybe the husband's boundary is trivial? The stains are from years ago, and it's just a dress. But the husband's comfort is valid. It's a matter of differing priorities. \n\nIn some cases, people might consider the husband being overly sensitive. However, if the presence of the stains is causing him distress, then it's a legitimate issue. The wife could clean the dress to accommodate him without losing the memory. If she refuses, she's not respecting his feelings. So perhaps the husband is not in the wrong here. He's asking for a reasonable action (cleaning) to respect his comfort. The wife's refusal might be the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing a valid boundary about his home environment, and the wife not respecting that by keeping the uncleaned dress could be her issue.\n"
