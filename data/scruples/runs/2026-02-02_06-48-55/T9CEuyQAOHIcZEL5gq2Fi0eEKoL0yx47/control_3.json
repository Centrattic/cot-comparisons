I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author's wife has an old prom dress that's been in her closet for a long time. The author never thought about it until a friend came over and they discussed it. The friend noticed spots on the dress, and the wife mentioned that her prom date was a mess and that she should have taken off before they had sex. The friend made an \"ew\" comment, and the wife laughed. Later, the wife brings the dress into the bedroom and makes a comment about how she and the author could have gotten dirty in the limo. The author then expresses discomfort about another guy's cum stains in the house and tells her to get it dry cleaned. The wife responds that the author is overreacting, and the situation has become awkward since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's think about the key points. The author is married and not jealous about his wife's past partners. The issue here is specifically about the prom dress with cum stains. The author is uncomfortable with another guy's bodily fluids being in the house. The wife, on the other hand, values her memories related to the dress and refuses to get it cleaned.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries and respect, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable about this. Even though the wife is allowed to have memories, the presence of another person's bodily fluids in their shared home can be a reasonable concern for some people. However, the wife might argue that the author is overreacting because the author has never cared about her past before. The key here is about mutual respect and communication.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the author finds this unacceptable, it's his right to express that. However, the wife's refusal to comply and her dismissive attitude (\"don't be jealous\") might be seen as disregarding his feelings. On the other hand, the author might be overstepping if he's not given this issue much thought before. However, the situation has become a point of contention now. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of being \"not jealous\" but still having a specific boundary about bodily fluids. Jealousy is about current relationships, while this is more about cleanliness and personal preference. The author isn't necessarily jealous about the past but about the physical presence of another person's residue in their home. That's a different matter. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is stating his discomfort, which is valid. The wife, however, is holding onto her memories and dismissing his feelings. The problem arises from the lack of compromise. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" might be invalidating the author's feelings, even if the author's stance is about cleanliness rather than jealousy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort about having another man's cum in his house. It's about personal space and boundaries. The wife's refusal to accommodate this might be the issue, but the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
