I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's prom dress with cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has never been jealous of his wife's past and didn't mind the dress being in the closet until the friend's comment revealed the stains. The key issue here is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, which the husband now finds uncomfortable. \n\nMarital boundaries and personal comfort are important. While the wife values the dress as a memory, the husband's physical discomfort is valid. The question is about whether his reaction is reasonable. Some might argue that his request for it to be cleaned is about hygiene and personal space, not jealousy. Others might say the wife's right to keep a personal memento should be respected.\n\nI should check if there's a violation of any marital norms here. The husband isn't upset about the past relationship but the current physical presence of the stains. It's about personal boundaries in marriage. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his discomfort could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nI need to balance both perspectives. The husband isn't being jealous about the past, just about the physical presence of the stains. The wife is holding onto a memory, which is her right, but the husband's comfort in his own home is also a valid concern. \n\nIn similar situations, it's often about communication and compromise. The husband expressed his feelings, and the wife didn't take it seriously. That could lead to ongoing tension. The question is whether the husband's stance is unreasonable. Since he's not asking for the dress to be removed but cleaned for hygiene, it's a reasonable request. The wife's refusal might make him feel ignored, so the husband's position isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
