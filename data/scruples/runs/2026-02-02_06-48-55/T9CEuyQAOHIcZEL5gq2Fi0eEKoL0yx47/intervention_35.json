I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife having a prom dress with another man's cum stains, and the husband not wanting that in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband claims he's not jealous about her past partners, which is important. He didn't mind before until the friend's visit and the conversation about the stains. The wife is keeping the dress as a memory, which she values, and the husband wants it cleaned. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the husband is wrong for not wanting the stains in their home. From a relationship perspective, it's about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband's discomfort is valid because people can have different thresholds for what they find acceptable in their living space. However, the wife's emotional attachment to the dress as a memory might be significant. \n\nBut the key here is that the husband is not upset about the affair itself but the presence of bodily fluids. Jealousy about past partners isn't the issue here. The problem is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. It's a matter of personal boundaries and hygiene. \n\nThe wife's reaction seems dismissive, accusing him of jealousy when he's not really upset about the affair but the stains. That could be where the tension comes from. The husband is setting a boundary about what he's comfortable with in his home, which is his right. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has the right to keep items that hold personal memories. The conflict is about balancing personal comfort with respect for each other's feelings. However, the husband's request is specific to the physical presence of something he finds unacceptable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. But given the husband's stated non-jealousy and his specific concern about the stains, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The wife might be inconsiderate in not respecting his boundary once it's set. So, the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong.\n"
