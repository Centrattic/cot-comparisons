I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife's prom dress with cum stains from another guy in their house. The wife is upset and says he's being jealous, but he's not jealous about her past partners, just the physical presence of the stains.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is overstepping. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The author isn't upset about the past relationship itself, just the biological material left from it. The wife is keeping the dress as a memory, and the author is asking her to get it cleaned. \n\nSo, is it his place to demand she clean it? Well, in a shared home, both people have a right to feel comfortable. Even if he's not jealous, the presence of someone else's bodily fluids might be a hygiene or comfort issue. On the other hand, the wife has the right to keep personal mementos from her past, especially if they're important to her emotionally. \n\nThe author's request is reasonable from a health and cleanliness standpoint. However, the wife might see it as an infringement on her personal history. The problem arises if the author is making it a condition of their relationship without considering her feelings. If he's being overly controlling or dismissive of her memories, that could be problematic. But if he's just asking for cleanliness and not trying to erase her past, he might be justified.\n\nThe wife's reaction of calling him jealous and refusing to clean it might indicate she's more upset about the perceived criticism of her past than the actual stains. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting the house to be his, but he needs to communicate and find a compromise. However, the core issue is whether the stains themselves are a legitimate concern. Since bodily fluids can pose health risks (like STIs), asking to have it cleaned is reasonable. If the wife is aware of the health risks and still refuses, that's a problem. But maybe she's not aware or doesn't see it that way. \n\nAlternatively, if they're in a committed relationship, the author might have the right to expect a certain level of hygiene in their shared living space. However, he should approach it respectfully, not as a demand but as a joint decision. The wife's refusal could stem from emotional attachment, which he needs to respect while still advocating for his own comfort. \n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong for wanting the dress cleaned for hygiene and comfort reasons, but he needs to handle it sensitively. The wife's right to her memories is also valid, but health concerns should be a priority. Since the author is not being jealous but concerned about cleanliness, he's not in the wrong.\n"
