I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband being upset about his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a previous partner. The wife is keeping it in their closet despite his discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband isn't jealous of her past relationships, which is a good sign for their communication. But the issue is about the physical presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. The wife has good memories associated with the dress, while the husband finds it uncomfortable. \n\nNow, thinking about boundaries in a relationship. Even though the husband isn't jealous, he has a valid concern about health and cleanliness. Body fluids can carry pathogens, so from a health perspective, wanting it cleaned or disposed of is reasonable. On the other hand, the wife has emotional attachments to the dress. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is overstepping. He's asking for it to be cleaned, which is a practical solution. However, the wife's refusal might stem from emotional reasons. The husband's right to a clean living environment versus the wife's right to personal memories. \n\nAlso, how they handle the disagreement matters. If the husband is respecting her feelings but still firm about his needs, that's healthy. But if he's being controlling or dismissive of her emotions, that's problematic. In the scenario, the husband is clear about his discomfort but doesn't seem to be attacking her past; he's focused on the physical aspect. \n\nAnother angle: societal norms. Some people might find it unreasonable to have such an item in the home, while others prioritize the emotional significance. The husband's request is about cleanliness, which is a practical concern. The wife's stance is about personal history. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? Maybe not. It's about their shared space. However, the wife has the right to keep mementos if they don't pose a health risk. But the presence of bodily fluids could be a health issue. \n\nI think the husband has a valid point regarding hygiene. The wife could compromise by getting it cleaned, which would address his concern without her losing the dress. His insistence isn't about jealousy but cleanliness. If she refuses, maybe there's a deeper issue, but based on the given info, he's not wrong to want a clean home. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
