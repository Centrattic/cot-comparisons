I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife is resistant to getting it cleaned, and they've had an awkward situation since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband isn't jealous about her past partners but is upset about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't see the issue. \n\nThe husband's stance is about hygiene and personal comfort, which is understandable. It's not about jealousy per se, but about not wanting another person's bodily fluids in their shared living space. The wife's argument is emotional, focusing on her memories and the significance of the dress. \n\nNow, societal norms often vary here. Some might see the husband's request as reasonable, given that he has the right to a clean and comfortable home. Others might argue that the wife has the right to keep personal mementos, even if they're unhygienic. However, in a shared living environment, both partners should consider each other's feelings. \n\nBut the husband isn't objecting to the memories; he's objecting to the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids. That's a health and cleanliness issue rather than an emotional one. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as inconsiderate of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her emotional attachment justifies keeping the dress as it is. However, the presence of biological material can pose health risks, and asking to clean it isn't unreasonable. The husband is asking for a simple solution (dry cleaning) that would satisfy both hygiene and her memory. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but is concerned about cleanliness, he's not wrong in expressing that. The wife, however, might be prioritizing her feelings over his, which could be seen as self-centered. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband's request is about a reasonable health and hygiene concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
