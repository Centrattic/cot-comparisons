I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the wife has a prom dress from when she was younger, which has stains from a previous sexual encounter. The husband only becomes upset after hearing his wife talk about it with her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, which is important. He didn't mind the dress being there until the situation came up. The friend comments on the stains, and the wife makes a joke about her ex date being a mess. The husband then asks her to get the dress cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and boundaries. The husband is expressing discomfort with another man's bodily fluids in the house. That's a valid concern for some people. Even if he's not jealous, the presence of someone else's biological material might be a hygiene or emotional issue. On the other hand, the wife is attached to her memories and feels her husband is being possessive or controlling. She might see the dress as part of her past and not want to erase it.\n\nBut wait, they're married now. The husband is the one who's married to her, and she's bringing up past experiences in front of a friend, which might be a red flag for some. However, the issue here isn't her talking about it\u2014it's his reaction to the physical object. The question is whether his request is reasonable. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, if someone is uncomfortable with their spouse keeping an item that has someone else's bodily fluids, that's their right. However, maybe the husband is overstepping by not respecting her memories. But if the dress is in their home, and he's not okay with it, he's allowed to voice that. The wife's response of \"don't be jealous\" is dismissive, which could be an issue because he's not being jealous of the past but about current comfort in their home.\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The husband is within his rights to express discomfort with another man's bodily fluids in their shared living space. The wife is also within her rights to value her memories. However, the wife's refusal to clean it and her dismissive attitude might be problematic. The husband isn't trying to control her past but the current state of their home. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting it cleaned. The answer would be B (No).\n"
