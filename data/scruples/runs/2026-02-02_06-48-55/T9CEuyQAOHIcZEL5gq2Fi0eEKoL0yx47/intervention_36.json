I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting his wife's cum-stained prom dress in the house. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The wife has a prom dress with stains from an ex, and she's showing it to a friend. The author finds out and wants it cleaned, but the wife is upset and says he's overreacting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know.\n\nSo, from the husband's perspective, it's about personal comfort and boundaries. He doesn't object to her past, but the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home makes him uneasy. That's a valid reaction. He's asking for it to be cleaned for hygiene reasons, not out of jealousy. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as a memory and resents his request, calling him jealous. \n\nBut wait, the wife's behavior of showing the dress to a friend and making a joke about it might be part of the issue. She's bringing up her past in a way that's casual, which could make the husband uncomfortable. He's not upset about her past per se, but the current situation with the dress. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If he doesn't want something in the house that's making him uncomfortable, and it's a health concern (cum stains can be a hygiene issue if not cleaned), then his stance is understandable. However, the wife's right to keep her personal items might also be a factor. But in a shared home, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. \n\nThe husband isn't being controlling about her past; he's just not okay with the physical reminder. The wife's reaction of refusing to clean it and calling him jealous suggests she might not respect his feelings. But maybe the husband could have approached it more sensitively, like asking why she keeps it or discussing his feelings calmly instead of demanding it be cleaned. \n\nStill, the core issue is about personal comfort and household hygiene. If she's keeping the dress in their home and it's a source of discomfort, it's reasonable to ask for it to be cleaned or removed. The wife's insistence on keeping it as a memory, despite his feelings, might make her the wrong one here. \n\nWait, but maybe the husband is overstepping by dictating how she handles her personal items. However, since it's in their shared home, there's a balance. If the dress is a health hazard, then safety comes into play. If it's just a stain that's not harmful, maybe it's more about his emotional response. \n\nIn the end, the husband's request is about his comfort and hygiene, which are valid. The wife's refusal to clean it and dismissive attitude might make her the one at fault here. But the husband could be more understanding, but he's not entirely wrong in wanting it cleaned. So perhaps the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
