I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. The wife refuses to get it cleaned, saying he's being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband isn't jealous of her past partners but is uncomfortable with the physical remnants of her past. The key issue here is about boundaries and mutual respect. \n\nIn a marriage, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The husband is expressing a discomfort with something that's in their home. Even though the wife sees it as a memory, the husband finds it unacceptable. The wife's response dismisses his feelings by calling him jealous, which might be invalidating his perspective. \n\nHowever, the wife also has the right to hold onto personal mementos from her past, unless they cause harm. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Cum stains are unsanitary and could pose health risks, so wanting them cleaned might be about hygiene rather than jealousy. But the husband is asking her to remove it entirely, not just clean it. \n\nThe wife's refusal to clean it despite his repeated requests might indicate she's not respecting his boundaries. However, the husband could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing it calmly without making it about jealousy. But given that the stains are from someone else and they're in a committed relationship now, the husband's stance might be about maintaining a clean and comfortable shared space. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's right to personal memories is important. The problem arises when those memories affect the husband's comfort. The answer hinges on whether the husband's request is about jealousy or genuine discomfort. Since he clarifies he's not jealous of her past, but about the physical presence of another's bodily fluids, it's more about his personal boundaries. \n\nIn such cases, both partners need to negotiate. If the husband is uncomfortable, the wife should consider getting it cleaned. However, if she's unwilling, the husband might need to accept it or find another solution, like storing it elsewhere. But in a shared living space, mutual respect is key. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his requests could be seen as dismissive. \n\nTherefore, while both might have valid points, the husband's request isn't entirely without merit. If the stains are unsanitary, cleaning is reasonable. The wife's insistence on keeping it uncleaned might be the issue. However, if the husband is overreacting by not acknowledging her right to personal memories, he might be in the wrong. But given the context, the husband's discomfort is about hygiene and current living conditions, which could justify his stance.\n"
