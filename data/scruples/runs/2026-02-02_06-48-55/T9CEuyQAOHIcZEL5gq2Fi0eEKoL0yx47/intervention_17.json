I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it being in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never noticed or cared before. The issue arose when the wife's friend made a comment about the stains, leading the wife to disclose the story. The husband then expressed discomfort about having another man's stains in the house and asked her to clean it. The wife is against it, saying it's about her memories and he's being jealous.\n\nThe user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to consider both perspectives. From the husband's viewpoint, he's uncomfortable with bodily fluids from another person in their home, which is a matter of personal hygiene and boundaries. On the other hand, the wife sees it as a personal memory from her past and feels it's her choice to keep it.\n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, the dress is hers, and she's kept it in her closet. The husband's discomfort is valid, but he's making a request based on something he now finds distasteful. However, the wife is not obligated to clean it if it's her personal property. The argument here is about boundaries and respect for each other's feelings. The husband isn't being jealous about her past relationships but about the physical remnants in their home. The wife might see this as an invasion of her personal history or an unnecessary request. \n\nI think the key is whether the husband has the right to dictate how she handles her own property. The wife could choose to keep it, even if it's uncleaned, as long as it's not a health hazard. The husband's discomfort is his own issue, but he's imposing his feelings onto her. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. However, it's also possible that the husband's request is reasonable if he's genuinely uncomfortable. It's a nuanced situation where both have valid points. The question is whether the husband's reaction is justified. If the dress is in a private part of the home and not causing harm, maybe the husband is being overly sensitive. But if the husband feels it's a violation of their home's cleanliness, that's his perspective. \n\nI think the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings about something he's now aware of. He wasn't jealous before, but now that he knows, he has the right to ask her to clean it. However, the wife's right to her memories and her choice to keep the dress as is should be respected. The husband's request is valid, but the wife can choose to ignore it if it's her property. So, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife isn't in the wrong for refusing to clean it. The issue is more about communication and mutual respect rather than right or wrong. The husband's stance is based on his feelings, not on jealousy of her past, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
