I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress stained with another guy's cum in his house. They've been married a while, and he's not jealous about her past, but this specific thing is bothering him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The dress has been in her closet for years, and he never had an issue before. The problem started when the friend came over and mentioned the stains. The wife didn't hide the stains, even laughed about it, and the friend made an \"ew\" comment. Then the guy confronted her about it. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is he wrong to feel uncomfortable about another man's bodily fluids in their home? Maybe not. Everyone has different boundaries. He's not upset about her past relationships, just the physical presence of the stains. But the wife is keeping it as a memory, which she values. \n\nBut does he have a right to demand it be cleaned? If the house is their shared home, both should have a say. However, she might see it as her personal item and her right to keep it as is. So, is he overstepping by insisting on cleaning? Or is he within his right to feel it's unhygienic or unpleasant in their home?\n\nSome people might think he's overreacting, especially since he didn't have an issue before. Others might agree that after knowing about the stains, he's justified in wanting it cleaned. The key points are respect for each other's memories and the shared space. \n\nThe wife might feel he's being jealous or controlling, but he's not upset about her past, just the current situation. It's a matter of personal preference and boundaries. There's no clear right or wrong here, but it's about mutual respect. If he's made his feelings known and she's still keeping it, maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. But if he's forcing her to clean it against her wishes, that's another issue. However, he's just asking her to clean it, not taking it away. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He has a right to his feelings about the cleanliness and presence of another's bodily fluids in their home. The wife has her own memories, but the husband's request is reasonable. The problem is communication and compromise. Since she's not cleaning it despite his request, maybe the issue is more about their communication rather than him being in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
