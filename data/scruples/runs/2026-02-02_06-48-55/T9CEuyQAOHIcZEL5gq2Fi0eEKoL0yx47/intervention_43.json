I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" thread is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being uncomfortable with his wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned, and the author feels it should be dry cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has never had an issue before, but now he's making a big deal about the biological stains. The wife feels it's a part of her memory and doesn't want to erase it. The author's reasoning is about not wanting another man's bodily fluids in the house, but he also states he's not jealous. The wife is upset because he's overreacting.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is reasonable. On one hand, personal boundaries and comfort in shared living spaces matter. Bodily fluids can be a health concern, but the dress is in a closet, so maybe not a major health risk. The author's main issue is emotional\u2014discomfort with another man's presence in their home through the dress. But the wife values sentimental memories. \n\nIs the author overstepping by demanding the dress be cleaned? He's not being jealous about her past, but he's making a point about the physical presence of another man's semen. The wife might see this as dismissing her memories. But the author is within his rights to set boundaries in their home. However, if the dress is in her private closet and not a health hazard, maybe his reaction is excessive. The question is whether his discomfort is valid. Since he's not concerned about her past, but just the physical remnants, it might come down to personal preference. The wife's right to keep sentimental items versus the author's comfort. The author is trying to address a specific issue he finds uncomfortable, but if it's not affecting others, maybe he's in the wrong for being overly concerned. Alternatively, he's setting a boundary. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards the author not being wrong because he's expressing his discomfort, even if the wife disagrees. But maybe the author is being unreasonable because the dress is her personal item and not causing actual harm.\n"
