I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. The husband suddenly becomes uncomfortable with it after a friend comments on the stains, and the wife refuses to clean it, saying it's about her memories and that the husband is being jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points. The wife isn't hiding the dress; it's been in her closet for a long time. The husband never noticed or cared before. The friend's comment probably made him aware of the stains' origin, which he hadn't considered before. Now, he's asking her to clean it, but she's resistant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, this is about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband is expressing a discomfort with another man's bodily fluids being in their home. Even if he's not jealous of her past, the presence of something that's a physical remnant of her ex might be a personal boundary. On the other hand, the wife values her memories and feels the husband is overreacting. \n\nI should consider cultural or personal norms. Some might say that if it's a family heirloom or a personal memento, the wife has the right to keep it. But if the husband finds it repulsive, especially in their shared living space, that's also a valid feeling. The issue is about how to handle differing priorities. The husband is trying to communicate a boundary, but the wife is dismissive, labeling him as jealous. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for not wanting the stained dress in his house? It's about personal comfort. If the wife's memories are important to her, but the husband is bothered by the stains, they need to find a compromise. The wife's refusal to clean it shows she values her memory more than her husband's comfort. However, the husband could have addressed it respectfully without making her feel criticized for her past. \n\nAnother angle: the husband had never given it any thought before, so the sudden concern might be an overreaction. But if it's a matter of hygiene or personal boundaries in their home, then he's not necessarily wrong. The problem is how they're handling the disagreement. The wife's dismissiveness (\"you're overreacting,\" \"don't be jealous\") might be invalidating his feelings, which could be considered wrong. \n\nSo, the husband's stance is about his comfort in the shared space, and the wife's is about her personal history. Both have valid points, but the way they approach each other matters. If the husband is being unreasonable or making it about jealousy when he's not actually jealous, that's a problem. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable with the stain, he's not wrong for wanting it removed. \n\nThe answer likely depends on how the couple communicates and respects each other's boundaries. The husband isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his feelings. However, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, so maybe I need to check that again. \n\nWait, the user is the husband here. He's the one asking if he's in the wrong. The wife's response is dismissive. If the husband is in a committed relationship and the wife is keeping an item associated with her ex in their home, maybe the husband has a right to feel that it's intrusive. But if it's a matter of personal choice and the wife is not hiding it, then the husband's request might be unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, partners should respect each other's comfort levels. If the husband clearly communicated his discomfort and the wife refuses to accommodate, that's a problem. However, if he's bringing it up for the first time and she's been keeping it without issue, it's possible he's overstepping. \n\nThe friend's comment might have triggered his awareness, but he could have approached it differently. The wife's reaction is to dismiss his feelings as jealousy, which could be invalidating. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife might be at fault for not respecting his feelings. However, the initial question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. \n\nIf the wife is keeping the dress in her closet, which is her personal space, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if it's in their shared home and causing him distress, then he has a point. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he is expressing a valid concern about something in their shared home that makes him uncomfortable. The wife's response is dismissive and invalidating, which could be her fault. But the husband isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned or removed from their home. It's a matter of communication and compromise, but the question is about right or wrong. The husband's request seems reasonable, and the wife's refusal is more about her memories versus his comfort. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
