I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's upset about his wife's old prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner. He wants her to get it cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's being jealous and overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband claims he's not jealous about her past, which seems true because he didn't mind before. The issue arose after a friend commented on the stains, and the wife made a joke about her ex. The husband's main problem is that he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home now that they're married. The wife, on the other hand, values the dress as a memory and resists having it cleaned, interpreting his request as jealousy.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong for wanting the dress cleaned? Let me think. The husband's feelings about not wanting another man's cum in their house could be seen as a personal boundary. Even if he's not jealous of the past, the current situation is about their shared living space. However, the wife has a right to her memories and might see the dress as part of her history. The conflict here is between personal comfort and respecting a partner's memories.\n\nSome might argue that the husband is overstepping by pressuring her to clean something that's her personal item. Others might say that since they're married, he has a right to be comfortable in their home. The wife's refusal to comply could also be seen as dismissive of his feelings, as she labels him as jealous. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, bodily fluids might be seen as unhygienic, but others view them as part of personal history. The husband's request is about cleanliness, but the wife sees it as an attack on her past. \n\nThe wife's reaction, calling him jealous and overreacting, might be a deflection. If the husband isn't jealous of her past, but just wants the stain gone, her response could be invalidating his feelings. \n\nBut is the husband wrong for bringing it up? Maybe not entirely. It's his home too, and he has the right to express discomfort. However, the wife has the right to keep personal items. The problem is the conflict in their boundaries. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting it cleaned, but he could be wrong in the way he's handling it, especially if it's causing ongoing conflict. \n\nThe wife's refusal to consider cleaning it, despite his request, could be where she's in the wrong, but he's also pushing for her to change something that's her sentimental item. It's a mutual issue, but the question is specifically about the husband's actions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being in the wrong often involves violating norms of respect or overstepping. If the husband is being controlling, then he's in the wrong. If he's just expressing his discomfort and the wife isn't respecting that, she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband's stance is about personal boundaries in their shared space. Since they are married, he has a right to feel that the house should be clean to his standards. However, the wife's memories are her own. The husband isn't being jealous of the past relationship, so maybe he's not wrong. But the wife's refusal to even consider cleaning it, given that it's causing discomfort, might be where she's at fault. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is being overly controlling by pressuring her to clean a personal item. The dress is her's, and unless there's a hygiene issue (which cum might not be a major one if it's been stored properly), he might be overreacting. \n\nBut the wife's comment about her ex and making a joke in front of him could have triggered the husband's request. The husband's request is about the current situation, not the past. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. The husband's desire for a clean home is valid, but the wife's right to her memories is also valid. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If the dress is a health risk, maybe, but otherwise, it's a personal item. The wife's refusal to clean it might be her right. \n\nSo, maybe the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but the wife is in the wrong for not respecting his feelings. However, if the dress isn't a health issue, the husband's insistence could be seen as controlling. \n\nIn AITA terms, often the person who is being dismissive of their partner's feelings is at fault. The wife dismissing his request as jealousy, even if she's not jealous, could be invalidating. But the husband's request is reasonable if it's causing him discomfort. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong (B) because he's expressing a valid boundary about his home, and the wife is in the wrong for not respecting that. However, another perspective might say the husband is overstepping by pressuring her to clean something personal. But given that the husband is clear he's not jealous and just wants the stain gone, maybe he's justified. The answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
