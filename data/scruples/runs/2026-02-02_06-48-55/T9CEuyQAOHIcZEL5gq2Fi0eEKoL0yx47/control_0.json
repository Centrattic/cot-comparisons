I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The author's wife has a prom dress from when she was younger, which is in their closet. The wife had a date who \"made a mess\" on the dress, leading to spots. The wife and her friend mentioned this, and later the author confronted her about not wanting the dress with another man's cum stains in the house. The wife said he never cared before and refused to clean it, making the author feel overreacting.\n\nHmm, first, the author isn't jealous of the wife's past, which is important. But the issue here is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The author is uncomfortable with that, even though it's a memory for the wife. So, the core conflict is about personal boundaries and comfort within a shared living space.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, each person has their own boundaries. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. The wife, on the other hand, values the memory associated with the dress and doesn't want to get it cleaned. The question is whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. Since the wife herself is the one who mentioned the stains and laughed about it, maybe the author didn't know about it before. But once he brought it up, the wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut wait, the wife had the dress in their closet for a long time, and the author never noticed until the friend pointed it out. The wife's comment about \"getting dirty in the limo\" seems to be a joke or a reference to their current relationship. However, the presence of stains from a past partner is still a physical object in their shared home. The author is asking for it to be removed or cleaned for his own comfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The wife is within her right to keep a dress with personal meaning, even if it has stains. The author is within his right to request its removal or cleaning because it's in their home. The problem might be in the wife's reaction, calling the author overreacting and not taking his feelings into account. However, the author's request isn't about her past or the memory itself but the physical presence of the stains in their home. \n\nSo, if the author is uncomfortable with the stains, is it his right to ask them to be cleaned? Or is the wife justified in keeping the dress as a memento? The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author is trying to communicate his discomfort, but the wife is not respecting that boundary. The fact that the author had to confront her twice and it's causing awkwardness suggests that there's a need for compromise. \n\nThe wife's insistence on keeping the dress despite the author's feelings might make her the one in the wrong, but the author could be overstepping if the dress is a personal keepsake. However, since they share a home, the author's request for a clean living space is reasonable. The wife should consider her partner's feelings even if the dress has sentimental value to her. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing his personal boundaries about having another man's bodily fluids in their home, which is a valid concern. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his request is where the issue lies. The author isn't being jealous about her past, just about the physical presence of the stains now.\n"
