I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe husband found out that his wife's prom dress has cum stains from a past partner. He's uncomfortable with it and wants her to get it dry-cleaned. She doesn't want to, saying he's overreacting and that it's part of her good memories. They've been married a while, and he's not jealous of her past, but this specific issue is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is expressing discomfort with another person's bodily fluids in his home. That's a valid personal preference. He's not upset about the affair itself but the physical remnants. On the other hand, the wife values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to erase them. She might feel that he's being possessive or jealous, even if he claims not to be.\n\nLegally, there's no issue. They're married, and both have consensual past experiences. Emotionally, the husband's discomfort is about boundaries in their shared living space. The wife's stance is about preserving personal history. The key here is whether his demand is unreasonable. \n\nHe's asking her to clean it for his comfort, not to erase her past. She refuses, possibly seeing it as an unnecessary intrusion. The problem is that their expectations don't align. Maybe the husband should have addressed it sooner, but the issue is recent. However, his request is about their home environment. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's feelings is crucial. If he's genuinely uncomfortable, it's reasonable to ask for a solution that respects both their needs. However, if the wife is unwilling to compromise, the husband's persistence might be seen as overstepping, but his initial request isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe friend's comment brought the issue to light, so maybe the timing is awkward. The husband's reaction could be seen as a boundary issue. But considering that he's not asking for the dress to be destroyed but cleaned, it's more about hygiene and personal space. The wife's refusal might stem from emotional attachment, but the husband's feelings are valid too. \n\nOverall, while the wife's perspective is about memories, the husband's request is about maintaining a comfortable home. Since they're married, they need to find a middle ground. The husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
