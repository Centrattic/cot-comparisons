I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has stains from a previous partner. The husband is uncomfortable with it being in the house and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying not to be jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he says he's not jealous of her past, the physical presence of the stain is a problem for him. On the other hand, the wife views the dress as a memory from her past and doesn't want to erase it by cleaning it. She also mentions that her husband never cared before, which might indicate that this is a new issue arising after the incident with the friend.\n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's expressing a discomfort with something he's always known about but now finds offensive. The wife's argument is about personal history and memories. However, the husband is the one who now feels it's an issue in their shared home. The question is about ownership and mutual respect in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, partners have the right to express their comfort levels, even if it's about things they previously didn't mind. The husband's request is about maintaining a clean and comfortable home environment. However, the wife's refusal is based on her emotional attachment to the item. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable. Since the dress is in their home, and the husband is the one who now objects, it's a matter of mutual respect. The wife might be in the wrong if she's dismissing his feelings without considering them. But the husband might be overreacting if he's now holding onto past events he previously didn't care about. \n\nHowever, the presence of another man's bodily fluids in the house is a hygiene and personal comfort issue. Even if the wife doesn't see it as a problem, the husband's right to a clean home can be argued. The wife's refusal to clean it, despite knowing it upsets her husband, might be the issue here. \n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking for it to be cleaned. The wife is being dismissive of his feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
