I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. The wife is upset because he's bringing it up now, even though she's been keeping the dress for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is the presence of another man's semen in their home. From a health or cleanliness standpoint, that could be a valid concern. Even if the wife finds the stains insignificant as part of her memories, the husband might feel uncomfortable. However, the wife argues that she has good memories and doesn't want to get it cleaned because it's part of her past. She also mentions that the husband never cared before, which adds to her frustration now.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to get the dress cleaned unless there's a health hazard, which might not be the case. But in terms of marriage and mutual respect, it's about communication and boundaries. The husband is expressing discomfort, which he has a right to do. However, bringing it up after so many years might make it seem like he's overreacting, especially if she's been fine with it all along. The wife's reaction of calling him jealous and overreacting could indicate that she feels he's being possessive or not respecting her past.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to his own comfort in their home. If the presence of the stains is causing him distress, he's entitled to express that. The problem here is whether his request is reasonable. Since it's a personal item of the wife's, she might have the right to decide what to do with it. However, if it's in their shared home and causing tension, compromise might be necessary.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. Some people might view the husband's reaction as overly sensitive, while others might see his concern as valid. The key is whether the husband's request is respectful and whether they can find a middle ground. Maybe the wife could agree to keep the dress but store it in a way that's less intrusive, or the husband could accept her decision if it doesn't affect their living space negatively.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the way he's handling it might be problematic. He's not wrong to ask for it to be cleaned if it's causing him stress, but he might need to approach the situation with more sensitivity to her feelings about her past. Since the wife is unwilling to comply, it's a matter of where they draw the line between personal comfort and respecting each other's boundaries. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort in a relationship context, even if the resolution requires more discussion. The wife's refusal to clean it might be the bigger issue here, but the husband isn't wrong for having that request.\n"
