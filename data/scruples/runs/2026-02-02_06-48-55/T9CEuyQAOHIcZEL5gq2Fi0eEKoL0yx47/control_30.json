I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife had the dress in her closet for a long time, and the husband never cared before. The issue came up when the wife's friend visited, and they discussed the dress. The wife mentioned the stains and laughed about it. The husband then confronted her about not wanting the stains in the house. The wife is upset, saying it's her memory and he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective: he's uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid feeling. Jealousy isn't the issue here; he's not mad about her past relationships, just the physical presence of the stains. On the other hand, the wife feels it's her memory and doesn't want to clean it. \n\nBut here's the thing: the husband never had an issue before. The problem only arose after the conversation with the friend. That might mean the husband's reaction is a recent change in stance, which could be seen as overreacting. However, the presence of bodily fluids in the home is a health and comfort issue. The wife's argument that it's her memory might not override the husband's discomfort. \n\nIn many relationships, such issues can be subjective. But the key points are mutual respect and communication. The husband expressed his discomfort, which is his right. The wife's refusal to clean it might be her way of holding onto a memory, but it's causing current tension. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If the wife agreed to clean it to respect his feelings, that would be reasonable. But since she's refusing, the husband is standing his ground. However, maybe his initial reaction was triggered by the recent conversation, making it seem like a new issue. The question is whether his feelings are valid. Since he's not jealous but concerned about the physical presence, it's his right to feel that way. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing a valid personal boundary. But if the wife isn't violating any rules except his personal comfort, then it's a matter of compromise. However, the husband's stance is about his home, so maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife has been keeping the dress for a long time without issue, his sudden objection might be inconsiderate. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer depends on whether the husband's demand is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the dress was a memory for her, maybe he's being inconsiderate by not allowing her to keep it. But the presence of another's bodily fluids could be a health concern. Wait, but is cum a health hazard? Probably not, unless there's a specific concern. So maybe the husband's issue is more about discomfort than health. In that case, the wife might be in the right to keep it, and the husband is overstepping by demanding it be cleaned. But the question is about the husband being in the wrong. If the wife agreed to keep it, but the husband now objects, the husband might not be in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. However, if the wife's keeping the dress is a personal right, then the husband is overstepping. I'm a bit torn. But given that the husband is not jealous and the issue is about the physical presence of another man's stains, which is a personal preference, and the wife is keeping it as a memory, the husband's stance might be seen as overreacting. Therefore, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). Wait, but in the scenario, the husband never had an issue before. Maybe the problem is that he's bringing it up now, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife had the dress in the closet, and he only objected after the friend's visit. So his reaction is a new problem. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for changing his stance and not respecting her established memory. So answer A. But earlier I thought maybe B. This is confusing. Let me check again. The key is whether his objection is valid. If the dress has cum stains, and he doesn't want that in his home, is that a reasonable request? If the wife is okay with it, but he's not, then maybe the husband is being selfish. However, in their home, both partners should consider each other's comfort. If the husband is uncomfortable, asking to clean it isn't unreasonable. But if the wife refuses, he can't force her. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's not being jealous and just wants the dress cleaned for his own comfort, then he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But if the wife's refusal to clean it is her right, then the husband is in the wrong for not respecting her choice. Hmm. The line between personal boundaries and respect for partner's memories is thin here. The husband's request is valid, but the wife's refusal is also valid. So perhaps the husband isn't in the wrong for making the request, but the wife isn't wrong for refusing. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband's request is reasonable, then no. If the wife's keeping it is her right, then the husband is wrong for objecting. But cum stains aren't a health issue, so maybe the husband is overreacting. Therefore, answer A. Maybe. But I'm not sure. I think the answer is B, the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort in his own home. So I'll go with B.\n"
