I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife has had the dress for a long time, and only recently, after a friend's visit where she mentioned the stains, the husband brings it up. The husband isn't jealous of her past but is uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and refuses to have it cleaned.\n\nNow, considering personal boundaries. The husband's discomfort is valid. Even if he's not jealous, the idea of another person's bodily fluids in his home can be a hygiene and emotional issue. However, the wife has a right to her own memories and may not see the need to remove something that's part of her past. \n\nIs he overstepping? Maybe. The dress is hers, and she's not harming anyone by keeping it. The husband's request could be seen as controlling if he's dictating what she can keep in the house, especially if she's not sharing it with others. But, if it's causing him distress, he's also within his rights to express that. \n\nCommunication is key here. The husband tried to talk about it, but the wife dismissed his feelings as jealousy, which might not be accurate. The husband's issue isn't jealousy but personal comfort. The wife's refusal to clean it might be a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both have valid points. However, the husband's stance is about his personal space and comfort, which is understandable. The wife's stance is about her personal history and memories. Since the dress is in her closet and doesn't affect others, the husband's request might be seen as unreasonable unless there are hygiene concerns. But since it's a one-time mention and the wife isn't hiding it, maybe the husband is overreacting. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, keeping items with such stains might be taboo, in others, not. The husband's discomfort is real. However, the wife isn't obligated to clean it unless they have a mutual agreement. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the wife is the owner of the dress and it's not causing harm beyond the husband's discomfort, maybe the husband is overstepping. Therefore, answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
