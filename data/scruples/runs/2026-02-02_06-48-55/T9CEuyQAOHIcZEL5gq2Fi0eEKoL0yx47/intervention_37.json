I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. The situation is that the wife has had the dress in her closet for a long time, and when a friend came over, she brought it out, showed it, and made a comment about the date. The author then confronted her about the stains and wants her to get it dry cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife and author are in a committed relationship, married, and she's had the dress since college. The author isn't jealous of her past, but the issue is the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to get rid of it, even though she's aware of the stains.\n\nSo the main question is about boundaries and personal discomfort. The author is expressing a personal boundary\u2014feeling uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in the house. Is it reasonable for him to ask for it to be cleaned? The wife might see it as an old memory and not a big deal, but the author is now upset by it. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the author is genuinely uncomfortable, it's not necessarily about jealousy but about personal space and hygiene. The wife might not understand that his discomfort isn't from jealousy but from the actual presence of something he finds unhygienic or disturbing. However, the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissing his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, cum stains from her past, especially if they're old and not a current issue, might be a matter of perspective. If the stains are not visible or cleaned properly, maybe it's a non-issue. But the author is specifically mentioning the presence of \"cumstains,\" implying it's not just a regular stain. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's actions of showing the dress to her friend and making a joke about it in front of the husband might have been inconsiderate. The husband's reaction is about the physical item in their shared home. Even if the wife doesn't think it's a problem, the husband has a right to his feelings. But is it the author's right to demand the wife get rid of her personal item? \n\nIf the husband isn't asking her to remove the dress but to clean it, that's one thing. But if he's asking her to get rid of the dress or make her feel guilty about her past, that might be different. Here, he's asking to dry clean it. So it's more about hygiene and comfort in their shared space. \n\nThe wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his boundaries, even if her stance is about her memories. The key is communication. The husband should express his discomfort without being accusatory, and the wife might need to acknowledge his perspective. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's friend made a comment about the spots, the wife confirmed it was a date, and the husband is now upset. The wife might not see the issue because it's from the past, but the husband has a valid concern if he's not comfortable with it. However, the wife's right to her personal items and memories versus the husband's comfort in their home. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The husband's request is reasonable, but the wife has a right to her feelings too. If the dress isn't causing any health issues, maybe it's a matter of personal preference. But the husband's emotional response is valid as well. \n\nIn some cultures or personal beliefs, bodily fluids from past partners might be a bigger deal. The wife might not understand why it's a problem, but the husband does. The author's problem isn't with the wife's past actions but the current presence of the item in their home. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and requesting the dress to be cleaned. It's about personal boundaries in the home. However, the wife's right to her memories is also a valid point. The issue is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since it's a shared space, and he's the one living there, it's not unreasonable to ask for it to be cleaned if it affects his peace of mind. \n\nBut maybe the husband is overreacting? If the stains are dried and not a health hazard, perhaps. However, the emotional aspect might be more significant. The wife's joke about getting dirty in the limo might have triggered the husband's discomfort. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is justified. If the stains are causing him distress, then it's a legitimate issue. The wife might need to compromise, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong to ask for the dress to be cleaned. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
