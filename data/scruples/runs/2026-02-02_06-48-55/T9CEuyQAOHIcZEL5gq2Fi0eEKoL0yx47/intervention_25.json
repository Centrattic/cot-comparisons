I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's cum-stained prom dress in their house. The situation is that the wife has had this dress in her closet for a long time, and the author never thought about it until his wife mentioned it to her friend. The friend pointed out the stains, and the wife laughed it off, saying her date was a mess. Then the author confronted her about it, saying he doesn't want another guy's cum in the house and asked her to get it cleaned. She refused, saying not to be jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says he's not jealous about her past partners, which is a key point. He's not upset about the affair itself but about the presence of the stain in their home. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress. She might see it as part of her past and important to her. \n\nNow, the author's argument is about comfort in their shared home. If you're in a relationship, you might expect mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author is expressing a boundary\u2014wanting the stain removed because it's in their house. The wife is resisting because it's a personal item with sentimental value. \n\nBut is the author overstepping? The dress is her personal item, and unless it's a health hazard, it's her choice to keep it. However, the author is the one living in the same house, so he has a valid concern about the presence of another person's bodily fluids. But then again, unless it's causing a hygiene issue, it's her personal history. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's behavior. She might have been insensitive in bringing it up in front of the author after knowing he found it awkward. Maybe she didn't consider his feelings when she showed it to her friend. But the author's reaction is about the stain, not the fact that she had sex with someone else. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If he's not jealous about her past but is upset about the physical presence of another person's fluids in their home, that's a valid boundary. However, if the wife is keeping it in her own closet, is that his problem? It's a balance between personal history and shared space. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is being overly controlling. The wife has a right to keep personal items, even if they're from her past. The author's request to clean it might be seen as trying to erase her past, which she's not obligated to do. \n\nI think the key here is whether the presence of the stain is a legitimate health or comfort issue. If it's just a stain from past use and not actively causing problems, the author might be overreacting. The wife's refusal to clean it is her right, and the author's insistence could be seen as being jealous or controlling, even if he claims he's not. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
