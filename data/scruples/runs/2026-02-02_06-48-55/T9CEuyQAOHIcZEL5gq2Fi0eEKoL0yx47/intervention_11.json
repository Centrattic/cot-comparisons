I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dress that has cum stains from a past relationship, and the husband is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's not jealous about his wife's past partners, but now that he's aware of the cum stains, he's uncomfortable keeping the dress in the house. He asked her to get it cleaned, which she refused. He's not upset about the sexual encounter itself but the physical remnants of it in their home.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has had the dress for a long time and associates it with good memories. She finds the husband's reaction over the top and insists on keeping it as it is. She even laughed about the incident when she showed the dress to her friend, indicating she doesn't see it as a problem.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries. The husband has the right to feel uncomfortable with another person's bodily fluids in his home. Even if he's not jealous, the presence of someone else's ejaculate in their shared space could be a valid concern for hygiene and personal boundaries. However, the wife's right to keep a memento from her past is also a factor here.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Asking for the dress to be dry cleaned isn't about removing a stain but about removing a specific bodily fluid that another person left. It's a matter of personal space and comfort. The wife's refusal might be seen as dismissing his feelings, but she's also asserting her right to keep a personal item. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The husband expressed his discomfort, and the wife didn't take it seriously. However, the husband's reaction isn't about jealousy but about the physical presence of another man's ejaculate. It's a boundary issue. \n\nI think the husband is within his rights to request the dress be cleaned. The wife, however, is also within her rights to keep the dress as a memory. The conflict arises from differing values on what's acceptable in their shared living space. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not being jealous but is concerned about the presence of another man's bodily fluids, then his stance is about personal boundaries. The wife's refusal to clean it might be disrespectful to his feelings. However, the husband could have approached it more sensitively. But in terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
