I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's cum-stained prom dress in their house. The situation is that the wife had the dress for a long time, and the author only became upset after hearing her talk about it with a friend. He wants it cleaned, but she refuses, saying not to be jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's side is about her memories and feelings towards the dress. She might see it as a part of her past and not something she wants to erase. The author's side is about discomfort with bodily fluids from someone else in their home. It's not about jealousy towards her past partners but about the physical presence of another man's cum in their house.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author's request isn't about controlling his wife's past but about maintaining a clean and comfortable living environment. However, the wife might feel that her autonomy and personal memories are being respected. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the dress is in their home, and the presence of bodily fluids could pose a health or cleanliness issue, the author has a legitimate concern. On the other hand, the wife's right to keep personal items is also valid. \n\nBut the problem arises from the author's reaction. If he's not jealous about her past, why the sudden issue? It could be overreacting if there's no prior issue. However, the mention of cum stains is a new problem. The author is asking for the dress to be cleaned, not to be thrown away, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal, especially after the author's explanation, might be seen as disregarding his feelings. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The wife has a right to her memories, and the author has a right to his comfort. The question is about whose needs take precedence. Since the author didn't object before, maybe he's overreacting now. However, if the presence of the dress is causing him discomfort, it's his right to express that. The wife's refusal might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. But from a typical AITA perspective, the author might be seen as in the right because he's asking for something that affects their living space. The wife might be the one in the wrong for not respecting his feelings once he expressed them. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed it earlier if it was a concern. But since he didn't know about the stains before, his reaction is understandable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
