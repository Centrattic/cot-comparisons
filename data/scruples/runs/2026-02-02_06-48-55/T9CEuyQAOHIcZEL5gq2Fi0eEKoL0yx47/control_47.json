I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife's prom dress that's stained with another guy's cum, and the husband not wanting it in his house.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband isn't jealous about his wife's past partners, so that's not the issue. The problem is the physical presence of the dress with those stains. He's asked her to get it dry-cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's overreacting and not being jealous. He's brought it up again, and now it's causing awkwardness.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the husband's side, he might find the idea of another man's bodily fluids in his home uncomfortable. Even though he's not jealous, it's a matter of personal boundaries and cleanliness. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory from her past and feels it's important to her to keep it as is. She might not understand why he's upset if he's not jealous.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and typical relationship dynamics. In many relationships, personal space and shared living environments can be a gray area. The husband is asking to remove the item for his comfort, while the wife is asserting her right to keep her personal mementos. The question is whether the husband's request is unreasonable.\n\nThe husband isn't asking for her to stop having memories or to erase her past. He just wants the stains removed because they make him uncomfortable. Dry cleaning might not necessarily remove the stains, but it's a way to make the item presentable without keeping the actual stains. The wife's reaction is about not wanting to lose the memories tied to the dress, which is valid, but the husband's discomfort is also his right.\n\nI need to check if there's a middle ground. For example, could the wife have the dress cleaned so that the stains are gone, preserving the dress while respecting the husband's feelings? If the stains are important to her, maybe she could keep it in another location, but the husband wants it out of his house entirely.\n\nAlso, the wife's friend was present when the stains were revealed, and they found it awkward. The husband's reaction after the friend left might be because the situation became more personal. However, the wife's insistence on not cleaning it despite his discomfort might be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, but the wife is not willing to compromise. The author is standing by his stance, so the answer depends on whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not being jealous but rather uncomfortable with the physical presence of the stains, it's more about personal boundaries. The wife is being asked to respect his boundaries, which she's refusing. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband is overstepping by making her clean something that's her personal item and not a problem for others. It's a bit of a toss-up. The husband's request is about maintaining a comfortable home environment, which is understandable. The wife's attachment to the dress as a memory is also understandable. But the husband isn't asking her to get rid of the dress, just to have it cleaned. If the dress itself is okay after cleaning, then his request is reasonable. The wife's refusal could be seen as not respecting his feelings, even if she's not being unfaithful or anything. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort about a specific item in their shared living space, and the wife is not respecting that boundary. The husband isn't being jealous; he's just not wanting another person's bodily fluids in his home, which is a valid personal preference.\n"
