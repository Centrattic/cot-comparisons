I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who finds out that his wife's prom dress, which she's kept for a long time, has cum stains from an ex-partner. He's not jealous about her past relationships but is now uncomfortable with the dress being in their home. The wife laughs off the situation when a friend comments on the stains and later makes a joke about the prom night. The husband asks her to have the dress dry-cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting and not jealous. The issue is causing tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't about the sex itself but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife values the dress as a memory and doesn't see why he's upset. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of personal boundaries and communication. The husband might feel that the dress is a physical reminder of his wife's past, which he's uncomfortable with even though he's not jealous. The wife, on the other hand, might see the dress as a cherished memory and feel her past is her own business. \n\nMarriage involves mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is valid even if others might not understand it. However, the wife might feel that her decision to keep the dress is her prerogative. \n\nBut wait, the husband is asking her to remove something from the house that she brought into it. If the wife owned the dress before marriage, maybe it's her property to keep. But once it's in their shared home, the husband has a say in what's kept there. However, this can depend on cultural norms and how the couple views shared versus individual property. \n\nThe wife's refusal to clean the dress despite the husband's request could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. Even if she doesn't see the issue, she's not respecting his emotional boundary. Conversely, the husband might be overreacting if the dress is a personal memento and there's no health risk. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's reasoning is not jealousy about her past but about not wanting another man's remains in the house. That's different from being possessive. Still, the wife's actions in keeping the dress without considering his feelings could be the issue here. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's making a reasonable request to have the dress removed for his comfort, and the wife is refusing without considering his feelings, maybe the wife is in the wrong. However, if the husband's request is unreasonable (like if it's a health issue but there's no evidence of that), then he's overstepping. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The husband expressed his feelings, and the wife dismissed them. In a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's feelings. If the wife doesn't take his discomfort seriously, she might be at fault. \n\nBut some people might argue that the husband is being overly sensitive and that the wife's memories are her own. It's a grey area. However, since the husband is the one making the request and the wife is not respecting his wishes, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the husband's reaction is irrational, he could be. \n\nGiven that the husband states he's not jealous about her past but is uncomfortable with the physical presence of the stains, it's about personal boundaries. The wife's refusal to clean it shows she's not respecting his boundary. Therefore, maybe the wife is in the wrong, so the author is not in the wrong (Answer B).\n"
