I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their home. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but is curious about my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's main issue is discomfort with another man's bodily fluids being in their house. He's not jealous about her past relationships but is bothered by the physical presence of the stains. The wife, on the other hand, values the memories associated with the dress and refuses to have it cleaned. \n\nFrom a personal boundary perspective, the husband's feelings are valid. Everyone has different thresholds for what they find acceptable in their living space. Even if he's not jealous about her past, the idea of another person's bodily fluids lingering in their home could be a legitimate hygiene or comfort issue. However, the wife's stance is about preserving her memories. She might see the dress as a part of her history and not want it altered.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, respecting each other's feelings is key. The husband did express his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it as jealousy. If the husband isn't jealous but just wants the item removed for personal reasons, the wife's dismissal might be invalidating his feelings. But if he's overreacting by making a big deal out of it, maybe the wife's refusal isn't wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that the husband brought it up multiple times might indicate that it's bothering him significantly. However, the wife's refusal could be because she doesn't see the issue. It's a clash of personal values. Legally, there's no wrong here, but in terms of relationship dynamics, both need to find a middle ground. \n\nIn such cases, compromise is often necessary. The husband might need to accept that the dress stays if cleaning isn't an option, or the wife might agree to have it cleaned, even if she doesn't see the problem. The husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but he might be in the wrong if he's being rigid or not allowing compromise. Conversely, the wife isn't wrong for valuing her memories.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Since he's not being jealous but is being specific about the presence of the stains, it's more about personal boundaries. If he respects her memories but still doesn't want the stains, it's a matter of differing priorities. Maybe the husband's stance is a reasonable personal boundary, so he isn't in the wrong. However, if he's making an issue of something that the wife doesn't see as a problem, he might be overstepping. \n\nThe key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If he's not jealous and just wants the item cleaned for practical reasons, then he's not wrong. But if he's using the stains as a way to express jealousy, then he might be wrong. The wife's friend's comment and the wife's own laughter suggest it's not a big issue for her, but the husband's persistence shows it's a problem for him. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's discomfort isn't about jealousy, so it's his right to not want that in his house. The wife's refusal is about her memories. Since both have valid points, but the question is about the husband's wrongness, the answer likely leans towards him not being in the wrong (B), because he's respecting his boundaries without being jealous, and the wife respecting hers. However, the nuance is that relationships require compromise, so it's more about communication than who is right.\n"
