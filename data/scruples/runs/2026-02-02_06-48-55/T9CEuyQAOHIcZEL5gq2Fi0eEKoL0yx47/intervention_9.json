I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on AITA (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress that has cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in his home, which is a common concern for many people. He's not jealous of her past but is uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's stains. On the other hand, the wife values the memories associated with the dress and refuses to clean it, seeing it as her personal history.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The husband is within his rights to express discomfort about having someone else's biological material in the house. However, the wife has the right to keep personal mementos unless there's a specific reason to remove them. The husband's request is reasonable, but the wife's refusal might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? He's not being jealous about her past partners, so it's not about past relationships but about the physical presence in their shared home. The wife's response (\"don't be jealous\") might be invalidating his feelings. However, the husband could have approached the situation with more sensitivity. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might find it unreasonable to ask to clean a personal item that's a memory, while others agree with the husband. The answer might be a nuanced \"A\" (the author is in the wrong) because pushing for the dress to be cleaned could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's her personal item and not a health hazard. Alternatively, \"B\" could be argued because respecting personal boundaries is important. \n\nBut the husband is in a shared home, so his concern about bodily fluids in their space is valid. However, the wife has the right to keep her memories unless there's a health issue. The husband's request isn't about her past but about the physical presence, which she might not need to comply with. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because he's expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution that he's comfortable with, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting it cleaned.\n"
