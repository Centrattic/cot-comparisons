I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress, which has cum stains from a past partner, in their house. The wife is upset that he's bringing it up now, even though it's been in the closet for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's issue isn't necessarily about jealousy over past relationships but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. He's not upset about the sex itself, just the stains. The wife feels it's her memory and doesn't want to get it cleaned, seeing it as part of her past.\n\nMarital dynamics are important here. While the husband isn't jealous about her past partners, the sudden objection might make her feel like he's being controlling or not respecting her history. On the other hand, the husband has a valid concern about something in their shared living space that he finds uncomfortable. He's asked her to clean it, which is a reasonable request.\n\nBut the wife's refusal and her comment about him being jealous might be invalidating his feelings. She's not wrong for holding onto a memory, but maybe there's a middle ground. The husband's issue isn't about the sex but the stains, so it's more about cleanliness and personal discomfort rather than jealousy. However, bringing it up after it's been there for years could be seen as overreacting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The husband isn't wrong to express his discomfort, but the wife is within her rights to keep the dress if it's important to her. The conflict arises from differing values: his cleanliness and boundaries vs. her emotional attachment. Since he's not pressuring her to remove all memories but specifically the stains, maybe he's in the right to ask for cleaning. However, if the wife is adamant about keeping it as a memory, forcing the issue might not be fair. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but has a specific issue with the stains, it's more about personal space and cleanliness. So maybe he's not wrong. But the timing of bringing it up might be an issue. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his request is about a specific, tangible thing (cleaning) rather than emotional jealousy. The wife's refusal is her choice, but he's not wrong to ask.\n"
