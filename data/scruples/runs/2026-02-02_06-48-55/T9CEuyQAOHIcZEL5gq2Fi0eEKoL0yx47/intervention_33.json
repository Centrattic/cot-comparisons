I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong for not wanting their wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The situation is that the wife has had the dress in her closet for years, and the husband only became upset after overhearing her and a friend discussing the stains. The wife feels the author is overreacting and not jealous about her past partners, but now he's making an issue about the dress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The husband mentions he's not jealous of her past partners, which suggests he's generally accepting. However, the issue here isn't about past relationships but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The key points are consent and boundaries. Did the wife share the history of the dress with her husband beforehand? It seems she didn't, which might be a point in the husband's favor. He's expressing discomfort with his wife keeping something in the house that he finds unacceptable, even if it's a memory for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a right to her memories and might feel that her husband is overreacting. The question is whether the husband's demand to have it cleaned is reasonable. If the husband is okay with her past relationships but the physical presence of another man's cum in their shared home is a problem for him, it's about personal boundaries. The wife's refusal to clean it despite his request could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut the husband's initial reaction comes after the fact. The dress was there for years without issue. The trigger was the conversation with her friend. The husband's discomfort is valid if he's uneasy about it. However, the wife might feel her autonomy is being challenged. It's a conflict between personal history and current relationship boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The husband is expressing his discomfort, which is understandable. The wife isn't doing anything illegal, just keeping a personal item. But in a relationship, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. If the husband made his feelings known and the wife refuses to accommodate, that could be problematic. However, the wife might feel her right to personal memories is being infringed. \n\nThe husband's main issue isn't the act itself but the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and hygiene concern, perhaps. But the wife doesn't see it that way. The husband's request is about removing something he finds unacceptable, while the wife sees it as a personal memento. \n\nI think the husband is justified in his feelings, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If he's generally accepting but this is a specific boundary, he's not wrong for expressing that. However, if he's overreacting without considering her feelings, maybe he is. The wife's refusal to clean it without discussing it first might be the issue. So, the answer could be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's stating his boundaries, but the wife's dismissal could be problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the author is the husband, the answer might be B (No) because he's asserting his comfort in their shared home.\n"
