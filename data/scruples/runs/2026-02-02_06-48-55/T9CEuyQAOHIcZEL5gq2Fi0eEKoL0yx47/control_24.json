I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the guy is upset because his wife has an old prom dress with cum stains from a previous partner, and he doesn't want it in the house. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has been keeping the dress for a long time and didn't think it was an issue. She has memories attached to it and her friend even saw it. The guy only became upset after hearing the story from his wife and the friend. He's not jealous about her past, but he doesn't want another guy's bodily fluids in their home. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't doing anything wrong by keeping a memento from her past. But the guy is her spouse now, and maybe his feelings are valid too. The question is whether he's overreacting. \n\nCum stains might be a hygiene issue for some people. Even if the wife doesn't mind, the husband might feel uncomfortable. However, the wife didn't clean it because she values the memory. The guy is asking her to clean it for his comfort. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to ask for that? Maybe. He's the one living in the house, and if it's causing him discomfort, he has a right to request it. But the wife might see it as an invasion of her personal history. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the husband isn't jealous of her past partners but is just uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared space, that's a personal preference. The wife is within her rights to keep the dress unless there's a legal or health issue. However, in a marriage, mutual respect and compromise are important. \n\nThe husband's request for cleaning the dress is a reasonable one for his comfort, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The wife is also not in the wrong for valuing her memories. But the husband's reaction might be seen as overstepping if he's trying to control her personal items based on past relationships. \n\nBut considering that he's asking for something that's in their home and he's uncomfortable with it, it's a valid request. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, the husband could have approached it differently, maybe with more sensitivity. \n\nIn the end, it's about personal boundaries. The husband's request is about his comfort in their shared home. The wife's attachment to the dress is about her personal history. Both have valid perspectives, but neither is entirely in the wrong. However, since the husband is expressing his discomfort and asking for a simple solution (cleaning), he's not in the wrong for wanting that. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband isn't wrong for asking. So maybe the answer is B, that he's not in the wrong.\n"
