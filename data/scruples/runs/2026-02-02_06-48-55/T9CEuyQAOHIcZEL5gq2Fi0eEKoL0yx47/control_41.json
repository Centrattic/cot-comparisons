I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author and his wife are married, both 41. They met in college. The wife has an old prom dress that's been in her closet for a long time. The author didn't mind it before. But then, when a friend came over, the wife showed the dress, and the friend noticed spots. The wife explained that her prom date was a mess and that they had sex, leading to cum stains. The author found out later and asked her to get it dry-cleaned because he didn't want another guy's cum in their house. The wife refused, saying he's overreacting and that he shouldn't be jealous. The author is now feeling awkward because the dress is still there.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. He's not jealous about her past partners, but this specific issue with the cum-stained dress is making him uncomfortable. He's asking her to clean it, not because he's jealous of the past, but because of the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a hygiene or personal comfort issue rather than jealousy. \n\nFrom the wife's side, she has memories attached to the dress and doesn't want to get rid of them. She's saying the author is overreacting. She's not hiding the dress, and she's being open about the stains when showing it to friends. She's also pointing out that the author never had an issue before, which might be true.\n\nNow, considering societal norms. Some people might think the author is being overly sensitive. Others might say that since it's in their home, he has the right to feel uncomfortable about that. However, the wife has the right to keep personal items she cherishes. But the author's request is about cleaning it for hygiene reasons, which is reasonable. The wife is refusing, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's making a request based on personal discomfort about something that's in their shared home, isn't it reasonable to ask her to clean it? On the other hand, if the wife is not willing to comply, maybe the author needs to accept it, but the issue is whether his request is valid. \n\nAnother angle: The dress was a part of her past, and the author is not objecting to her having that memory but to the physical presence of the stains. It's not about the memories but the disgust at bodily fluids. That's a common reaction. However, the wife is not in the wrong for wanting to keep the dress. \n\nSo, is the author being unreasonable by not allowing the dress to be there? If the wife is not keeping it in a way that's affecting the author's health or safety, maybe the author is overstepping. But if the author is genuinely uncomfortable, it's a matter of personal boundaries. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified in his request. The dress is in their home, and he has a right to feel that certain things are unhygienic. But the wife might have a right to her memories. \n\nIn some cases, people might side with the author because bodily fluids from others in the home can be a concern. Others might say the author should let it go since it's in the past and not a current issue. \n\nI think the key points are: The author isn't jealous of her past, just the physical presence of the stains. The wife is not hiding the dress or the fact that it's stained. The author's request is about cleaning for hygiene. The wife is refusing. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, if the author is making a reasonable request for something that's in their shared home, and the wife is refusing without a valid reason, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the wife has the right to keep her personal items, even if they're unhygienic, then maybe the author is overstepping. \n\nBut cum stains can be unhygienic and might pose health risks, so asking to clean them is a valid request. However, the wife might not see it the same way. \n\nI think this is a judgment call. If the author's request is about health, then it's valid. If it's about being uncomfortable, maybe not. Since the author states he's not jealous, it's more about the physical presence. \n\nSo the answer could be B (author is not in the wrong) because he's making a request based on hygiene and personal comfort in their shared home. The wife's refusal doesn't negate his right to feel that way. However, some might argue that it's her personal item and he shouldn't be dictating its hygiene, but since it's in their home, the author has a point.\n"
