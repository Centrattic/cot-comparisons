I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA - Am I the Asshole). The situation involves a wife who has an old prom dress with stains that are likely semen from a past partner. The husband becomes uncomfortable when he hears his wife mention the stains and asks her to get it dry-cleaned. She refuses, saying he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main issue isn't the fact that his wife had sex before, which he's stated he's not jealous about. His problem is the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. From a health and cleanliness perspective, some people might find that a valid concern. However, the wife sees it as part of her personal memories and doesn't want to erase them, even if it makes her husband uncomfortable. \n\nNow, societal norms play a role here. In many relationships, partners respect each other's past, but there's also a line when it comes to shared living spaces. The husband isn't upset about the sexual history itself but the physical presence of the stains. It's about personal boundaries and what one is comfortable with in their home. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that these are part of her memories, and she's not doing anything wrong by keeping the dress. The husband's request is about maintaining a clean environment, which is a reasonable expectation in a home. However, the wife feels it's overstepping her personal autonomy. \n\nLegally, there's no law against keeping a stained dress, so the husband's request isn't about legality but about personal comfort. Emotionally, both sides have valid points. The husband might feel that by not cleaning it, the wife is being dismissive of his feelings, while the wife might feel he's being overly controlling or jealous beyond what's necessary.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The husband expressed his discomfort, and the wife dismissed it, which can lead to tension. The question is whether the husband overstepped by making the request. If the wife's keeping the dress is causing him significant distress, it's a point of contention that needs resolution. However, if the husband's request is unreasonable or if he's being controlling, that's another angle.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, often the determination hinges on whether the request is reasonable and respectful. Here, the husband isn't asking for the dress to be destroyed, just cleaned. It's a health/sanitation issue for him, which is a reasonable concern. The wife, however, is prioritizing her memories over his comfort. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The husband isn't wrong for expressing his discomfort, but the wife's refusal to comply might be seen as dismissive. However, the husband's request is about personal boundaries in their shared home, which is a valid concern. So, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. Alternatively, some might argue that the husband is overreacting because the wife has a right to keep her personal items, even with stains. But from a health perspective, it's understandable. I think the key is whether the request is reasonable. Since the husband isn't asking for the dress to be removed entirely, just cleaned, it's a reasonable request. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, others might see it differently based on the importance of respecting the wife's memories versus the husband's comfort.\n"
