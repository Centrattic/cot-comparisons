I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is married, and his wife has an old prom dress that she's kept for a long time. The issue arose when the wife showed the dress to her friend, and it was mentioned that there were spots from her date \"wading a mess,\" which the user now realizes are cum stains. The user then expressed discomfort about having another man's bodily fluids in their home and asked her to have it dry-cleaned. The wife is upset because she feels like he's being jealous and doesn't want to clean it, saying it's part of her memories.\n\nFirst, let's consider the user's perspective. He's in a committed relationship and now feels uncomfortable knowing there's another man's bodily fluids in their home. Even though he's not jealous about her past partners in general, this specific situation brings up a different kind of discomfort. It's about the physical presence of another person's biological material in their shared living space. That's a valid concern for many people, even if they're not typically possessive or jealous of their partner's past.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is that the dress holds sentimental value and represents a memory from her past. She might see the stains as part of that memory and not want to erase them. She might also feel that her partner is overreacting because he's never had an issue before and is now bringing it up after the fact. The mention of her friend's reaction (\"ew\") might have made the user more aware of the situation, which could explain why he only brought it up later.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries in relationships. In a marriage, both partners should communicate their boundaries and comfort levels. The user's discomfort is about the presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and cleanliness concern for some. The wife, however, might prioritize her emotional attachment to the dress over the user's discomfort. \n\nBut where does the line get drawn? Is it unreasonable for the user to ask for the dress to be cleaned? Or is the wife within her rights to keep the dress as a personal memento? The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the user communicated his discomfort clearly and asked her to clean it, it's reasonable for him to expect that. However, if the wife feels that the dress is important to her and that his request is an overreaction, there's a conflict here.\n\nJealousy could be a factor, but the user insists he's not jealous of her past partners. However, the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home could be a different kind of trigger. It's possible that the user's discomfort is more about the physical aspect rather than emotional jealousy. The wife might perceive it as jealousy, though.\n\nI think the user's main point is about his comfort in their shared space. If he's in a relationship where such cleanliness and health concerns are important to him, it's reasonable to ask her to clean it. However, the wife's right to keep personal items from her past should also be considered. The problem arises because the user is now bringing up a concern that wasn't discussed before. The wife might feel that he's being inconsistent because he never mentioned it before the friend's visit. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user has a valid concern about the presence of another person's bodily fluids, which could be a hygiene issue. The wife has a right to her sentimental items. The fact that the user didn't mention it before might make the wife feel that he's overreacting. However, his request is about something he finds uncomfortable, so it's about personal boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should have discussed his feelings sooner if this was a concern. But since he only became aware of the nature of the stains after the friend's visit, it's understandable that he's bringing it up now. The wife's refusal to clean it might be seen as disregarding his comfort, but she might see it as her right to keep the dress. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If he's now bringing up a concern that wasn't discussed before, especially after being aware of the dress for a long time, maybe he's overreacting. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, then it's a reasonable request. The answer might depend on how the couple communicates and respects each other's boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his discomfort is valid regarding the presence of another person's bodily fluids in their home. However, it's important to note that communication and mutual respect are crucial here. The wife might need to consider her partner's feelings if they are married, but the user isn't necessarily wrong in asking for the dress to be cleaned.\n"
