I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe setup is that the wife and husband have been together a long time, but she's had past partners. She has this old prom dress that's been in her closet. The issue comes up when her friend comments on the stains, and the wife explains it was her date who messed up the dress. The husband then confronts her about not wanting the cum stains in the house, and she refuses to clean it, saying he's jealous and overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home, while the wife sees it as a part of her memories and history. He wants it cleaned, she doesn't. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's not jealous about her past, but he's upset about the physical presence of another man's semen in their home. Is that a valid concern? Well, even if he's not jealous, maybe he's uncomfortable with hygiene or just the idea of another person's bodily fluids in a shared space. From a health standpoint, maybe there's a risk of disease, but since it's an old dress that's been stored for years, that's probably not the main issue. It's more about personal comfort and boundaries.\n\nOn the wife's side, she's valuing her memories and the emotional attachment to the dress. She might see it as part of her history and not want to alter it. She's also dismissive of his feelings, calling him jealous and overreacting, which could indicate she doesn't see his discomfort as valid.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not jealous but just uncomfortable with the stains, is that a legitimate reason for conflict? In relationships, both partners' feelings need to be respected. The husband is expressing his discomfort, and the wife isn't acknowledging that, insisting on keeping the dress as is. \n\nHowever, the wife isn't violating any rules they had about past relationships, so the husband's objection is about something specific to the dress itself. Maybe the issue is about communication and mutual respect. The husband is trying to express his boundaries, and the wife isn't honoring them, which could be her fault. Alternatively, if the husband didn't express this concern before and it's a sudden issue, maybe he's overreacting because he wasn't clear earlier.\n\nBut in the scenario, he says he never gave it any thought before. The trigger was the friend's comment and the wife's casual mention of it. It's possible that the husband's discomfort is valid, and he's entitled to feel that way. However, the wife's refusal to clean it, despite his feelings, might be the problem here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both need to communicate and find a solution. If the husband is the one bringing it up and the wife is refusing to accommodate his request, perhaps the wife is at fault. But the husband might also need to consider why he's so upset\u2014maybe there's an underlying jealousy he's not acknowledging. However, the user's initial thought is that the author (husband) is in the wrong, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the user says they think the author is wrong but want my opinion. Let me check again. The husband's argument is that he doesn't want his house to have another man's cum. The wife's argument is about her memories and says he's overreacting. If he's not jealous, just about the physical presence, maybe his request is reasonable. But if the dress has been there for years without issue, maybe he's overreacting now. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nBut considering that he's expressing his discomfort and the wife isn't respecting that, maybe the wife is in the wrong. However, the question is about the husband's actions. If he's the one making the demand, and the wife is resisting, perhaps the husband isn't in the wrong if his request is about cleanliness or his own comfort in their home. But if the issue is about past relationships and not about the physical presence, then maybe he is overstepping. However, the text says he's not jealous of her past partners, just the stains.\n\nI think the key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's not imposing rules about her past but about the physical object in their home, his stance could be valid. The wife not respecting his request might be the issue. But maybe the husband is overreacting because it's an old dress and the stain is from years ago. It's a matter of differing values. However, in terms of whose in the wrong, if the husband is trying to communicate his boundaries and the wife isn't honoring them, maybe the wife is at fault. But the user's initial thought is the opposite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is right to express his discomfort, but the wife is right to hold onto her memories. It's a conflict of values. But the question is about who is wrong. In relationships, both partners have to compromise. If the husband is making a valid request and the wife is refusing without consideration, maybe she's in the wrong. But if the husband is being unreasonable, then he is. It's tricky. I think I need to decide between A and B. The user thinks A (author in wrong), but I'm leaning towards B (not in wrong) because he's expressing his comfort in their home. However, the wife's right to her memories is also a factor. So maybe both have points, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting the stains removed if that's his preference. So answer B.\n"
