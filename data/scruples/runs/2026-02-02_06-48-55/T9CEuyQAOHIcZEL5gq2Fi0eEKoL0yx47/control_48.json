I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband objecting to his wife's prom dress with cum stains from a past partner. The wife says the husband is overreacting and doesn't want to clean it. The husband is uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once someone is married, they have certain property rights. However, the dress is the wife's personal item. Legally, she might have the right to keep it in the house unless there's a lease or ownership agreement that prohibits such things. But legally, it's probably not a big issue.\n\nEthically and emotionally, this is more complex. The husband is uncomfortable with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a valid feeling for him. But the wife is attached to the dress as a memory. The question is about whether the husband is overstepping. \n\nJealousy is a common emotion in relationships, but the husband says he's not jealous of her past partners. However, the issue here is more about the physical presence of another man's cum in their current home. The husband's discomfort might be about hygiene, respect for the space they share, or a sense of boundaries. \n\nThe wife's argument is that it's a memory and she shouldn't have to clean it. But if the husband is uncomfortable, it's reasonable for him to ask her to clean it. However, the wife has the right to her own memories, and the husband might be overreacting if he's only now objecting after having had the dress in the house for years. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The husband has a right to his feelings, but the wife has a right to her memories. The fact that the husband waited a long time to bring it up might suggest it's more about current feelings of jealousy rather than a longstanding issue. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the husband is making a reasonable request for cleanliness and respect in their shared home, he's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's being controlling or demanding that she erase her past, that could be problematic. The wife's refusal to clean it might be her asserting her autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband's request is reasonable and respectful. Since he's asking for the dress to be cleaned for hygiene reasons and not forbidding her from keeping it, he might not be in the wrong. However, if his request is more about jealousy and control, then he might be overstepping. The situation is nuanced, but given the husband's stated reasons (not jealousy, but discomfort with bodily fluids), he might have a valid point. The wife has a right to her memories, but the husband's home environment is also a shared space. It's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. However, since he's asking her to clean it (not to throw it away or restrict her from owning it), he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
