I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The husband is uncomfortable with it, while the wife doesn't want to get it cleaned. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband didn't mind her past relationships before, so jealousy isn't the main issue. He's more concerned about the actual physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a hygiene and comfort issue. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as part of her memories and doesn't want to have it cleaned.\n\nSo, is the husband overreacting? Well, it's a matter of personal boundaries. Even if the husband isn't jealous, he's within his right to be uncomfortable with something like that in their shared living space. The fact that the wife doesn't want to clean it despite his discomfort could be seen as her not respecting his feelings. However, the husband initially didn't care about the dress before the situation came up. Now that he's expressed his discomfort, the wife's refusal might be the issue here.\n\nBut wait, the husband is asking if HE is in the wrong. The question is whether his stance is justified. Since he has the right to feel uncomfortable about bodily fluids from another person in his home, he's not in the wrong for wanting it cleaned. The wife is the one who might be in the wrong for not respecting his wishes once he's communicated them. \n\nBut maybe there's more to it. The wife's argument is about her memories. Should he respect that? It's a balance between respecting each other's feelings. However, the presence of bodily fluids is a health and sanitation issue, which is a valid concern. So, the husband's request is reasonable. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his legitimate concern. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
