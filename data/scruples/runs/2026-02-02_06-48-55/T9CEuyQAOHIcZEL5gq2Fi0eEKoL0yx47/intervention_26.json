I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. The wife is refusing to have it cleaned, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's main issue isn't about jealousy over past relationships but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as a sentimental item with good memories and doesn't want to get rid of the stains because that's part of the memory.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The husband is expressing a discomfort with something in their shared living space. Even if he's not jealous, the idea of another person's bodily fluids in the home can be a hygiene or personal boundary issue. However, the wife's right to keep a personal item, especially one with sentimental value, is also important.\n\nIs the husband overreacting? It depends on their relationship dynamics. If he hasn't had a problem before and this is a new issue, maybe. But the fact that the wife mentioned it in front of him after a friend commented on the stains might have triggered his discomfort. The key here is respecting each other's boundaries. The husband is asking for the dress to be cleaned, which is a reasonable request for hygiene. The wife is refusing, valuing her memory over the husband's comfort.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong for making this a big deal? If they've never had an issue before and this is a new point of contention, it might be seen as overstepping. However, the presence of another person's bodily fluids in the home could be a personal boundary that's being crossed. The wife's refusal to clean it might be disregarding his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could be more sensitive about this than other potential issues. The wife's argument is about memories and not wanting to erase part of her past. It's a conflict between personal history and personal space boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate and find a compromise. The husband's request is valid, but the wife's feelings are also valid. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not being jealous but is concerned about the physical presence of the stains, it's more about personal boundaries. But if the issue is about control or being controlling, then maybe he's overreacting. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Asking for the dress to be cleaned is a reasonable hygiene request, not about the past relationship. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. So, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the wife is entitled to keep her personal item as is, then the husband might be overstepping. But since it's in their shared home, maybe he has a right to request it be cleaned.\n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because his issue is about the physical presence of the stains, not jealousy. The wife's refusal could be the issue here. So answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
