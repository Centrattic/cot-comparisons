I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe husband is upset because his wife's prom dress, which he found out has cum stains from a past partner, is in their home. He wants her to get it cleaned because he's uncomfortable having another man's bodily fluids in their house. The wife is defensive, saying he's overreacting and that the dress has good memories for her. She's not willing to get it cleaned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. The husband says he's not jealous about her past partners, so his issue isn't about jealousy but about the physical presence of someone else's bodily fluids in their home. That's a health and comfort concern. On the other hand, the wife sees the dress as a memory from her past, which she's not willing to part with or alter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a perspective of personal boundaries and shared living space, the husband has a right to be uncomfortable. Bodily fluids in the home can be seen as a health issue, even if it's just a memory. However, the wife's right to her personal memories and items is also valid. But maybe there's a middle ground here. The husband isn't asking to throw it out, just to clean it, which is a reasonable request for hygiene reasons.\n\nThe wife's response is dismissive, calling him jealous and not considering his discomfort. That might indicate she's not respecting his feelings. The husband's stance is about cleanliness and comfort in their shared home, which is a legitimate concern. If it's a shared space, both partners should agree on what's acceptable. The wife's refusal to clean it despite the husband's discomfort might make her the one in the wrong, but the question is about the husband's actions.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The husband's request is reasonable, as he's not trying to erase her past but just to maintain a clean home. The wife's refusal to comply could be the issue, but does that make the husband wrong? Or is the husband overstepping by insisting on cleaning a personal item of hers? Maybe there's a cultural aspect here. Some people might find it odd to keep a prom dress with such stains, while others see it as a personal memento. The husband's discomfort is valid, but is it his place to dictate how she handles her own memories? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband expressed his feelings, but the wife isn't willing to compromise. The husband's position is about hygiene, which is a valid concern in a shared home. The wife's resistance could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. So perhaps the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's asserting his comfort in their shared space, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal might be the issue, but the question is about the husband. So, based on the information, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his request is about maintaining a clean home and his personal boundaries, which are valid.\n"
