I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife having a prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband not wanting it in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is uncomfortable with the stains, even though he's not jealous of her past. He wants it cleaned because it's another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife, on the other hand, has good memories associated with the dress and doesn't want to clean it, possibly seeing it as part of her history.\n\nMarriage involves mutual respect and compromise. The husband's discomfort is about something that's in their shared living space. Even if he's not jealous, he has a right to his feelings about having another man's bodily fluids in their home. The wife might think it's trivial, but it's a valid concern for him. However, the wife's right to keep personal mementos is also important. \n\nThe key points are boundaries and respect. The husband isn't trying to control her past but wants his home to be clean in a literal and metaphorical sense. The wife might feel that her personal memories are being dismissed. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have to accommodate each other's needs and boundaries. If the husband is not jealous but still uncomfortable with the physical presence of another man's residue, that's his right. The wife might need to consider his feelings here. However, the husband shouldn't be in the wrong for having a legitimate boundary. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
