I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife's prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about it being in the house. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the husband didn't care about his wife's past, but now he's upset about the physical remnants (cum stains) in their home. The wife doesn't want to get it cleaned because of her memories, while the husband wants it cleaned for his comfort. They've had arguments since.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. Both have the right to their feelings. The husband's discomfort is valid because it's his home, and he's uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids there. However, the wife's attachment to her memories is also valid. The question is whether the husband overreacted or if he's within his rights to ask for it to be cleaned.\n\nThe husband isn't being jealous of the past partner but is uncomfortable with the physical presence. That's different from possessiveness. He's not trying to control her memories but her current living space. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her husband is being overly controlling about her personal items and memories.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, he's the one living in the house and can request items that make him uncomfortable to be removed or cleaned. Emotionally, the wife's stance is about her memories. However, the husband isn't wrong in expressing his discomfort. The problem is that the wife isn't complying, leading to tension.\n\nIn many relationships, partners have to make compromises. The husband's request is reasonable if it's making him uncomfortable, but the wife's refusal might be seen as not respecting his feelings. However, the husband could have approached it more sensitively, maybe discussing it before confronting her about it after the friend left.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's accurate. Some might argue that he's overreacting because it's a memory and not an active issue. Others might side with him because it's his home and he has the right to be comfortable. \n\nConsidering all angles, the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort. He has the right to request that the item be cleaned if it's in his home and causing him distress. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
