I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding his wife's prom dress with cum stains. The husband is upset that the dress is in the house, even though he's not jealous of her past. His wife is keeping it for sentimental reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's asking for the dress to be cleaned because he's uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in the house. That's a reasonable health and cleanliness concern. Even if the wife has good memories, it's about their shared living space. The husband isn't objecting to her past relationships, just the physical remains of that night.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see the dress as a personal memento. She's not keeping it to provoke him, but as part of her history. She might feel that her memories are her own and that the husband's request is overstepping. However, once they're married, they share a home, and both have a right to their comfort level. The husband's request is about the state of their home, not her past.\n\nThe wife's refusal to clean it could be seen as dismissing his feelings. Even if she doesn't want to part with the dress, she could compromise by having it dry-cleaned, which might remove the stains while preserving the dress. The husband isn't asking her to get rid of it, just to clean it. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? He's not jealous but concerned about the presence of bodily fluids. That's a valid health concern. The wife's stance might be about her memories, but in a shared home, both partners need to respect each other's comfort. The husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution that maintains hygiene without destroying the dress.\n"
