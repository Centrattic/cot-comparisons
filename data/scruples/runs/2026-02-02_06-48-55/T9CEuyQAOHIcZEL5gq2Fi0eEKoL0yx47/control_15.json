I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife has an old prom dress with cum stains from a past partner, and the husband is upset about having that in the house. They've tried to talk about it, but she's not cleaning it, and he's still uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main issue is not the fact that she had sex in the past, which he says he's not jealous about. His problem is specifically with the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home. That seems like a personal boundary he has. On the other hand, the wife has emotional memories attached to that night and the dress, and she doesn't want to get rid of it. She might feel like her memories are being invalidated or that he's being overly critical.\n\nNow, legally, there's no issue here. It's a private matter between them. But morally or socially, is he wrong? Well, he's expressing discomfort about something that's not his to control. The dress is hers, and she has the right to keep it if she wants. However, if he's living in the same house, maybe he has a right to be comfortable in his own home. But at the same time, the wife's right to her memories and personal history is important too.\n\nHe mentioned he's not jealous of her past partners, so his issue isn't with her past but with the physical reminder. That might be about his own boundaries and maybe a sense of cleanliness or privacy. But if he didn't have a problem before, why is he bringing it up now? The friend's comment might have triggered it, making him realize he's uncomfortable. However, she's not cleaning it, which could be causing ongoing tension.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He tried to talk to her, but she's dismissing his feelings as jealousy. Maybe he's overreacting because it's an old issue that's been brought to light. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable, is he in the wrong for asking her to clean it? Or is she in the wrong for not respecting his request?\n\nI think the key here is whether his request is reasonable. If the dress is in her closet, and the stains are not a health hazard or causing any practical issue, then maybe his request is about his personal comfort rather than something that affects their shared life. On the flip side, if it's making him uncomfortable in their home, maybe she should consider his feelings, even if the dress has sentimental value. However, she has the right to her own memories and might not see the stains as a problem now that they're in the past.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not in the wrong, then answer B. But if he's overstepping by making a demand about her personal item, maybe A. But the question is whether he's wrong for not wanting the stains in his house. Since it's his house too, he has a right to his comfort. But the dress is hers. It's a bit of a conflict between personal boundaries. I think the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because he's expressing his discomfort about something that's in their shared living space. But others might argue that it's her dress and her past. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong because he's communicating his feelings and it's reasonable to want his home to be a comfortable space. However, the wife's right to her memories is also valid. Maybe the issue is more about how they're handling the communication rather than who is morally wrong. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then he's not wrong for wanting it cleaned. If it's A, then he is wrong for overreacting. Given that he's not jealous, but just doesn't want the physical reminder, I think B is the answer.\n"
