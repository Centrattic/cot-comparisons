I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has had this dress in her closet for a long time, and the author hadn't minded it until now. The issue arose when the dress was shown to a friend, and the wife mentioned the stains from her ex-date. The author then confronts her about not wanting the stains in the house, but the wife is resistant, saying it's her memory and he's being jealous.\n\nHmm. So the author is uncomfortable with another man's bodily fluids in their home. That's a personal boundary he's set. But the wife feels it's her memory and doesn't want to clean it, which she frames as the author being jealous. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author has a right to be uncomfortable with bodily fluids from someone else. It's a matter of hygiene and personal space. On the other hand, the wife has a right to her own memories and the emotional attachment to the dress. She hasn't done anything to intentionally make him uncomfortable before, so the sudden reaction might seem like overstepping. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't objecting to her past relationships or the memory itself. He's specifically about the physical presence of another man's cum in their home. That's a different issue. Even if you respect someone's past, you might have a boundary about certain things being in your shared living space. \n\nHowever, the wife's reaction is that the author is being jealous where he shouldn't be. But the author isn't jealous of the relationship itself, just the physical remnants. The problem is that the wife isn't willing to compromise, even though the author has expressed discomfort. \n\nI think this is a matter of differing boundaries. The author is asserting his own comfort level, which is valid. The wife is clinging to her memory, which is also valid. But when they cohabit, they need to respect each other's boundaries. If the author finds the presence of another man's bodily fluids unacceptable, the wife should consider cleaning it to respect his feelings. Conversely, the author might need to be more understanding that the dress is part of her history. \n\nBut the key point is that the author isn't asking her to remove the dress entirely, just to clean it. That's a reasonable request. The wife's refusal to clean it despite the author's discomfort might be the problem here. So, is the author wrong for setting that boundary? Or is the wife wrong for not respecting it?\n\nI think the author is within his rights to set that boundary. If two people live together, they should negotiate what's acceptable. The author's discomfort is about a physical object in their shared home, not about the wife's past. So he's not being jealous of the past relationship, just about the current presence of another man's fluids. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting it cleaned. The wife's refusal to comply is where the issue lies, but the question is about the author's stance. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
