I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong regarding his wife's prom dress with another guy's cum stains. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband found out that his wife's prom dress has stains from a previous sexual encounter. He's uncomfortable keeping it in the house and wants it cleaned, but the wife refuses, saying he's overreacting and that these are her good memories. The husband isn't jealous about her past but doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in his home. The wife is upset and they're having tension.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The husband's perspective is about personal discomfort and possibly a boundary he's crossing regarding his home. He's not being jealous about her past but about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids. On the other hand, the wife sees it as a cherished memory and feels her husband is overstepping by demanding it be cleaned. \n\nLegal or social norms? There's no law against having a stained dress as a memory. It's more about personal boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband has the right to a clean home, but the wife has the right to her memories. The problem is they have conflicting needs here. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? Some might say yes; he's in his home and doesn't want another person's bodily fluids there. Others might argue that the wife has the right to keep her memories, even if they're uncomfortable for her spouse. However, the key here is that the husband didn't have an issue before the conversation came up. He only became uncomfortable after finding out. \n\nJealousy vs. personal boundary. The wife accuses him of being jealous, but he says he's not. However, his reaction is about the physical presence of the stains. If he's not jealous of her past, then maybe it's about cleanliness. But the term \"cumstains\" adds a layer of intimacy and sexual history that might be more than just a stain. \n\nCommunication is a big issue here. The husband didn't address the issue until after the friend left, which might have been a surprise to the wife. She felt he was overreacting because he never mentioned it before. The wife's refusal to clean it shows she values the memory more than his discomfort. \n\nIs the husband wrong for wanting it cleaned? It's a matter of perspective. If they can't resolve this through compromise, like maybe the wife keeps the dress in a different location or they agree on some terms, but the husband's stance is about personal preference. However, in a shared home, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The wife might need to respect the husband's desire for cleanliness, or the husband might need to accept her need to keep the memory. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's not being jealous and is simply stating his discomfort with the stains, then maybe not. However, if the wife feels her memories are being dismissed, that's a problem. The husband's insistence without compromise could make him wrong. But since he's stating his preference, maybe it's a matter of negotiation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the line is crossed when one is being overly controlling or jealous. Here, the husband is not controlling the wife's past but her physical property in their home. The wife's refusal to clean might be seen as her right, but the husband's right to a clean home isn't trivial. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and wanting the dress cleaned, but the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep her memory. However, since they can't agree, maybe the husband is in the right to express his preference, but the wife is also in the right to keep her dress. The problem is that they aren't compromising. But according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his request is reasonable. If he's not being jealous but wants the stain gone, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's being controlling, then yes. \n\nGiven the information, he's not being jealous but is unsettled by the presence of another man's bodily fluids. That's a reasonable discomfort for some people. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's stating his boundary. However, the wife's feelings about her memory are valid too. But in terms of right or wrong, he's not wrong for having that boundary.\n"
