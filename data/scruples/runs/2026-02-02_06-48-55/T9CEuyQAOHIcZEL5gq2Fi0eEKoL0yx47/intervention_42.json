I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is upset about his wife's prom dress, which has stains from another guy's sexual fluids. He wants her to get it dry cleaned, but she refuses, saying he's being jealous and overreacting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, from the husband's perspective, maybe he's uncomfortable with having another man's bodily fluids in the house. That's a common concern in relationships, especially if you're married and maybe have hygiene or personal space issues. But on the other hand, the wife is holding onto a memory from her past, which she seems to value. She's not doing anything to harm him directly, just keeping the dress as a memento.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. Jealousy is a personal thing. If the husband isn't jealous about her past partners in general, but this specific situation is bothering him, maybe it's about his personal boundaries. However, the wife has a right to her memories. But if the husband is living with her, he's living in the same space, so maybe he has a valid point about not wanting bodily fluids in his home. \n\nBut then, is it about jealousy? The husband says he doesn't care that she had sex with other guys, but the stains are the issue. That seems more about cleanliness and discomfort with bodily fluids rather than jealousy. Still, the wife is entitled to her memories, but maybe the husband's request is reasonable. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. She's an adult, and the dress is her personal item. The husband might be overstepping by making a big deal about it, especially since she's been keeping it for a long time without issue. The fact that he only brought it up after the friend's visit might be a factor too. \n\nI think the key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. If he's not okay with the presence of another man's bodily fluids in their home, that's a valid concern. But the wife's right to her personal memories is also valid. It's a conflict between personal comfort and personal history. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband might need to express his discomfort in a way that respects her feelings. But if the wife is unwilling to budge, maybe the husband is overreacting. Alternatively, maybe the husband has the right to his boundaries in their shared home. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the husband's request is about hygiene and personal space. On the other, the wife's memories are important to her. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the husband is making her feel guilty for holding onto something meaningful, that's a problem. But if he's simply stating his preference, it's a mutual respect issue. \n\nI think the husband isn't wrong for being uncomfortable, but maybe he's in the wrong if he's being controlling or overbearing. The wife has the right to her personal items unless they pose a health risk. Since it's an old dress in a closet, maybe the husband's concern is more about emotional discomfort than actual harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the husband being in the wrong because it's her dress and her memory, and unless there's a health issue, it's more about his personal discomfort. The wife has the right to her personal belongings and her past.\n"
