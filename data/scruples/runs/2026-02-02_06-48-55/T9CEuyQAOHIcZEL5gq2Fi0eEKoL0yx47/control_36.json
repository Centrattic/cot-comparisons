I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife who has a prom dress with cum stains from her ex-date, and her husband is uncomfortable with it being in their home. The wife is resistant to having it cleaned, saying it's part of her memories and that the husband shouldn't be jealous. The husband feels that even though he's not jealous about her past, he doesn't want another man's bodily fluids in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband's discomfort is about the physical presence of another man's bodily fluids in their shared space. The wife is attached to the dress for sentimental reasons and sees the husband's request as jealousy, which he denies. The question is whether his stance is valid or if he's overstepping.\n\nLegally, the husband has a right to a clean and safe home. However, this is more of a social and emotional issue. The wife's perspective is that the dress is a memory, which is valid. The husband's discomfort is about personal boundaries and health concerns. The wife's refusal to clean the dress could be seen as disregarding those boundaries, but she has a right to her own memories and may not see the stains as a problem.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The husband expressed his discomfort, but the wife isn't budging. It's possible that the husband is overreacting, especially since he's not jealous but just wants the stains removed. On the other hand, the wife's attachment to the dress might be too strong to let go of it. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Dry cleaning to remove the stains is a practical solution, not an erasure of memories, just a hygiene issue. The wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings, but she's not obligated to clean it if it's important to her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting the stains removed, especially if it's affecting his comfort in their home. However, the wife's refusal isn't necessarily wrong either because she's entitled to her memories. The issue might be more about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the husband can't accept her decision, maybe the problem is deeper. But based on the scenario, the husband's request is reasonable, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
