I\u2019m not jealous about her past partners. She has had her old prom dress hanging in the back of her closet forever. I\u2019ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife\u2019s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says \u201cI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.\u201d She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment \u201coh, no, it has spots on it\u201d and my wife says \u201coh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.\u201d The friend says \u201cew!\u201d And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says \u201cI loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo\u201d. I said \u201chey, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with another guy\u2019s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned\u201d she said \u201cwhat! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don\u2019t be jealous, I won\u2019t have it cleaned.\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care that you had sex with other guys, I don\u2019t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don\u2019t want another guy\u2019s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.\u201d She said \u201cno, you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d \nIt\u2019s been awkward ever since. It\u2019s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet \u201care you going to get that dress cleaned?\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t think so, don\u2019t be jealous\u201d. I have talked with her since. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife's prom dress with another man's cum stains in their house. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The wife has had this dress in her closet for a long time. The author wasn't bothered before but now brings up the issue after hearing the story from the wife's friend. The wife is defensive, says he's jealous, and refuses to clean it. The author wants it cleaned for hygienic reasons, not out of jealousy, and the wife is upset that he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's main argument is about hygiene and not wanting another person's bodily fluids in the house. That's a reasonable concern. The wife, on the other hand, views the dress as a memory and doesn't want it cleaned. She also mentions that the author never cared before, which might make her feel like he's bringing it up now for reasons other than hygiene, perhaps jealousy.\n\nBut the author clarifies he's not jealous of her past but just wants the stains gone. However, the wife sees it as overreacting and jealousy. The problem here is the conflict between personal boundaries and the wife's emotional attachment to the dress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for having a boundary about bodily fluids in the home. It's a matter of health and personal space. The wife is also within her rights to hold onto a meaningful item unless there's a mutual agreement on such matters. However, since the author is asking if he's wrong, and given that he's not being jealous but rather setting a boundary, he's not in the wrong. The wife might need to consider her partner's feelings here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
