It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by inviting his mom to stay without his wife's consent, given the domestic issues they're facing.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the division of housework. The author mentions that his wife isn't contributing much since the birth of their child, and he's handling most of it, leading to burnout. He tried communicating with her but she's not willing to help. His mom offered to help, but the wife was against it. The author then went ahead and invited his mom anyway.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author's intention was to alleviate his stress and help with the workload. However, he did this without considering his wife's feelings. The wife was upset and felt undermined, especially when the friend pointed out the author's actions. The key here is communication. Even though the wife wasn't helping, the author didn't address this conflict properly. He didn't try to resolve it through dialogue, which could have led to a mutual agreement. Instead, he acted unilaterally, which might have been seen as disrespectful to his wife's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clearly stressed and needed support. His mom's help did provide some relief. However, the method of inviting his mom without consent could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. In a marriage, making major decisions without the spouse's input can lead to resentment, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. From a relationship advice perspective, communication is key. The author should have discussed the situation more thoroughly with his wife before taking such a step. Even if the wife was not helpful, involving his mom without her agreement could damage their relationship further. The wife's reaction indicates that her feelings were hurt, which the author might not have considered. So, while the author's actions were driven by his need for help, the approach could be seen as flawed because it didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), not because inviting help was wrong, but because the method of doing it without his wife's consent was disrespectful and could have been handled better through open communication.\n"
