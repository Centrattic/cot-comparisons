It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author invited their mom to stay with them after having a baby because their wife isn't helping with housework, and the wife was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: they're working 45 hours a week, which is manageable, but after work, they're doing almost all the housework. The wife says she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby. The author tried to communicate their struggles, but the wife didn't help. Then the author invited their mom without the wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's side: maybe she's overwhelmed with the baby, especially in the early months. Postpartum fatigue is real. The author's actions might have been a reaction to their own exhaustion, but did they consider the wife's feelings? Inviting a parent without the spouse's consent can be a big deal, even if the parent is willing to help. It disrupts the household dynamics and might make the wife feel disrespected or undermined.\n\nThe mom's involvement: she offered help, and the author accepted. The wife was upset, so the mom's coldness and possessiveness of the baby could be a reaction to the wife's anger. The author's friends might have noticed the tension and commented on it, indicating that the wife's feelings were hurt.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and consent. The author tried to arrange it with the wife, but when the wife refused, they went ahead anyway. That's where the problem might lie. Even if the author felt desperate, involving their mom without the wife's agreement could be seen as overstepping. The wife might feel that her ability to handle the situation was being questioned, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of shared responsibility. The author is doing 80/20 of the housework, which is a lot. The wife's not contributing beyond baby-related tasks. The author's actions might be justified by the need for support, but the method of getting that support (without consulting the wife) could be the issue.\n\nIn AITA contexts, respect for boundaries and communication are often emphasized. So while the author's struggle is understandable, inviting their mom without the wife's permission might be where they're in the wrong. The wife's friend also pointed out the undermining, which suggests that the action was not well-received and could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they bypassed their wife's wishes and brought in their mom without mutual agreement, which could be seen as not respecting their wife's autonomy, even if they were struggling.\n"
