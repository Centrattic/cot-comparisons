It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by bringing their mom to stay with their wife and baby without the wife's permission. The situation is that the author feels overwhelmed with both work and all the housework since the birth of their child. The wife isn't contributing much, and after some conflict, the author invites their mom to help, which upsets the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: they're working long hours, doing all the housework, and feeling burnt out. They tried to communicate with their wife, who doesn't help. The mom offered to help, so the author brings her in to relieve the stress. It's understandable that they're stressed and need support.\n\nOn the wife's side, she's also dealing with the baby, which is exhausting. She might feel that her husband isn't respecting her exhaustion or that bringing in the mom is a slight against her ability to handle things. The wife's reaction is anger, which suggests she might feel disrespected or undermined. The author's action of inviting the mom without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention was good.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author did try to talk to the wife first, but when that didn't work, they went ahead. Communication is key in relationships, and the author's decision to proceed without consensus might have caused more harm. The wife's friend's comment about undermining the wife points to the potential harm in the author's action, even if the intention was to help.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context of their communication. The author felt they had no choice after trying to communicate, but the method of resolving the issue without the wife's input could be problematic. The wife's feelings are valid too; she might feel that her husband is taking sides or not supporting her in her role as a new mother. The author's mom's presence might also affect the wife's bonding with the baby, adding another layer of tension.\n\nIn relationships, collaboration is important. The author could have sought couples counseling or other forms of support instead of bringing in their mom. The action might have been a solution to the author's stress but created a rift in the relationship. So, while the author's intentions were good, the approach may have been wrong.\n"
