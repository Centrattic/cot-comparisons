It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for bringing his mom to stay with his wife and him after having a baby, despite the wife being upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main issue is the division of household chores. The author mentions that even before the baby, the wife was doing less, but now, since the baby's arrival, she's doing almost nothing. The author is working 45 hours a week, coming home exhausted, and handling all the housework. He tried asking for help, but the wife is also exhausted from taking care of the baby. \n\nThen, the author's mom offered to come help for a couple of weeks. The author went to his wife first, but she was angry and said they could handle it. The author then informed his wife that he would bring his mom if things didn't improve, which they didn't. So he brought his mom in without his wife's permission. Now, the wife is upset, and the mom is being cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is overwhelmed, trying to manage work, housework, and the baby. His mom's help could be necessary for his well-being. On the other hand, without consulting his wife, bringing in a parent might disrupt their relationship and show a lack of respect for her autonomy and feelings.\n\nKey points to consider: communication between the couple, the wife's perspective, the impact of the mom's arrival. Did the author communicate his needs effectively? He did try to talk to his wife and ask for help. But when that failed, bringing in his mom without her consent could be seen as undermining her. Also, the wife might feel that her efforts (even if minimal) are being ignored, or that her partner isn't supporting her emotionally. The author's decision might have been necessary for his health but could have been handled better. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to alleviate his stress, but the method might have been disrespectful. Maybe he should have found another solution or sought couples counseling. However, in some cultures, extended family support is common and expected. The wife's reaction could also be influenced by other factors not mentioned here, like her own stress or feelings of being criticized.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing in the mom without the wife's consent might be the author's misstep. Even if he had a valid reason, involving family in such a way without mutual agreement could create more problems. The wife's friend's comment suggests that the action was perceived as undermining the wife. So, the author might share some responsibility here for not resolving the issue within the couple first.\n"
