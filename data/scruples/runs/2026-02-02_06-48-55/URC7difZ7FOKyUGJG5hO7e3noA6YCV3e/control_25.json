It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after having a baby, despite the wife's initial refusal. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The husband and wife had a housework imbalance before the baby, which got worse after the child was born. The husband works 45 hours, comes home exhausted, does all the housework and childcare, while the wife is too tired to help. The husband tried communicating, but the wife refused help. Then he invited his mom to help, which the wife was upset about.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is at fault. The core issue is about family responsibilities and communication. The husband felt overwhelmed and tried to get help, which he did after the wife didn't change her behavior. However, he did it without the wife's consent after she had rejected the idea. \n\nOn one hand, the husband was trying to solve a problem that was affecting his well-being and their household. He did try to talk to his wife first and gave her a week to change, which is a reasonable step. But then he went ahead without her agreement, which might have caused more conflict. The wife felt disrespected and undermined, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife wasn't contributing, and the husband was burnt out. The mom's help provided necessary support. However, involving a third party without the wife's consent could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent was good. \n\nI need to consider if there's a cultural context. In some cultures, involving family for childcare is common. The husband's mom offered help, and the wife's friend commented on the husband's action. But the main conflict is the lack of communication and respect for the wife's feelings. \n\nThe husband might have a valid point about needing help, but his approach of bypassing his wife's wishes could be seen as disrespectful. The right approach would be to find a compromise or seek couples counseling instead of unilaterally making a decision. \n\nSo, while the husband's situation is understandable, the method he used might be where he's in the wrong. The answer could be A (Yes) because he didn't handle the communication properly, but some might argue B (No) because he was trying to address a serious issue. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the act of inviting his mom without considering the wife's feelings could make him at fault.\n"
