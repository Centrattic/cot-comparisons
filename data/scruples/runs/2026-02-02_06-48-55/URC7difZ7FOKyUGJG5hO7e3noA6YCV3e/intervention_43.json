It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (AITA) inviting his mom to stay after his wife isn't helping with housework since having a baby. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The wife used to split housework 65/35 in his favor but now does almost none. The author is working 45 hours a week and is exhausted from work and doing all the chores. He tried to ask his wife for help, but she says she's too tired. He then asked his mom, who lives far away, to come help. When he told his wife, she got angry and refused. The author then proceeded to invite his mom anyway after a week with no change, leading to his wife being upset and their relationship deteriorating.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly overwhelmed, and the wife isn't contributing as she used to. He's doing all the housework and taking care of the baby, which is a lot. His mom offered help, which could alleviate some stress. \n\nHowever, the issue is that the author went around his wife to invite his mom. Even though the wife was resistant, communication is key in a marriage. The author tried to talk to her but when she didn't respond, he took action without resolving the conflict. That could be seen as undermining her, especially since they were already having issues. The wife's reaction was anger, which might stem from feeling disrespected or not being part of the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be justified if he felt that the situation was unsustainable. The wife's lack of contribution is affecting their relationship and his well-being. Bringing in his mom provided necessary support, and the author might have felt that his mental health and the family's stability depended on it. \n\nBut the way he did it\u2014without discussing it further or finding a compromise\u2014could be problematic. The wife might have felt that her autonomy was disregarded. It's possible that the author didn't fully address her perspective or try to understand why she wasn't contributing. Maybe she was dealing with postpartum issues or other stressors that weren't communicated. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the answer isn't black and white. The author had valid reasons for needing help, but the method of involving his mom without resolving the conflict with his wife first might be where he went wrong. The wife's feelings of being undermined by the friend's comment also highlights the tension. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in a tough spot. He's trying to manage a heavy workload and family responsibilities, but the approach he took might have been hasty. The better approach would have been to seek couples counseling or find another way to address the imbalance in their relationship before involving his mother. Therefore, while the author's intent was to get help, the method of doing so without resolving the marital conflict could make him at least partially at fault.\n"
