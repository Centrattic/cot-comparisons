It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The main issue is that the wife isn't doing her share of the housework. Before the baby, it was a 65/35 split, but now she's doing almost none. The author works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted. He's handling all the housework, and the wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. They tried to talk about it, but she's not helping. Then the author's mom offers to come help, which he's grateful for. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and says they don't need help. The author then proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly overwhelmed, doing all the work, and feeling burnt out. The wife's response is that she's too tired, which might be valid because caring for a newborn is demanding. But maybe she's not contributing as much as she could. The author tried to communicate, but the wife didn't respond positively. So when he brings in his mom without her consent, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? Well, bringing in family help without the spouse's permission could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy. The wife might feel disrespected or undermined. However, the author was at his breaking point and felt he had no other option. The question is whether his actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the author's mom was trying to help, and the author felt he needed support. On the other hand, involving a parent without discussing it properly with the spouse can create tension and resentment. The wife's friend points out that the author undermined her, which suggests that his actions were perceived as disrespectful.\n\nBut the root problem is the unequal distribution of labor. The author tried to address it but didn't get the support he needed. So while the method of bringing in the mom might be questionable, the underlying issue is the lack of cooperation from the wife. The author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it better by having a more thorough conversation with his wife first. However, since the wife was resistant to help and the situation was unsustainable, the author's decision to seek help might be understandable.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author acted unilaterally without considering his wife's feelings, which he did. He told her mom to come anyway after she refused, which could be seen as dismissive of her wishes. However, given the exhaustion and lack of resolution, maybe it's a necessary step. But in terms of right or wrong, the act of bringing in the mom without her consent is generally not advisable. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the situation is complex. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the unilateral decision might make the author at fault.\n"
