It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the author is doing all the housework while the wife is doing almost none. He mentions that even before the baby, the split was 80/20 in his favor, which he found manageable, but now it's worse. He tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby. The author then brings in his mom without his wife's permission, which made her upset.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to consider is the author's actions. He tried to communicate his needs to his wife, but when she didn't respond as he hoped, he decided to involve his mom without her consent. That seems like a problem because he didn't respect her autonomy in the decision. Even though he was frustrated, inviting someone to stay without discussing it properly could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut then again, he was dealing with a lot of stress\u2014working long hours and handling all the housework and baby care. His mom's help did alleviate some of that pressure, which is understandable. However, the way he handled it was without his wife's input, leading to her feeling undermined. \n\nI should also think about the wife's perspective. She might feel that her efforts in caring for the baby are not being recognized, or maybe she's dealing with postpartum issues that she hasn't communicated. The author didn't seek professional help or mediation before taking this step. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe discussing the possibility of temporary help together, rather than making a unilateral decision. The author's actions might have been out of necessity, but the method could have been better. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author made a mistake in not involving his wife in the decision properly, hence being in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the stress justified it. Hmm, but the key point is that he didn't have a conversation where they could both agree. So, answer A.\n"
