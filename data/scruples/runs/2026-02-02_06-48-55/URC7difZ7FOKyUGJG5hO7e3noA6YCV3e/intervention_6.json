It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay after his wife refused. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and his wife have a history where he does most of the housework, even before the baby. Now, with the baby, his wife isn't contributing at all, except for baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and does all the chores. He's tried talking to his wife, but she's uncooperative, saying she's too tired. \n\nHe then confides in his mom, who offers to help. When he suggests it to his wife, she gets angry and refuses. He gives her a week, but nothing changes. He then invites his mom without his wife's permission. His wife is upset, and friends are commenting on how he \"undermined\" her.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author feels overwhelmed, tried to communicate with his wife, but she didn't help. He turned to his mom for support when he couldn't handle it alone. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Communication Attempts**: He did try to talk to his wife and asked for help. She didn't respond well and didn't contribute. That might support his side.\n\n2. **Inviting Mom Without Permission**: He didn't discuss it with his wife and went ahead. This could be seen as undermining her authority or making a unilateral decision. But if his wife was being non-cooperative and he was at his breaking point, maybe it's understandable.\n\n3. **Wife's Reaction**: The wife was upset and felt her autonomy was disregarded. Friends are pointing out that the author's action was disrespectful. On the flip side, maybe his wife isn't taking his needs into account either.\n\n4. **Effect on the Baby**: The mom is now being possessive of the baby, which might be a new problem. But the original issue was about workload.\n\n5. **Cultural or Family Norms**: In some contexts, having family help is normal. In others, it might be seen as overstepping.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, ideally, both parties should communicate and find a solution together. However, when one partner is not fulfilling their responsibilities and the other feels alone, taking action might be necessary. The author's action might be seen as necessary for his well-being, even if it's not ideal. But the way he did it, without prior agreement, could be seen as a breach of trust or disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's refusal to let in help might stem from her own stress or defensiveness. But she could have at least collaborated to find a solution. The author's decision might be a result of feeling neglected and needing support.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because he didn't consider his wife's feelings and acted unilaterally. If B (No), it's because his actions were necessary due to the wife's refusal to help, leading to his burnout.\n\nI think different people might have different takes. Some might side with the author, seeing his action as justified. Others might say he should have found another way first, like couples counseling or more open communication. Since the wife didn't help despite the author's pleas, the author might feel he had no choice. But the unilateral decision is a point against him.\n\nSo the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he was trying to get support for his well-being, but there's a case for A (Yes) because he didn't involve his wife in the decision. However, given the situation, B might be more plausible.\n"
