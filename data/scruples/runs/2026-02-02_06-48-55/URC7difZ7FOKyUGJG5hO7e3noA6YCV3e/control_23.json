It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby, despite the wife's initial refusal.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The husband and wife had a baby. The husband mentions that before the baby, the housework split was 65/35 in his favor, but after the baby, the wife almost stopped doing any housework except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted, but still does all the chores. He's tried asking for help, but the wife says she's too tired and won't contribute. The husband then vents to his mom, who offers to help. When he proposes it to his wife, she gets angry and says they can handle it. He proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week with no change, leading to tension between them and the mother-in-law being cold.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband is clearly overwhelmed, and the wife isn't helping, which is causing him stress. He communicated his needs, tried to resolve it with his wife, but when she didn't respond, he took action. On the other hand, inviting a parent into the household without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining the wife. However, the husband might feel he has a right to seek help, especially since the wife isn't providing it. \n\nIn some cultural contexts, involving family might be expected. But in others, it's considered a breach of trust. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband tried to discuss it with his wife, but she refused. He then gave her a week to change, which she didn't, so he acted. The problem is that he went behind her back, which might have been hurtful. However, he was trying to manage the household and his own well-being. \n\nThe wife's reaction is valid\u2014she felt undermined. But the husband's actions were driven by his need to manage the household. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did communicate his intentions but proceeded without her agreement, it's a judgment call. Some might say he had a right to seek help, others might say he should have handled it differently. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads, often the key is whether the person acted respectfully. Here, the husband did try to talk to his wife, gave her a chance, then acted when she didn't help. He might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuance. However, the answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some cases, involving parents without consent could be seen as wrong. But given the circumstances, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
