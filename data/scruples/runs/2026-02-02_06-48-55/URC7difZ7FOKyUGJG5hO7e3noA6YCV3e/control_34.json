It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a new dad who's overwhelmed with housework and his wife isn't helping much. He asked his mom to come stay and help, but his wife was upset. The question is whether the author did the right thing by inviting his mom without his wife's approval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband feels he's doing the majority of the housework, which is straining him. His wife is also exhausted from taking care of the baby, so she's not contributing. He tried talking to her, but she wasn't helping. Then he brought in his mom, which helped him but upset his wife.\n\nThe key points are: Did the husband handle the situation appropriately? Was inviting his mom without his wife's permission the right move? Communication is a big factor here. The husband did express his feelings and tried to talk to his wife, but she wasn't responsive. When he mentioned inviting his mom, she was angry. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, involving a third party, especially a parent, without consulting the spouse can be seen as undermining the spouse. However, the husband was at his breaking point and needed help. The mom's help actually improved the situation for him and allowed them to have some time together, which might be beneficial in the long run.\n\nBut there's a conflict here. The wife might feel disrespected or not part of the decision. However, the husband had tried to communicate and felt he had no other options. It's a balance between self-care and respecting the spouse's autonomy. \n\nIn some cases, bringing in family help is a common solution for new parents, especially when one parent is overburdened. The problem is the manner in which it was done without the wife's consent. However, if the husband tried to communicate and the wife was unresponsive, maybe he had valid reasons to act. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some cultures, involving family help is normal, and the wife's reaction might be seen as overly sensitive. In others, the husband's action could be seen as stepping over a line by not discussing it further with his wife. \n\nBut given that the husband had already tried to talk and the wife wasn't cooperating, maybe he had no choice. The fact that his mom's help allowed them to have a break and improved their situation (as they went out to lunch) might be a positive outcome. So, while the approach might not have been perfect, the intention was to alleviate stress and the result was helpful.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But there's a nuance where communication could have been better. However, since he had tried to talk and the wife was not helping, maybe he was justified.\n"
