It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with them after having a baby. The situation is that the author and their wife are dealing with a lot of housework after the birth of their child. The wife isn't contributing much, and the author is struggling with all the chores and work. The author's mom offers to help and stay for a couple of weeks, but the wife is upset when the author invites her. The author proceeds anyway, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the wife and he had a housework imbalance even before the baby, but it's worse now. The wife says she's too tired from the baby to help. The author feels overwhelmed and tries to get help, but when he asks his mom, he ends up inviting her without the wife's consent. The wife is upset, and their friend comments on the situation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's doing what he thinks is necessary to manage the situation. He tried talking to his wife, but it didn't work. He felt he had no other choice but to bring his mom in. However, bringing in a parent without the spouse's agreement might be seen as undermining their authority or causing additional stress in the marriage. The wife's reaction is understandable if she feels disrespected or that her partner isn't supporting her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with burnout and the mom's help is providing necessary relief. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress or a desire to maintain independence, but the author's actions might have been a last resort. The key issue is communication. The author didn't resolve the issue through dialogue with his wife, leading to a conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. While the author's intentions were good, not discussing the decision thoroughly with his wife before acting could be seen as a mistake. The wife's feelings are valid, and the author's decision might have caused more division. However, the author was also in a tough spot and seeking help. It's a situation where both parties have valid points, but the author's approach might have been hasty without fully addressing the underlying issues in his marriage first.\n"
