It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for inviting their mom to stay without their wife's permission. \n\nFirst, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the wife isn't helping with household chores, which the author is handling along with work. He tried talking to her, but she didn't change. Then his mom offered to help, and he brought her in despite the wife's initial refusal.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author did try to discuss the issue with his wife but when she refused help, he decided to act unilaterally. Inviting his mom without his wife's consent might have been a breach of trust. The wife was upset, which shows that the author's action affected their relationship. Even though the author was stressed, the way he handled it could be seen as dismissive of his wife's feelings. \n\nHowever, the wife wasn't contributing, leading to the author's exhaustion. The mom's help improved the situation for the author. But the method\u2014inviting the mom without consent\u2014could be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and collaboration. The author might have needed to find another solution or address the issue more directly with his wife instead of bringing in a parent.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's action, while understandable given the circumstances, might be in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and bypassed her decision-making process. The correct answer would be A.\n"
