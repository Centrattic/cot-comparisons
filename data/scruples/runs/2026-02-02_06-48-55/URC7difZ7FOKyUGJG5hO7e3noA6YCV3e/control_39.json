It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by inviting their mom to stay with them without their wife's permission. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the husband is doing almost all the housework. The wife is exhausted from taking care of the baby and isn't contributing to household chores. The husband tried to talk to her but she refused to help. He then told his mom about the situation, who offered to help. When he brought it up, the wife was angry and refused, so he went ahead and invited his mom anyway.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and respect in the marriage. The husband felt overwhelmed and needed help, which is understandable. But he went around his wife and invited his mom without her consent. That could be seen as undermining his wife's autonomy and their partnership. Even if the wife wasn't helping with chores, the husband should have tried to resolve this through better communication or compromise. Inviting his mom without her permission might have caused more tension and hurt feelings, especially since the wife was already stressed. \n\nBut on the other hand, the husband was at his breaking point, and the mom's help provided necessary relief. The wife might be dealing with postpartum challenges or other stressors that aren't visible. The husband's action, while well-intentioned, might not have considered the wife's feelings of being controlled or disrespected. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the husband's actions crossed a line in their relationship. Since he didn't consult his wife properly and acted unilaterally, it's possible he did. However, it's also a matter of differing perspectives. \n\nIn the end, the husband's decision to prioritize his own well-being is valid, but the method might have been flawed. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt disrespected. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, the standard answer to such situations often leans on the husband needing to communicate better and not act without his partner's input.\n"
