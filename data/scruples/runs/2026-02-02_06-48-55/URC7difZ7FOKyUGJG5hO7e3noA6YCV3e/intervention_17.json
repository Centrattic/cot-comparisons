It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The author mentions that he and his wife have always had a housework split that's not equal, with him doing 65-80% of the work. After the baby was born, his wife stopped doing housework almost entirely, only handling baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours and comes home to do all the chores, while his wife says she's too tired. He tried to get her help but she didn't. Then his mom offered to come stay and help, but the wife was angry when he told her. The author then went ahead and invited his mom without the wife's permission, leading to tension.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author did mention the housework issue to his wife and pleaded for help. She didn't respond positively. He then sought help from his mom, which seems like a reasonable step given the situation. But he did it without his wife's consent after she refused. That might be the problem. The wife felt undermined and upset. The author's action could be seen as disrespectful if he didn't fully address the issue with her first. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed and the situation isn't improving. The mom's help is providing relief. The wife's friend's comment suggests that the author's action was perceived as underhanded. However, the author might feel justified because the wife wasn't helping, leading to his burnout. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. The author tried to talk to his wife but didn't resolve the issue. Inviting his mom without her consent might have been a poor decision. Maybe he should have sought couples counseling or found another way to address the imbalance before bringing in his mom. The wife's anger and feeling of being undermined are valid reactions. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not resolving the issue within the marriage first. However, his intentions were to alleviate his burden. It's a tough situation. But since the wife felt disrespected by the unilateral decision, it's possible the author made a mistake in how he handled it, even if his motives were good.\n"
