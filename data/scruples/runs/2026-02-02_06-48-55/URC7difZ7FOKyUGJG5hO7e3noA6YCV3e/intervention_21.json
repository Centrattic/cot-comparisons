It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by bringing their mom in to stay with their wife after having a baby. The setup is that the wife isn't doing her share of the housework, and the husband is overwhelmed. He told his mom about the problem, and she offered to help, but when he told his wife, she was upset and didn't want help. The husband then went ahead and invited the mom anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband feels like he's doing most of the housework, which is causing him stress. The wife claims she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The husband's mom steps in to help, but the wife doesn't want her there. The key points are communication and consent in the marriage.\n\nThe husband did try talking to his wife and asking for help, but she wasn't responding. He then confided in his mom, which might have been a problem if he didn't communicate effectively with his wife. By inviting the mom without the wife's permission, he might have undermined her autonomy. Even if the wife was being difficult, bringing in a parent without mutual agreement could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly overburdened and in a vulnerable situation. The mom's help is providing much-needed relief. But the issue is whether the husband had the right to bypass his wife's wishes. In a marriage, both partners should ideally agree to external help, especially from family. The husband's approach might have been too abrupt and could have been handled better by seeking couples therapy or mediation first.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were to alleviate his stress, the way he handled it by unilaterally inviting his mom might be considered wrong because it didn't respect his wife's feelings and the marital agreement. The wife's feelings of being undermined are valid, even if the husband felt desperate.\n"
