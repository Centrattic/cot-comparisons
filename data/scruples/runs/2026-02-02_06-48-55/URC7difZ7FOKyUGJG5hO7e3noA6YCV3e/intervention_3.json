It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting his mom come stay with them after having a child. The situation is that the author and his wife have a baby, and the wife isn't contributing to housework. The author is doing most of it, even after work. He confides in his mom, who then offers to help. The wife objects, but he goes ahead anyway. The mom ends up helping, and the wife is upset. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main complaint is the unequal division of labor. His wife is doing minimal housework, which is causing him stress. He's tried to communicate, but she resists. The mom offers help, which the author accepts after the wife refuses. The wife then feels undermined and angry.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author reached out to his mom for support after his wife wasn't helping. That's understandable, given the stress of new parenthood. However, the way he went over his wife's head to invite his mom might be problematic. Even if the wife was resistant, involving family without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy in the relationship. \n\nBut then again, the author is exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. The mom's help does alleviate some of the pressure. The wife's friend comments on undermining her, which suggests that the wife's feelings are valid. However, the author might have felt that his own well-being and the family's stability were at stake. \n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's actions crossed a line. In relationships, communication is key. The author tried to talk to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. Maybe he should have tried more collaborative problem-solving before involving his mom. But given the stress of new parenthood, it's also understandable that he sought help. \n\nOn the other hand, involving a parent without a spouse's consent can create tension. The wife might feel that her partner is taking sides with his mother, which can strain the marriage. The author's decision to go ahead despite his wife's objections might have been a mistake in terms of relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, considering the author's perspective, he's dealing with a heavy workload and lack of support. The mom's help is a practical solution. But the method of introduction might not have been the best. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the action of bringing in the mom without agreement was respectful. If the author didn't communicate effectively or seek mutual agreement, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the situation was dire and he felt it necessary for his well-being, some might argue it's not wrong. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to consider whether the author acted in a way that's acceptable. The key issue is respect for the spouse's autonomy. The author went against his wife's wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the alternative of enduring all the stress without help isn't ideal either. It's a tough spot, but perhaps the author should have tried more to mediate the situation with his wife before involving his mom. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes by bringing in his mom without her consent, which could have worsened the relationship dynamics. Even if the situation was difficult, the approach taken might have been disrespectful to his spouse.\n"
