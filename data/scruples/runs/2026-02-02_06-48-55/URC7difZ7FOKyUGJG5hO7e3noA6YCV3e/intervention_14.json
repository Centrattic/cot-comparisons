It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author invited his mother to stay with them after his wife wasn't doing any housework post-baby, even after he tried to talk to her about it. The wife was upset, and the mother-in-law is being cold and possessive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife have a newborn, and he's doing all the housework. He's tried to communicate with his wife, but she's not helping. He vented to his mom, who offered to help. When he told his wife, she got angry and refused. He then went ahead and invited the mom without the wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the decision to bring in the mother without the wife's agreement. Even though the author was struggling, the wife felt it was unnecessary. The author's actions, while understandable due to exhaustion, might have been a breach of trust or autonomy. The wife's feelings are valid because she might feel disrespected. However, the author's perspective is that he was overwhelmed and the wife wasn't helping. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, it's reasonable for the author to seek help when he's overburdened. On the other hand, involving a parent in the marital conflict without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining her. The wife's anger might stem from feeling that her partner didn't trust her to handle the situation or didn't communicate properly. \n\nThe author did try to talk to his wife, but maybe not effectively. He might have escalated the issue without exhausting all communication avenues. The fact that the mother-in-law is now being cold and possessive adds another layer of tension. The author might have hoped for help but didn't anticipate the emotional fallout with both his wife and mother-in-law.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did express his needs to his wife, but she didn't respond as he hoped. Inviting his mom was a way to address his own stress, but it's a sensitive area because involving family in marital issues can backfire. The wife's friend's comment suggests that the act might be seen as underhanded or disrespectful. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was justified in inviting his mom despite the wife's refusal. If the wife wasn't willing to seek help and the author felt it was necessary for his well-being, it's a tough spot. However, the method of inviting the mom without consent might be where he's in the wrong. The key is the lack of mutual agreement. \n\nIn some cultures, involving family support is common, but in others, it's seen as overstepping. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the unilateral decision. The wife's perspective is important here. Even if she's not helping, the author's approach might have been disrespectful to her autonomy. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the right if the wife was entirely unresponsive and the situation was unsustainable. But the line between seeking help and undermining the spouse is thin. The author's actions could strain the marriage further by introducing family into the equation without the spouse's consent. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's mistake might be in not finding another solution first or not addressing the issue with more collaborative communication. By inviting his mom without the wife's approval, he might have acted out of frustration rather than partnership, which is where he's in the wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
