It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with them and their wife after having a baby. The situation is that the husband feels he's doing all the housework, and after trying to get his wife to help, he brings in his mom to help without his wife's consent. The wife is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is overwhelmed with work and housework, and the wife isn't contributing. He tried to talk to her, but she didn't help. Then he involved his mom without her consent. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her boundaries are being crossed by having in-laws suddenly move in. She might also be under a lot of stress from caring for the baby and not have the capacity to do housework, but maybe she expects the husband to handle it.\n\nIn many relationships, communication is key. The husband did talk to his wife about the workload, but she didn't help. But when he went ahead without discussing it more, that might be where the issue is. Bringing in a parent without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining the spouse, especially if there's a conflict. However, the husband was in a tough spot and felt he had no other option. \n\nCultural factors might play a role here. In some cultures, it's common for parents to help with childcare and housework. But the wife might not be used to that or might feel her autonomy is being invaded. The husband's mom was helpful, but the wife's reaction suggests that the approach taken was problematic.\n\nThe wife's friend's comment about undermining her implies that the action could have been unwise. The husband could have tried other solutions first, like couples counseling or hiring help, instead of bringing in his mom without her agreement. Even though the husband's mom was trying to help, the method of involving her without consulting the wife might have been disrespectful.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were to alleviate his stress and improve their situation, the way he did it by unilaterally inviting his mom could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate better and acted without considering his wife's feelings and boundaries.\n"
