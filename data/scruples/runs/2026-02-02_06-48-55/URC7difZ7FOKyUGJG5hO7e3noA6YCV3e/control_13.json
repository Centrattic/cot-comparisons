It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after the birth of their child. \n\nFirst, the key points: The couple had a baby, and the wife isn't contributing to household chores beyond baby-related tasks. The husband is working 45 hours and doing all the housework. He tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping and says she's too tired. He confides in his mom, who offers to help. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and refuses. He proceeds to invite his mom anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The husband feels he's overworked and under-supported. He sought help from his mom, which is a common solution when one parent can't manage. But the wife felt disrespected and undermined. The husband didn't communicate effectively with his wife before bringing in his mom, which might have been a mistake. However, he was clearly burnt out and needed support. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, involving family without mutual agreement could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the situation\u2014exhaustion, lack of help\u2014it's also understandable. The wife's resentment is valid, but the husband's actions were driven by necessity. The mom's help improved their situation, but the method of bringing her in was problematic. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he was desperate for help, but he should have handled the situation better by discussing it more with his wife before making decisions. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he did act without her consent, maybe there's some fault there. But given the circumstances, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the better answer here.\n"
