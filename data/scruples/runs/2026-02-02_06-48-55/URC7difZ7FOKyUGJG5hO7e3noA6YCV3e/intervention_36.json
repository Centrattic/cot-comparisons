It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting their mom stay after their wife refused. The situation is about housework distribution and the author feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife does almost no housework post-baby, despite his attempts to ask for help. He's working 45 hours, which he says isn't too bad, but after coming home, he's handling all the chores. The wife justifies it by saying she's too tired from the baby. The author then brings in his mom without the wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author tried to communicate with the wife about the workload but wasn't getting anywhere. He felt burnt out and decided to bring in his mom, which the wife was against. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, bringing in a parent without the partner's consent could be seen as undermining the wife. It might make her feel disrespected or not trusted to handle the situation. The wife might feel like her needs or preferences are being ignored. Communication is key in relationships, and not discussing it thoroughly before taking action could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly exhausted and overwhelmed. The wife isn't contributing to the household, and the author has tried to address it without success. The mom's help provides necessary relief, especially for the baby's care. The author's decision might be a last resort to manage their situation.\n\nBut the main issue here is the lack of communication and mutual agreement. Even if the author felt desperate, involving a third party without the partner's consent can lead to resentment. The right approach might have been to seek couples counseling or find another way to address the workload together. By going behind his wife's back, the author could be perceived as not respecting her autonomy in the relationship.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to alleviate his stress and take care of the baby, the method he used might be in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and didn't find a collaborative solution. The answer would likely be A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like the wife being unreasonable. However, the author's actions still crossed a line by not involving the wife in the decision-making process.\n"
