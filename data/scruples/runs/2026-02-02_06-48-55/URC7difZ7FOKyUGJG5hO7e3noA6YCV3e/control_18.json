It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the wife isn't doing any housework. The author is doing all the work, which is leading to exhaustion. He reaches out to his mom, who offers to help, but the wife refuses. The author then brings his mom in anyway after a week, which upsets the wife further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the wife and he had a housework split that was already skewed in his favor before the baby. Now, since the baby, she's doing even less. He's working 45 hours, comes home exhausted, and does all the chores. He's tried talking to her, but she responds by saying she's too tired. The author's mom steps in and offers help, which he accepts, but the wife is upset because she didn't want that help.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author was right to bring in his mom without the wife's consent. On one hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed and has tried communicating his needs. He's exhausted and the situation isn't improving. Maybe he felt he had no other choice. On the other hand, bringing in a parent without discussing it thoroughly with his wife could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting her wishes. The wife might feel that her autonomy over the household decisions is being overridden.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable\u2014she might feel disrespected or that her partner didn't trust her to handle the situation. However, the author could argue that he's trying to take action to save their marriage from stress and burnout. The wife's refusal to help with housework is causing significant strain, and the mom's help is providing necessary relief. \n\nBut then again, there's the question of communication. Did the author try all possible ways to resolve the issue with his wife before involving his mom? He mentioned pleading and expressing his exhaustion, but maybe there's a lack of effective communication. Perhaps he should have sought couples counseling or other forms of mediation before bringing in family. However, given the context, the author's actions might be seen as a last resort to prevent further marital issues.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife. Even though the mom's help is beneficial, the way it was introduced without the wife's consent could have caused more harm in their relationship. The wife's friend pointing out the issue suggests that societal expectations might lean towards seeing the author's action as undermining his wife, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo weighing these factors: the author's intent was to alleviate his stress and help the family, but the method might have been poor communication. Being in the wrong might depend on whether the action was necessary and how it was handled. If there was a breach of trust or communication, then maybe he is in the wrong. But if the situation was dire and he had no other options, it could be justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but the fact that he went ahead without final agreement might tip it towards him being in the wrong.\n"
