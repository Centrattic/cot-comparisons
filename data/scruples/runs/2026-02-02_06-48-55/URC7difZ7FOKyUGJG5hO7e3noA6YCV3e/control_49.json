It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having their mom come stay with them after the birth of their child because the wife isn't doing her share of the housework. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the wife isn't contributing to housework, even after having the baby. They tried talking to her, but she's too exhausted or unwilling. The author is working 45 hours a week and doing all the chores, which is leading to burnout. \n\nThe mom steps in to help, but when the author invites her, the wife gets angry. The author then proceeds to let the mom come anyway after a week of no change. The wife is upset, and the friend comments on it, making the author feel undermined.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author did mention the issue to the wife and tried to address it, but the wife wasn't willing to help. The author felt overwhelmed and needed support. Bringing in the mom was a way to get that help. However, the author didn't consult the wife properly before making the decision. Even though the wife was resistant, the author could have tried other methods first, like couples counseling or setting clear boundaries. By inviting the mom without the wife's consent, it might come off as a betrayal, especially if the wife felt that the author wasn't standing by her. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is under a lot of stress and the wife isn't contributing. The mom's help is practical. The question is whether the author acted in the wrong by not respecting the wife's wishes versus the necessity of the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should share the workload after a child. The wife's not doing her part is part of the problem. The author's actions might be seen as necessary for their well-being, but the approach was flawed by not involving the wife more in the decision-making. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author went ahead without the wife's agreement despite the wife's clear objections, that could be seen as wrong. Hence, maybe answer A. But I need to consider cultural factors too. In some cultures, involving parents is common, but the wife's feelings matter. So maybe the answer is A because the author didn't handle the communication well, leading to conflict. Alternatively, B if the author's actions were justified due to stress and lack of help.\n"
