It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their wife had a baby four months ago. The wife was already doing less housework before, and now she's doing almost none, except baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week and is exhausted. When he comes home, he does all the housework because the wife won't help, even after he asks. He mentions he tried to communicate, but the wife is also exhausted from taking care of the baby. \n\nThen, the author's mom steps in. The author talks to his mom, who offers to help. The author is grateful and arranges it with his wife, but when he tells her, she gets angry. He then threatens to invite his mom without her permission if things don't change. When the mom arrives, the wife gets upset, and there's some conflict. The friend comments that the author undermined his wife, but he says it's between them.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication, shared responsibilities, boundaries, and the wife's reaction. The author felt overwhelmed and sought help from his mom when his wife wasn't contributing. But he didn't handle it well by going behind his wife's back. Inviting someone into the home without the spouse's consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's anger is valid because she felt disrespected. However, the author's burnout is understandable. The question is whether his actions crossed a line.\n\nIn relationships, collaboration is important. The author should have tried to resolve the issue with his wife first, maybe through couples counseling or clearer communication. Inviting the mom without agreement might have been a mistake. But the wife's refusal to help is also a problem. The author's intention was to seek support, which is reasonable, but the method may have been flawed. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The answer could be A (Yes) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes, but also B (No) because he was trying to address his needs. However, in relationship advice scenarios, undermining your partner's autonomy can be seen as wrong. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
