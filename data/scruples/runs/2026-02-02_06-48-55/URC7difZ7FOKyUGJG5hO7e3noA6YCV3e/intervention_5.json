It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife refused. The situation involves the author doing most of the housework while their wife isn't contributing much. The wife is handling the baby during the day, which is tiring, but the author feels they are doing 80% of the chores. They tried talking to the wife, but she's not helping. The author then contacts their mom, who offers to help, and when the wife refuses, the author goes ahead and invites the mom anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels overwhelmed and is trying to get help. The wife isn't contributing to household tasks, which is causing stress. The author's mom steps in, but the wife is upset when the author brings her in without consent. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by not discussing this more with the wife or if they were justified in seeking help.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate with the wife, who didn't respond positively. Maybe the author felt they had exhausted options and needed support. On the other hand, bringing in a parent without the spouse's agreement might infringe on the couple's autonomy. However, the wife's lack of contribution could be a significant factor. The author might feel that their needs are being neglected, leading to burnout. \n\nBut the act of inviting the mom without the wife's approval could be seen as undermining the wife's authority in the household. Even if the author is struggling, the decision to bring in family without mutual agreement might have caused additional tension. The wife's friend's comment suggests that others see it as a betrayal or lack of consideration. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to alleviate their own stress and improve the family's situation. The mom's help did provide some relief. It's a tough spot because both parties have valid feelings. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like seeking couples counseling before bringing in their mom. Still, given the circumstances of exhaustion and lack of help, the author's actions might be seen as a last resort rather than a malicious act.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might not be a clear A or B. But since the options are A for yes and B for no, I need to decide. If the author's actions, while perhaps impulsive, were driven by necessity and the wife's refusal to cooperate, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the method of handling it (inviting without consent) might be the issue. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might say the author should have handled it differently, but others might empathize with their need for help. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the situation is complex, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to solve the problem, even if the approach was flawed.\n"
