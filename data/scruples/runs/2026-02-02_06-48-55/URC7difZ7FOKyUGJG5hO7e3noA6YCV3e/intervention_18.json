It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife wasn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the wife used to do 35% of the housework before the baby, which dropped to almost nothing after the baby. The author is doing all the work, coming home from a 45-hour job to handle everything. The wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author tried to communicate, but the wife didn't help. \n\nThen the author's mom offers to help, but when the author brings it up, the wife gets angry and says they can handle it. The author then threatens to bring the mom in anyway if things don't change, which they do. The mom's arrival causes tension, and the wife is upset, even though the mom is helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and consent. The author tried to talk to the wife, but when that didn't work, they made a unilateral decision. The wife's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or undermined. Inviting a parent into the household without the spouse's consent might be seen as overstepping, even if the author felt justified. Partners should ideally make such decisions together, especially involving family. The author's intention was to alleviate stress, but the method might have been flawed. They didn't resolve the issue through continued dialogue or seeking couples counseling first. Bringing in a parent can add more stress if not agreed upon mutually. So, while the author's struggle is valid, the approach might be where they went wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
