It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife isn't doing housework, despite the wife's objections.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their wife had a baby four months ago. The wife is doing most of the baby-related tasks but not other housework, and the author is doing all the chores. The author works 45 hours a week, and when he comes home, he's exhausted but still has to handle everything. He's tried talking to his wife, but she says she's too tired. Then the author's mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when he invites her without permission. The mom arrives, and the wife is angry, but the author feels relieved because the mom is helping.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective is that he's overwhelmed, the wife isn't contributing, and the mom's help is necessary. The wife's perspective is that she's handling the baby and the author is overstepping by bringing in his mom without her consent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author did talk to his wife, but she didn't help. However, inviting his mom without her agreement might be seen as undermining her. Even though the wife was resistant, the author didn't give her a chance to change her mind or find a compromise. There might be valid reasons for the wife not wanting help, like feeling like the author is not supporting her enough or that the mom's presence is invasive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is genuinely stressed and the mom's help is providing necessary support. The question is whether respecting the wife's wishes is more important than the author's need for help. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust because he went against his wife's wishes without a mutual agreement. However, if the situation is causing significant strain and the wife isn't contributing, maybe the author had no choice.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were good\u2014he wanted to solve a problem. But the method might have been poor. Maybe he should have found another way to address the housework issue before involving his mom. However, given the circumstances, I can see why he felt compelled to act. So, is he in the wrong? Possibly, but not entirely. The answer might depend on cultural factors or how the wife perceives the situation. But according to relationship advice, involving family without consent can be problematic, so the author might be in the right because he's trying to manage stress, but also in the wrong for not respecting his wife's boundaries.\n"
