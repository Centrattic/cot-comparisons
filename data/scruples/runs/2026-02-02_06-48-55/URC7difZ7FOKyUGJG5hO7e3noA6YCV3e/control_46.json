It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for letting his mom come stay with them after having a child. The situation involves the author and his wife dealing with housework and childcare, with the author doing almost all the work. He tried to get his wife's help, but she's too tired or unwilling. He then brings in his mom without his wife's permission after threatening to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels overwhelmed, working 45 hours a week and handling all the housework. His wife isn't contributing, which is causing stress. He reaches out to his mom, who offers help. When he brings it up to his wife, she's upset and resists. He then proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change. The wife is angry and feels undermined, and a friend comments on that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, the author is trying to manage his responsibilities and has valid reasons for needing help. However, by going around his wife and inviting his mom without her consent, he might have acted without considering her feelings, leading to conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to seek support when he's overburdened, especially if communication with his wife isn't working. On the other hand, involving a parent in a marital issue without the spouse's consent could be seen as undermining the wife's authority and potentially causing further tension. \n\nBut in this case, the wife wasn't helping, and the author had tried to communicate. The mom's help was a last resort after the wife refused to assist. It's a common issue in marriages where one partner feels overworked. The author's actions might be seen as necessary for his well-being and the baby's care, even if the method was a bit abrupt. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to bring his mom in if she didn't change her ways and then doing it without her consent\u2014could be viewed as dismissive of her feelings. But given the circumstances, the author's priority was to address his own burnout and ensure the baby was properly cared for. The wife's lack of cooperation left him with limited options. \n\nIn some cultures, family support is common, but in others, it might be seen as stepping over boundaries. The key points are communication and the necessity of the action. The author did try to talk to his wife and didn't get help, so his decision to involve his mom might be justified. The problem lies in the approach, but the intention was to solve a real issue. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the action of bringing in the mom without permission is considered wrong. If the situation was dire and communication failed, it's understandable. But if the wife's feelings were completely disregarded, maybe. But given the details, the author's actions seem reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
