It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author inviting his mother to stay with his wife and him after his wife isn't helping with housework postpartum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that his wife isn't contributing to household chores, which he finds unfair. He's been doing most of the work even before the baby. After the baby, she's stopped doing almost all housework. He's tried to communicate his exhaustion and asked for help, but she's not cooperating. He then involves his mom, who offers to help, but when he tells his wife, she's upset and doesn't want the mom there. The author then brings his mom anyway after a week without change.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by inviting his mom without his wife's consent. On one hand, he's clearly struggling and feels overwhelmed. He's communicated his needs but feels ignored. Inviting a family member might seem like a solution when communication isn't working. However, doing it without the wife's agreement could be seen as undermining her autonomy, especially in the context of their marriage.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's perspective. She might feel that the author's decision to bring in his mom is a breach of trust or a dismissal of her efforts. Even if she's not doing the housework, she might have her own reasons\u2014postpartum stress, fatigue, or feeling resentful about the situation. The author's actions might have caused tension in their relationship and with the mother-in-law, who is now being cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nThe author's approach of using a \"week ultimatum\" and then proceeding without his wife's permission could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Healthy relationships require mutual agreement and respect for each other's boundaries. Even if the wife isn't contributing to chores, the solution shouldn't be to bypass her and bring in another person without her input. This could lead to more conflict rather than a resolution.\n\nHowever, the author's exhaustion and feeling of being overwhelmed are valid. The wife isn't meeting basic household responsibilities, which is adding to his stress. The question is whether the method he chose to address the problem was appropriate. By not involving his wife in the decision-making process, he might have caused more harm than good, even if his intentions were good.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author had a legitimate problem and tried to solve it, but the method involved not respecting his wife's wishes, which is a red flag. The wife's reaction indicates that she values their partnership and autonomy over their home. The author's decision to go ahead without her consent, despite knowing she was upset, shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and their relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's autonomy and for making a unilateral decision that affected both their lives and their relationship. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
