It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework post-baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple had a baby, and the husband is doing all the housework. He's working 45 hours a week, and even though he's tired, he's doing all the chores. The wife isn't helping, saying she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby. The husband tried talking to her, but she's not willing to pitch in. Then the husband's mom offers to come stay and help. The husband is grateful and arranges it, but the wife gets angry and refuses. He then invites his mom anyway after a week, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's overwhelmed with work and housework. He's trying to manage everything, and his wife isn't contributing. He feels like he's doing 80% of the work, which is unsustainable. He sought help from his mom, which he felt was necessary for his well-being and the family's.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She's taking care of the baby all day, which is tiring. She might feel like she's doing the main job (caring for the baby) and doesn't see the household chores as her priority. She might also feel that inviting her mother-in-law is disrespectful or could cause family tension. She might not want to rely on someone else when she believes they should handle it themselves.\n\nThe mom's role: She's coming to help, but her presence is causing conflict. The wife is upset, and the mom is being possessive of the baby. The husband's action of inviting the mom without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining the wife's wishes and possibly creating more stress.\n\nLegally and socially, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's a co-parent, so he has a right to seek help if he feels overwhelmed. However, without discussing it more with his wife and getting her consent, he might have acted unilaterally. The wife might feel disrespected if he made that decision without considering her feelings. On the other hand, the husband's health and well-being are important, and he was trying to find a solution to a problem he's been facing for a while.\n\nIt's a balance between respecting his wife's wishes and his need for support. The key issue here is communication. Did he try to resolve the issue with his wife first before taking drastic action? He did talk to her, but she wasn't willing to help. Maybe he could have explored other solutions first, like counseling or adjusting roles. But given that he tried pleading and she didn't respond, he might have felt it's the only option left.\n\nThe mother-in-law's involvement could complicate things further, especially if the wife already has a good relationship but now feels her space is invaded. The husband's decision might have been necessary for his own sanity but handled poorly in terms of communication with his wife.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's acting in his own interest and the family's. On the other, he didn't respect his wife's initial refusal and caused conflict. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family dynamics, but in many cases, major decisions involving family help should be mutual. Since he went ahead without her permission, he could be seen as wrong. But if the alternative is him being burnt out, maybe it's understandable.\n"
