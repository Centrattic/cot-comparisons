It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the husband and wife had a baby, and the wife isn't contributing to housework as she used to. The husband tries to communicate his exhaustion but the wife isn't helping. He then brings in his mom without the wife's consent, which leads to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is working 45 hours a week, which is standard but can be tiring. He's doing most of the housework, which was an 80/20 split before. After the baby, the wife's contribution dropped even more. He's tried to discuss this with her, but she responds with being too tired. He feels overwhelmed and decides to bring in his mom for help because he can't handle it all. However, the wife is upset about this and feels her autonomy was ignored.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual agreement. The husband tried to talk to his wife and express his needs but didn't get the support he wanted. Instead of finding another solution together, he decided to bring in his mom unilaterally. While it's understandable he's stressed, not involving the wife in the decision might come off as disrespectful. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her wishes were disregarded, which could harm their relationship. \n\nHowever, there's also a valid argument that the husband felt he had no choice after repeated attempts to resolve the issue. The mother's help is providing necessary support. But the method of bringing her in without consent is questionable. Healthy relationships require collaboration, and bypassing the wife's input might have been a misstep. \n\nSo, the husband's action, while stemming from a place of need, might be seen as inconsiderate of his wife's feelings and their partnership. He could have tried other avenues or sought couples counseling before making a unilateral decision. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's autonomy despite her objections, even if his intentions were good.\n"
