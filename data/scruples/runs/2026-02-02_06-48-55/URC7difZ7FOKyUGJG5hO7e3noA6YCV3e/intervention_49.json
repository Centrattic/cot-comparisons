It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby because the wife isn't helping with housework, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that since having the baby, the wife has almost stopped doing housework except for baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours, is exhausted, and the wife is also exhausted but doesn't help with chores. The author tried asking for help but the wife refused, citing being too tired. The author then confided in their mom, who offered to help, and the author invited her over without the wife's consent when she refused the help. The mom's arrival made the wife angry, and the author now feels the mom's help is necessary.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author tried to communicate with the wife and get help but wasn't successful. They reached out to family for support when they were overwhelmed, which might be understandable. On the other hand, involving their mom without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining the wife and not addressing the issue through proper communication. The wife's reaction suggests she felt disrespected, and the author's decision to bring in the mom without her agreement could be seen as overstepping, especially if the couple hadn't resolved their conflict before involving family.\n\nBut maybe the author felt they had no choice after repeated failures to get help. However, the method of bringing in the mom without consent might be problematic. It's important to consider whether there were other ways to handle it, like couples counseling or more direct communication. The fact that the author told the wife they would invite the mom with or without her permission might have been a red flag. The wife's anger and the friend's comment indicate that the action might have been seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties have valid points. The author is overwhelmed and needs help, but the wife also has the right to make decisions about her household. The key issue here is the lack of mutual problem-solving. The author didn't address the root of the wife's exhaustion or lack of motivation to help with housework. Maybe there are underlying issues that weren't discussed, like postpartum depression or differing views on household responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have handled the situation differently, perhaps by seeking couples' mediation or finding another solution before bringing in their mom. Inviting the mom without consent could be seen as a breach of trust, making the author at least partially at fault. However, if the author felt completely unsupported and tried to communicate already, their actions could be seen as a last resort. But generally, involving family without consent in a marital dispute might be considered inconsiderate. So, leaning towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't address the issue within the marriage first and brought in an external party without agreement.\n"
