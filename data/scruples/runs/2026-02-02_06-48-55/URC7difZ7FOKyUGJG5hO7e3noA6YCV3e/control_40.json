It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the couple had a baby four months ago, and the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The husband is working 45-hour weeks and ends up doing all the chores. He tried asking for help but the wife says she's too tired. The husband then brings in his mom without the wife's permission, which upset the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband feels overwhelmed and is doing almost all the housework, which is taking a toll. The wife isn't helping, and when he asks, she's dismissive. It's a common issue in new parents, where exhaustion leads to imbalance. The husband's solution is to bring in his mom, but that's a big step because it involves family and can affect the marital relationship.\n\nIs the husband wrong for bringing in his mom without the wife's consent? Well, he did communicate his problems first, but when the wife refused to accept help, he took matters into his own hands. While he might be justified in his exhaustion, bypassing the wife's wishes could be seen as undermining her. The mom's presence might make the wife feel unsupported or criticized, even if that's not the intention. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is struggling and trying to manage both work and home life, which is a lot. The wife's not contributing, and he's doing everything. The mom's help is a relief for him, allowing him to rest and even spend time with friends. But the way he did it\u2014without the wife's agreement\u2014might be problematic. The wife's reaction is understandable; she might feel her autonomy is disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The husband tried to talk to his wife but didn't get results. However, instead of finding another solution together, he went ahead with a unilateral decision. That could strain their marriage further. The wife's friend points out that he undermined her, which is a valid concern. Even if the husband's intention was to reduce his burden, the method might have been flawed. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not wrong for being overwhelmed, but the action of bringing his mom without consent could be seen as wrong because it disregards his wife's feelings and preferences. The situation requires more negotiation and perhaps mediation rather than a unilateral decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and brought in his mom without her consent, which could harm their relationship despite his good intentions.\n"
