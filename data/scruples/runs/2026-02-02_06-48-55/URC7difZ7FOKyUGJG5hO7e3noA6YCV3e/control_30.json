It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife isn't helping with housework since having a baby.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband feels like he's doing most of the housework, around 80%, even before the baby. Now, after the baby, the wife is doing almost none, just baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours and is exhausted, but still does all the chores. He's tried talking to her, but she says she's too tired. The mom offers to help across the country, but the wife gets angry when he suggests it. The husband then brings his mom in anyway after a week with no change. The wife is upset, and the mom is cold to the baby. The friend comments that the husband undermined the wife.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The husband felt overwhelmed and tried to address it by asking his wife, but she didn't help. He then tried to involve his mom as a solution. The question is, was he wrong to do that?\n\nOn one hand, the husband's actions might be seen as overstepping because he didn't discuss it thoroughly with his wife first. Instead of finding another solution together, he brought in his mom unilaterally, which could be seen as undermining her. Marriage advice often emphasizes teamwork and communication, so perhaps the husband didn't handle the situation properly by not resolving it with his wife first.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed, and the wife isn't contributing as he would like. The mom's help provided necessary relief, which is a common scenario where family support is beneficial. Sometimes, in such situations, one partner feels they can't communicate effectively, leading to unilateral decisions. The husband might have felt that trying everything else failed, so he needed to act.\n\nBut the issue is how he handled it. He told the wife he would bring the mom if things didn't change, and then did it without her consent. This could be seen as a breach of trust, as the wife felt disrespected. Even if the mom's help was beneficial, the way the husband went about it could be problematic because it didn't respect the wife's feelings and their partnership.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband had valid reasons for stress, but the approach might have been flawed. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the unilateral decision without resolving the issue through proper communication with his wife first.\n"
