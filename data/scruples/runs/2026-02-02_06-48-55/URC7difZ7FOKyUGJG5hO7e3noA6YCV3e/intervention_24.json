It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with them after his wife isn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband and wife had a baby, and the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The husband is working 45 hours a week and doing all the chores. He tried talking to his wife, but she says she's too tired. He then tells his mom, who offers to help. The husband invites his mom without his wife's permission, which makes the wife angry. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed and the wife isn't contributing. He tried to communicate and didn't get help. Maybe he felt he had no choice but to bring in his mom. On the other hand, he did this without his wife's consent, which could be seen as undermining her. The wife might feel disrespected or that her partner isn't supporting her in their parenting journey. \n\nBut wait, the wife's main issue is the housework. Taking care of the baby is exhausting, so maybe she can't do chores. The husband is doing everything else, leading to burnout. The mom's help alleviates some stress. However, the wife's reaction is understandable because bringing in a parent might be a big step without her approval. \n\nThe husband tried to arrange it with his wife but she refused. Then he went ahead anyway. That's where the problem lies. Even if the husband's intentions were good, involving his mom without her wife's consent might be seen as disrespecting her autonomy. The wife might feel like her partner isn't standing by her in their challenges, which is a crucial time for their relationship. \n\nHowever, the husband was at the breaking point. The wife's lack of cooperation in household tasks is causing him to be overwhelmed. But maybe there's a middle ground. Communication breakdown could have led to this. The husband could have sought couples counseling instead of inviting his mom. But given the circumstances, the wife's anger is valid. \n\nSo, the author did take a unilateral action that affected both their family dynamics and his wife's feelings. Even if his actions were out of necessity, not consulting his wife properly might make him in the wrong. The wife's autonomy and their partnership are important. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the husband's situation is tough too.\n"
