It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that after having a baby, the author's wife isn't contributing to housework, so he invited his mom to help without his wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife have a child, and he's taking on all the housework. The wife, when asked to help, says she's too exhausted. The author tried to communicate, but she didn't respond positively. He then decided to let his mom come over without his wife's permission, which upset her. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Housework and childcare responsibilities can be a sensitive area in relationships. The author is clearly overwhelmed, working 45 hours a week and handling everything else. His wife is taking care of the baby during the day but not helping with other chores. The author's mom offered help, which is a kind gesture, but the wife was against it. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author was right to bring in his mom without his wife's agreement. On one hand, the author is in a stressful situation, and the mom's help is a relief. On the other, the wife might feel disrespected or undermined. The wife's reaction was anger and not wanting outside help, which could indicate she has her own way of handling things or maybe feels that her partner isn't supportive enough. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. He tried to ask his wife for help, and she didn't respond. Then he tried to involve his mom as a solution. However, not discussing this thoroughly with his wife first might have been a mistake. Even though the mom's help is beneficial, the lack of communication and the wife's feelings of being overruled could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the wife's friend pointed out that the author undermined his wife, which adds another layer. The wife might have wanted to handle the situation on her own or felt that the author didn't trust her ability to cope. The author's response to the friend was defensive, saying it's between him and his wife, which might not help in resolving the underlying issue. \n\nSo, the author's intentions were to seek help and alleviate his stress, but the method of doing so without his wife's consent could be seen as disrespectful. The right approach might have been to have more open and empathetic communication with his wife, perhaps exploring other solutions together before involving their mother. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is clearly stressed and in need of support, inviting his mom without his wife's agreement might be where he went wrong. It's about respecting each other's roles and finding a compromise. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
