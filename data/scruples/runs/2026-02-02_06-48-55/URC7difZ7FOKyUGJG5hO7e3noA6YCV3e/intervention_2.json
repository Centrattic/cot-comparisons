It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with them after his wife didn't help with housework. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, the husband is doing all the housework, which was already an issue before the baby, but now it's worse. He's working 45 hours a week, so he's tired. He tries to get his wife to help, but she says she's too exhausted. Then his mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when the husband invites her without permission. The mom comes, and the wife is angry, even though the help is beneficial for the husband.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if it's A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. Communication is key in relationships. The husband tried to talk to his wife, but she wasn't helping. He tried pleading with her, but she wasn't doing anything. He mentioned bringing his mom into the conversation but didn't discuss it with his wife first. He gave her a week to change things, and when she didn't, he invited his mom. So, he made a unilateral decision, which might have been a problem. Even though the help is good, maybe he should have worked it out with his wife first. But on the other hand, he was overwhelmed and tried to reach out before bringing in the mom. However, the wife's reaction was strong, and maybe the husband's approach was too abrupt. Maybe he should have found another way to address the issue instead of bringing in his mom without consent. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say he was justified because he was burnt out, others might say he didn't handle it properly. But the fact that he didn't consult his wife and went ahead anyway could be seen as undermining her. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the wife was completely uncooperative, the husband's actions might be understandable. But I think the issue is that he didn't communicate better. So leaning towards A, but not entirely sure.\n"
