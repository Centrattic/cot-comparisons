It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new parent couple where the husband is doing all the housework, and the wife isn't helping. The husband brings in his mom without the wife's consent. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is working 45 hours a week and doing all the housework, which is a lot. The wife is the primary caregiver for the baby, which is also exhausting. She's not contributing to housework beyond baby-related tasks. The husband tried to talk to her, but she's not helping. He then asks his mom to come in without the wife's permission, which made the wife upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did the husband handle this the right way? Well, communication is a big part of relationships. The husband did try to talk to his wife, but maybe not effectively. He might have assumed his mom's help was the only solution. Bringing in his mom without discussing it with his wife might have been a mistake because it undermined her autonomy and could have caused more conflict. The wife felt betrayed, which is a valid reaction. Even though the husband was overwhelmed, the way he resolved it by going behind her back might have been wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly under a lot of stress. The wife's refusal to help is adding to his burden. The mom's help provided some relief. But the method of involving the mom without the wife's agreement is problematic. The friends' comment about undermining the wife suggests that this action strained their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. He had a legitimate need for help, but the way he went about it without considering his wife's feelings and autonomy might be the issue. The right approach might have been to seek couples counseling or find a solution together rather than bringing in family unilaterally. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and respecting the wife's wishes.\n"
