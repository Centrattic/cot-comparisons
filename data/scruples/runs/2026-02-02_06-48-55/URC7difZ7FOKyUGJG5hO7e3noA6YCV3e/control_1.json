It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife isn't contributing to housework after having a baby, so he let his mom stay to help without his wife's permission. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and his wife have a new baby, and he's been doing most of the housework\u2014initially 65/35, now 80/20. After the baby, the wife does almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He's exhausted from work and the house, and when he asks her to help, she says she's too tired. He tried to communicate, but she's not cooperating. His mom offered to help, and he invited her over without discussing it first with his wife. The wife got angry and felt undermined. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Housework and childcare are common stress points for new parents. The key issue is the lack of cooperation from the wife. The author has communicated his exhaustion, pleaded for help, but she hasn't changed her behavior. He tried to bring in his mom as a solution, but that led to conflict with his wife. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for inviting his mom without his wife's consent? Well, in a marriage, major decisions like bringing in a family member to stay should ideally be mutual. But the wife was resistant to any help, so he felt forced to act. The mom's presence has helped him, but the wife is upset. \n\nOn one hand, the author needed support and acted to alleviate his stress. On the other hand, he didn't consult his wife, which might have been a breach of trust. If the wife didn't want help, maybe she felt capable, or perhaps there's a deeper issue. The friend's comment suggests that the wife is upset because he went behind her back. \n\nBut the wife's behavior is also problematic. If she's not contributing and isn't open to solutions, that could be a bigger issue. The author tried to communicate, but she refused to help. The mom's intervention provided necessary relief. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. Without consulting his wife, he made a unilateral decision. However, the wife wasn't helping, and he was at the breaking point. The line between taking necessary action and overstepping is thin. In AITA situations, the community often looks for whether the person acted unilaterally without considering the other's feelings. But if the wife is being unreasonable and not contributing, then the author might be justified. \n\nThe wife's response of being angry and not wanting help suggests she might feel disrespected or that her capabilities are being questioned. But the author's actions were driven by his own exhaustion and need for support. The mom's help is a valid solution, especially if the couple isn't able to resolve the housework split. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he was trying to find a solution after multiple failed attempts to communicate. The wife's refusal to help led to his decision. The friend's comment might be biased, as the wife is upset. The author's intention was to support the family, even if the method was a bit abrupt. So the answer is B.\n"
