It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife wasn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband works 45 hours a week and does most of the housework, with the wife contributing very little. He tried talking to her, but she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The husband then involves his mom, who offers to help. When he tells his wife, she's angry and doesn't want the help. He goes ahead anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual respect in the marriage. The husband feels overwhelmed and seeks help, which is understandable. But did he handle it the right way? He tried to talk to his wife, but maybe not effectively. When she refused the help, he didn't get her consent. In a marriage, major decisions like having a parent stay should involve both partners. By going ahead without her agreement, he might have acted unilaterally, which could be seen as disrespectful to her wishes.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of his well-being and the household's health. If the wife isn't contributing and he's burnt out, getting help is necessary. But there's a balance between self-care and respecting your spouse's boundaries. The friend's comment about undermining his wife suggests that his action might have come off as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy.\n\nPossible angles: The husband's right to seek help vs. the importance of spousal consultation. The wife's perspective might feel that her ability to handle things is being questioned, which could hurt her pride or feel like a lack of trust. On the other hand, if the husband is genuinely overworked, not getting help could lead to resentment.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could have found another solution first, like couples counseling, or a different form of help. But the main issue is that he didn't get his wife's consent after refusing. In many relationships, major decisions require mutual agreement. His action might be seen as overstepping, even if his intentions were good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) for not respecting his wife's wishes despite the stress. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if the stress is severe and he's taking action to maintain his mental health. It's a tough call. However, the key point is the lack of communication and consent. Without that, even if the action was necessary, the method was flawed.\n"
