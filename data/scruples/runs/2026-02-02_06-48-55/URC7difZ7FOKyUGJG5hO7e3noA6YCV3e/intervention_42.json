It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife after they had a baby. The situation is that the wife isn't doing much housework, and he's handling most of it, leading to him being burnt out. He tells his mom about the problem, and she offers to help. He then goes ahead and arranges for her to come stay, even though his wife was against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife and husband have existing issues with housework, with the husband doing most of it. After the baby, the wife is doing even less. He's tried to communicate his exhaustion, but she's not responding. He reaches out to his mom, who offers to help, and he brings her in despite the wife's objections. The wife feels undermined and is upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the husband is trying to address his own burnout and the imbalance in household responsibilities. He's communicated his needs but hasn't found a resolution. Bringing in his mom might be a way to manage the situation. However, by not consulting his wife and going ahead without her consent, he might be overstepping. Respecting each other's boundaries is important in a relationship. Even if the wife isn't helping, the husband should ideally resolve the conflict together rather than unilaterally making decisions that affect both of them and the family. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that she values her autonomy and the family's dynamics. If the husband had communicated better and maybe found another solution together, like couples counseling or adjusting their responsibilities differently, it might have been better. But the immediate action of bringing in his mom without agreement could have been handled differently. However, considering his exhaustion and the lack of change despite his requests, his actions might be seen as a last resort. \n\nSo, there's a balance between self-care and respecting the partner's wishes. The author might have been in a tough spot, but the way he handled it could be seen as dismissive of his wife's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue he's justified given the circumstances. The key issue is whether he should have involved his wife more in the decision-making process instead of acting alone.\n"
