It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent couple where the husband is doing all the housework, and after trying to communicate with his wife without success, he invites his mom to stay to help, leading to conflict with his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband mentions that the main issue has always been housework, with him doing the majority even before the baby. Now, with the baby, the wife isn't helping at all. He's working 45 hours a week, and when he comes home, he's handling both work and all the chores. He tried talking to his wife, but she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby. He then confides in his mom, who offers to help. The wife objects when he brings up the mom's help, but the husband proceeds anyway after a week of no change.\n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual support in parenting, and boundaries. The husband felt overwhelmed and sought help after exhausting communication with his wife. However, he made a unilateral decision to bring in his mom without resolving the issue with his wife. While the husband's intentions were to alleviate stress, acting without his wife's consent might have caused her to feel disrespected or undermined, especially in a sensitive time like postpartum.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's need for support is valid. Parenting a newborn is challenging, and the imbalance in chores can lead to burnout. The wife's lack of willingness to contribute, despite the husband's efforts to communicate, is a problem. But the way he handled it\u2014inviting his mom without resolving the conflict\u2014could have been approached differently. Maybe setting clearer boundaries, seeking counseling together, or finding a compromise would have been better than bringing in a parent. \n\nThe wife's reaction being angry and cold might be due to feeling criticized or invaded, even if the action was for a good reason. The comment from the friend about undermining the wife is relevant here. The husband might have bypassed the wife's feelings, which can damage trust. However, the alternative of not seeking help could have led to his own burnout and further marital strain.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The husband is not entirely in the wrong because he was seeking support in a stressful situation. However, he could have handled the communication better, perhaps involving his wife more in the decision or seeking couples counseling before bringing in his mom. The act of inviting his mom without mutual agreement might have been a mistake in terms of partnership dynamics, but the root issue of unequal housework and lack of support from the wife is significant.\n\nSo, while there's a case for both sides, the main issue is the lack of collaborative problem-solving. The husband's action, though well-intentioned, might have been a misstep in respecting his wife's autonomy. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering the options given, the more balanced view is that the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he was acting out of necessity, but he could have handled it differently. Wait, the options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no. Given the nuance, maybe B is correct because the husband had valid reasons, even if the approach could have been better. But the fact that he didn't resolve the conflict before acting might tip it towards A. Hmm.\n"
