It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his wife have a baby, and the author is doing most of the housework. The wife isn't contributing much, even after he asks for help. The author's mom offers to come stay and help, but the wife is upset about it. The author goes ahead and invites the mom anyway after the wife refuses, leading to tension.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is clearly overwhelmed, doing all the work, and sought help from his mom. The wife isn't helping, which is a problem in their relationship. The author tried to communicate with his wife, but she didn't respond as he hoped. So, he took a step to get help, which his mom was willing to provide. \n\nBut is it right to invite his mom without his wife's consent? Well, the author did express his struggles and the wife didn't want help. He tried to involve her in the solution but she wasn't cooperative. The author might feel that he has a right to seek help to prevent burnout, especially since the situation affects the whole family. However, bringing in a parent without the spouse's agreement could be seen as undermining the spouse, depending on the context. The wife might feel disrespected or that her ability to handle things is being doubted.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's in a tough spot, juggling work, baby care, and all housework. His mom's help alleviates some of that, even if it causes tension. The wife's coldness towards the mom could be an issue too, maybe she's stressed or has her own reasons for not helping. However, the author's action might have been necessary for his mental health and the family's well-being.\n\nBalancing the two sides, the author tried to communicate, the wife didn't help, and he sought support. Whether he's in the wrong might depend on cultural factors or family dynamics. But generally, in a marriage, major decisions like bringing in family help might require mutual agreement. The fact that he went ahead without her consent could be problematic, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. So, the answer could be either way. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nI think the key here is that the author did try to talk to his wife and even gave her a chance to change things before bringing in his mom. When she didn't, he made a choice to prioritize his own well-being. While it's not ideal to go behind the wife's back, the situation is complex. He might not be in the wrong, but maybe there's a better approach. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on the details. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage a stressful situation and his mom's help is beneficial. The wife's anger is a reaction, but the author's action is a response to his needs after failed communication.\n"
