It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the wife isn't contributing to housework, which the author is handling along with work. He tried talking to her, but she's not helping. His mom offered to come help, but the wife was upset when he arranged it without her permission. The author ended up inviting his mom anyway after a week of no change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing most of the work, both at work and at home, which is leading to burnout. The wife is not contributing beyond baby-related tasks. The author felt like he had to bring in his mom for help. But did he handle it the right way?\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author tried talking to his wife and asking for help, but she wasn't doing anything. He then went to his mom, who offered help. When he told his wife, she was angry and felt undermined. The author then proceeded to invite his mom without her consent, which might be where the issue is. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues together. By not discussing the solution with his wife first and making a unilateral decision, the author might have breached trust. The wife might feel that her autonomy was disregarded. Even if the author was exhausted, cutting her out of the decision-making could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was clearly overwhelmed and tried to handle the situation by seeking external help. The wife's refusal to help and the author's subsequent actions were his way of managing the stress. The mom's help provided relief, which is important for the family's well-being. However, the method of involving the mom without the wife's agreement is questionable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the solution with his wife first. Even if the wife wasn't helping, the process of resolving the conflict should involve mutual agreement. The author's actions, while understandable due to exhaustion, might have caused more harm by not respecting his wife's feelings and autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a way to justify B as well. Maybe the author's well-being and the baby's care are also important, but the approach still matters. It's a balance between self-care and respecting the partner's feelings. Since the author didn't communicate the plan effectively and acted alone, it's more on the side of being in the wrong.\n"
