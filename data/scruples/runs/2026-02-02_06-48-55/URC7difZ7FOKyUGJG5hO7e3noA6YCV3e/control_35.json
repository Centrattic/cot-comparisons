It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife isn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband is doing almost all the housework, which was already a problem before the baby. After the baby, the wife is doing even less, just baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours and comes home exhausted. He's tried talking to her, but she's not helping. The mom offers to come help, he tells the wife, who gets angry. He proceeds anyway because he's overwhelmed. The mom's presence helps him, but the wife is upset, and a friend criticizes him for undermining her.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, communication is key. The husband tried talking to his wife but didn't resolve the issue. The mom stepping in could be seen as a good solution for the household's well-being. However, the husband didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process after she initially rejected the idea. Inviting someone without consent might come across as dismissive of his wife's feelings, even if he's stressed. The wife's resentment is valid because her autonomy was undermined. On the other hand, the husband's burnout is real, and the mom's help is beneficial. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the couple handles conflicts. But from a fairness perspective, the husband should have found another way to address the workload without bypassing his wife. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's decision, even if the outcome helped him.\n"
