It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to get the details right.\n\nThey have a new baby, and their wife isn't doing much housework beyond baby-related tasks. The husband is working 45 hours a week and doing most of the chores, leading to exhaustion. He tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too tired. Then he told his mom, who offered to stay and help. The wife got angry when he suggested this, and he eventually invited his mom over without her permission, leading to tension.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about household responsibilities and communication in a marriage. The husband feels overloaded, and the wife isn't contributing as he'd like. He sought help from his mom, which his wife didn't want. \n\nIs he wrong for inviting his mom without his wife's consent? Well, in a marriage, major decisions should involve both partners. Inviting a parent into the home without the spouse's agreement could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting her wishes. But on the other hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed and trying to manage the situation. The wife's refusal to help is creating a stressful environment.\n\nThe husband tried to communicate and pleaded with his wife, but she didn't help. Maybe he should have tried other methods first, like counseling or setting boundaries. However, the situation had gotten to a point where he felt it was necessary to bring in help. \n\nThe wife's friend criticized him for \"undermining\" her, which adds another layer. The husband might be right in thinking he needed the help, but the way he did it without consulting his wife properly could be the issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He had a legitimate need for assistance, but the method he used might have been disrespectful. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process enough. But maybe B because his actions were driven by genuine stress and necessity. \n\nI think the key point is that he should have discussed it more thoroughly with his wife before acting. Inviting someone without her consent, even if it's for a good reason, can be seen as disrespectful. So the answer might be A. But others might argue it's B because the situation was desperate. Hmm.\n"
