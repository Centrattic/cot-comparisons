It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with them and their wife after having a child. The situation is that the author and their wife had a baby, but the wife isn't doing any housework besides baby-related tasks. The author is working 45 hours a week and handling all the chores, which is leading to exhaustion. They tried talking to their wife, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author then tells their mom about the situation, who offers to help, and the author invites her over without their wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the division of housework. The author is doing the majority, which is causing strain. The wife is not contributing, which the author finds unfair. The author communicated their needs but felt ignored, so they brought in their mom. The wife got angry, and the friend commented on the author undermining the wife.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. It's about whether the author overstepped by inviting their mom without the wife's consent. The author's intention was to get help because they were burnt out. The wife wanted to handle things themselves, even if that meant the author was overworked. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did express their concerns, but the wife wasn't willing to help. The author felt they had no other choice but to bring in their mom. However, inviting a family member into the home without the spouse's agreement can be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy, depending on cultural norms and the couple's dynamics. \n\nBut the author's actions were driven by their own well-being and the need to manage responsibilities. The mom's help actually alleviated the stress and allowed the author to have some time. The wife's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or having her autonomy ignored. However, the author's plea is about their own exhaustion and not being able to handle everything. \n\nThere's a balance between a couple's independence and seeking support. The author might not be in the wrong if the situation was dire and the spouse was uncooperative. But the method of inviting the mom without discussing it thoroughly with the wife could be problematic. Maybe the author should have tried more solutions first, like couples counseling or setting clearer boundaries, before involving a parent. \n\nHowever, the author had already tried pleading with their wife, and when that failed, they took action to prevent further burnout. The mom's presence is positive in terms of support, but the wife feels her needs aren't being respected. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the wife was open to help in general but just not from the author's mom, that's a different story. But the author's mom was offering to help, and the wife didn't want help at all, even though the author needed it. \n\nIn some cases, bringing in a parent for support is a common solution, especially in postpartum situations. The wife's resistance might be due to her own stress or feeling that the author isn't respecting her. The author's decision to invite the mom could be seen as a necessary step for their mental health and the family's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced. The main point is the author's need to manage their own stress and ensure the household functions, even if it means bringing in external help when the spouse is unwilling. However, the communication and approach could have been better. But given the circumstances, the author's actions were a response to being overwhelmed and not getting the support they needed.\n"
