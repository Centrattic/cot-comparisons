It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having their mom come stay with their wife after the birth of their child.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The author is doing most of the housework, with the wife only doing about 35% before the baby, and now almost nothing after. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and the wife is also exhausted but not contributing to housework. The author's mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when the author invites her without permission. The author goes ahead anyway, leading to tension.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and consent. Did the author communicate his struggles to his wife adequately before involving his mom? The author mentions he tried asking for help and expressing exhaustion, but the wife wasn't helping. The author then told his mom he'd arrange it with his wife, but when the wife refused, he went ahead anyway. \n\nRespecting boundaries is important in a relationship. By inviting his mom without his wife's consent, the author may have overstepped, even if the intention was good. The wife felt undermined, and the friend pointed out the strain this caused. However, the author was dealing with burnout and felt it was necessary. There's a balance between self-care and respecting a partner's feelings. \n\nBut from a relationship perspective, making a decision that affects the spouse without their agreement can be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have tried more to resolve the issue with his wife first, maybe seeking couples counseling or a compromise. Instead, he took unilateral action, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's need for help is valid. Postpartum challenges can be overwhelming, and the lack of support from the wife might have justified the action. However, the method of handling it might be where the fault lies.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intent was to alleviate his stress, but the way he did it without considering his wife's feelings could be problematic. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt her autonomy was disrespected. So, while the author's situation is understandable, the action of inviting his mom without consent might place him in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural context or other factors. In some cultures, involving family for support is common, but in relationships, communication is key. Since the wife had already refused, going against her wishes might not be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and acted unilaterally, even if the underlying issue was valid.\n"
