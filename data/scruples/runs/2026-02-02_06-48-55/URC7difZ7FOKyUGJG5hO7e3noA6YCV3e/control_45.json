It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with a newborn, where the husband feels he's doing all the housework, and the wife isn't helping. He then brings in his mom without the wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband works full-time, comes home to do all the chores, and the wife is supposedly taking care of the baby. The wife claims she's too tired, but the husband feels it's an 80/20 split. He reaches out to his mom for help, which the mom offers. When he mentions it to his wife, she gets angry and refuses. He proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week without improvement.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband is under a lot of stress. The wife not contributing to household tasks is causing strain. However, the key issue is that he went ahead without her agreement. Even though he tried to communicate his struggles, bringing in his mom might be seen as overstepping. It's possible that the wife felt her autonomy was invaded, especially if she wanted to handle things on their own.\n\nBut then, the husband's perspective is valid. He's overwhelmed and needs support. The mom's help does alleviate some of his burden. However, the method he used could be problematic. In relationships, communication and mutual agreement are crucial. Deciding unilaterally might undermine the wife's agency, even if the intention was good.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's reaction. Her being upset suggests that the method of introducing the mom without her consent caused more harm. Even if the help was beneficial, the process might have been handled better. The husband should have tried to resolve the issue through dialogue, maybe setting boundaries or seeking couples counseling instead of involving a parent without consent.\n\nHowever, considering the extreme stress and exhaustion, the husband's actions could be seen as a last resort. The wife's lack of cooperation despite multiple requests could justify his decision. The question is whether the means (inviting the mom without permission) were justified by the ends (his well-being and the baby's care).\n\nIn terms of relationship ethics, respecting each other's wishes is important. The husband's decision might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the outcome was positive. Alternatively, if the wife wasn't meeting basic household responsibilities, the husband might feel justified in seeking external help, especially from family who offered willingly.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's involvement. While her help is helpful, her cold and possessive behavior with the baby might be causing additional issues. The husband might not have considered how this would affect the wife's feelings, especially if she's already stressed.\n\nIn summary, the husband's intentions were to relieve his stress and ensure the baby is cared for, but the method of unilateral decision-making without considering his wife's feelings and autonomy could be seen as where he went wrong. However, the wife's lack of contribution and refusal to accept help also plays a role. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the husband being in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and potentially caused more conflict. But there's also a case for him acting in self-care. The key is the communication and consent aspect.\n"
