It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author inviting their mom to come stay and help with housework and the baby because their wife isn't contributing. The wife got angry when the mom arrived, but the author felt burnt out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their wife have a baby, and the wife isn't doing any housework beyond the baby's needs. The author is working 45 hours and handling all the chores. They tried talking to their wife, but she refuses to help, citing exhaustion. The author's mom offers to help, but the wife resists. The author then invites the mom over without the wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering what's right or wrong here. The author is trying to manage their household during a stressful time. They've already tried communicating with their wife but didn't get help. The mom's help is a solution to prevent burnout. However, inviting someone into the home without the spouse's consent could be seen as overstepping. The wife's autonomy in household decisions is important. Even if the author feels desperate, bypassing the wife's wishes might have caused more harm. The wife's friend points out the undermining, which is a valid point.\n\nBut also, the author is dealing with exhaustion and their wife isn't contributing. The housework imbalance is a legitimate issue. Maybe the author should have tried more communication or mediation before bringing in their mom. However, the situation might not be a clear-cut right or wrong. The author's actions were to relieve their own stress and possibly improve their marriage by reducing tension from chores, even if the method was abrupt.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the line is about respecting each other's boundaries. By bringing in their mom without consent, the author might have crossed that line, even with good intentions. So the answer might lean towards A (wrong), but there's nuance. On the other hand, if the wife was unresponsive and the author was at their breaking point, maybe B (not wrong). But the key is the decision to invite the mom without discussing further with the wife. Since the wife had already refused help, the author's action could be seen as disregarding her feelings. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
