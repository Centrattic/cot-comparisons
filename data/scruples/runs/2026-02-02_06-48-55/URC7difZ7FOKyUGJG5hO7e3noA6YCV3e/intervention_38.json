It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife after having a baby. Let me look at the details.\n\nSo, the couple had a baby four months ago. The husband mentions that even before the baby, the wife was doing about 35% of the housework, but now she's doing almost none, except for baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. He tried to ask for help, but she's not doing anything. He vented to his mom, who then decided to fly in from across the country to help. When he told his wife, she got angry and said they can handle it themselves. He then told his mom to come anyway after a week of no change. Now the wife is upset, and the mom is being cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The husband feels overwhelmed, which is understandable with a newborn. He's trying to manage work and all the household chores. His wife is also supposed to be taking care of the baby, which is a lot of work. But maybe she's not contributing to the housework. The problem is the division of labor here. The husband is doing 80% before the baby and now all of it, which is leading to burnout.\n\nNow, inviting his mom without the wife's consent\u2014was that right? Well, they are a couple, so decisions like this might need mutual agreement. The husband tried to communicate his needs and the wife didn't respond well. He felt he had to take action because he's reaching breaking point. But by bringing in his mom without consulting her properly, he might have overstepped. Even though his mom offered to help, the wife's feelings were hurt. The wife might feel disrespected or that her needs aren't being heard. The mom's arrival also caused tension, being cold and possessive of the baby, which adds stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband was trying to find a solution to his overwhelming situation. He did express his needs but didn't get the support he wanted. Maybe there's a communication issue here. But bringing in his mom without resolving that conflict could be seen as a lack of teamwork. The wife might feel that her partner isn't standing by her, especially if the mom's presence is making things worse. The friend's comment also suggests that the husband undermined his wife, which could affect their relationship negatively.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a tough call. He was trying to manage a stressful situation and sought help from his mom, but did so without considering his wife's perspective fully. Even though his intention was good, the method might have been flawed. He should have tried to reach a mutual agreement with his wife before bringing in his mom. Instead, he took unilateral action, which led to more conflict. The wife's feelings are valid; she might feel that her partner didn't trust her to handle the situation together. So, maybe the answer is A\u2014Yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate effectively and acted without considering his wife's feelings, leading to more problems.\n"
