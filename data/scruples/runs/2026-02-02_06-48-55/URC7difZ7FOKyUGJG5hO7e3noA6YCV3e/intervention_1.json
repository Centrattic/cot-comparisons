It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a new parent couple where the husband is doing most of the housework, the wife is overwhelmed with the baby, and the husband invites his mom to help without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, the husband feels he's doing 80% of the housework even after having a baby. He's tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping. He mentions his mom, who offers to come stay and help. When he tells his wife, she gets angry and refuses the help. Then he proceeds to invite his mom anyway when the situation doesn't improve. The wife is upset, and their friend comments on the husband undermining her.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband's main issue is the unequal distribution of chores. He's exhausted from work and taking care of the baby. The wife, on the other hand, is handling the baby full-time, which is also exhausting. She might feel that the husband isn't understanding her situation. When he brings in his mom without consulting her, it might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. Even though the husband felt he had no choice, the method of bringing in help without consent could be problematic. Communication is key in such situations. He tried talking, but maybe not enough. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her ability to manage was being doubted. The husband's action might have been necessary for his well-being, but the way he did it could have been handled better. So, he's in a tough spot, but maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because he didn't resolve it with his wife first. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he's dealing with burnout. But the key point is respecting the wife's autonomy. So, maybe A.\n"
