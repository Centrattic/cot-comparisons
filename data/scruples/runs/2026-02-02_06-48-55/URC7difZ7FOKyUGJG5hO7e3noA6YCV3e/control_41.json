It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after the birth of their child. The situation is that the wife isn't contributing to housework, the author is overwhelmed, and after trying to communicate, he brings in his mom without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's working 45 hours a week, does most of the housework, and after the baby, the wife does even less. He tried talking, but she's not helping. He feels burnt out and needed help, so he brings in his mom. His intention was to get support and maybe give the wife a break too.\n\nThe wife's perspective: she's taking care of the baby, which is exhausting. She might feel that the author isn't acknowledging her efforts or that her role is being undervalued. Bringing in his mom without her consent could make her feel disrespected or undermined, especially if she wanted to handle it on her own. The friend's comment about \"undermining her\" suggests that the wife felt her autonomy was violated.\n\nNow, the key points are communication and consent. The author tried to talk to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. However, deciding to bring in his mom without her approval might be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was good, not involving the wife in the decision could be a misstep. Partners should ideally make major decisions together, especially regarding family involvement in their home.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author was at the end of his rope. The housework imbalance was causing stress, and the wife wasn't willing to adjust. The mom's help provided necessary relief. Maybe the author did consider the wife's feelings but felt it was the only option left after repeated failures to communicate effectively.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between self-care and respecting each other's boundaries. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because he was seeking a solution to a real problem. However, the method of bringing in his mom without the wife's agreement could be problematic. It's possible that a different approach, like couples counseling or more structured communication, could have been tried first.\n\nBut given the circumstances\u2014exhaustion, lack of support from the wife, and the mom offering help\u2014it's understandable why the author felt compelled to act. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions, while perhaps hasty, were a necessary response to an unsustainable situation. The wife's reaction and the friend's comment suggest that the author's approach hurt her feelings, but the underlying issue of household responsibilities remains unresolved.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He might not be entirely at fault since he was trying to address a real issue, but he could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the focus is on the decision to bring in his mom without consent, that's a breach of partnership. But if the focus is on his need for help, then he's justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the situation was dire and the intent was to help, even if the method was flawed.\n"
