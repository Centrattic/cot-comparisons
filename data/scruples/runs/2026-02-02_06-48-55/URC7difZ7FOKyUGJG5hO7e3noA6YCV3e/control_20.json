It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author and their wife had a baby four months ago. The wife isn't doing any housework except for baby-related tasks. The husband is working 45 hours a week and comes home exhausted, but still ends up doing most of the chores. He's tried to ask for help, but the wife says she's too exhausted from taking care of the baby. The author then confided in his mom, who offered to come stay and help. When he suggested it to his wife, she got angry and said they can handle it. The husband then decided to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are communication, shared responsibilities, and boundaries between family members.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife have a history of unequal housework split, which the husband is okay with when it's just the two of them. After the baby, the wife isn't doing any housework, which is causing stress. The husband is already overworked and exhausted. He communicates his struggles, but the wife doesn't help. He reaches out to his mom for support, which the wife objects to. The husband then goes ahead without her consent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the husband had the right to invite his mom without the wife's permission. On one hand, the husband is trying to cope with stress and seeking help. On the other hand, bringing a parent into the situation without the spouse's consent might be a breach of trust or boundary. However, the husband has tried to communicate his needs, and the wife isn't addressing the issue. The mom's help is providing necessary relief. \n\nBut did he give his wife enough chance to adjust? The wife might be struggling with postpartum challenges, which the husband didn't consider. Maybe there's an underlying issue, like postpartum depression, that's affecting her ability to help. The husband's decision could be seen as selfish if he didn't fully understand her situation. However, if the wife is genuinely uncooperative despite his efforts, the husband is trying to find a solution. \n\nThe wife's friend's comment suggests that the husband's actions might have been perceived as undermining her. The wife is upset, so the husband's action might have hurt her feelings. However, the husband's main issue is the lack of support in household duties, which is affecting his well-being. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband tried to talk to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. Bringing in his mom might be a necessary step for his mental health and the well-being of the family. However, the method of doing so without discussing it thoroughly with his wife could be the issue. Maybe he should have tried more solutions before bringing in his mom, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to address his needs but might have overstepped by not respecting his wife's initial refusal. However, his actions are a response to her not helping. Maybe the root problem is the unequal distribution of housework and lack of support, which needs to be addressed together. The wife's anger might be about feeling criticized or unsupported, while the husband feels overwhelmed. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's actions might be inconsiderate in the way he brought in his mom without the wife's consent, his main issue is valid. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. But according to the question, is he in the wrong? The answer might lean towards A (Yes) because of the decision to invite the mom without consent, but B (No) because of the valid reasons. However, considering that he tried to communicate and the wife wasn't helping, maybe B is more appropriate.\n"
