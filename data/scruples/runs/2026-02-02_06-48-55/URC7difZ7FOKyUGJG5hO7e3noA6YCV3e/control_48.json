It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing his mom to come stay with them without his wife's permission. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a newborn, and the husband is doing almost all the housework, which is causing him stress. His wife isn't helping much, even after he's expressed his feelings. The mom offers help, but the wife is against it. The husband proceeds anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband did the right thing by bringing in his mom without his wife's consent. On one hand, he's overwhelmed and trying to manage, which makes sense. On the other hand, involving family without the spouse's consent can be seen as overstepping.\n\nBut let's break it down. The husband tried to communicate his needs and the wife didn't respond. He asked for help, which is valid. The mom offered to help, and he arranged it. The wife was already resistant, and the husband felt like he had no other choice. \n\nHowever, inviting someone into the home without the spouse's approval can be seen as undermining their authority, especially in a marriage. It might have been better to seek couples counseling or find a different solution before involving parents. But the husband's actions were driven by his need to manage the stress and his wife's refusal to help. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some cultures, family support is expected, so maybe it's more accepted. But generally, in a marriage, major decisions like having parents stay involve mutual agreement. The husband's actions could be seen as a lack of teamwork, but the wife's refusal to help is also a problem. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction is understandable because she might feel disrespected. However, the husband's stress and exhaustion are also valid. The outcome with the mom helping improved their situation, but the method of getting there caused marital tension. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. He acted out of necessity but didn't consider his wife's feelings. Maybe there's a middle ground, but given the circumstances, he might not be entirely at fault. Alternatively, he should have addressed the issue with counseling first. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband should have involved his mom without his wife's consent. Since the wife had already refused once, and he went ahead, that could be seen as the wrong move. However, his intentions were to alleviate his burden, which is understandable. But in a relationship, respecting each other's decisions is important. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting his wife's initial refusal. But then again, if the wife isn't willing to change her behavior despite his efforts, maybe the husband was justified. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn here. The key points are the husband's communication efforts and the wife's lack of response. Inviting family without consent might be a breach of trust. So answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no)? I think A because he didn't respect his wife's wishes, but B because the situation was dire. The community might split, but according to AITA standards, the husband might be at fault for not discussing more or finding another solution first.\n"
