It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their baby was born, despite their wife not wanting help. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple has a newborn, and the author is doing all the housework while the wife is taking care of the baby and not helping. The author works 45 hours a week, which isn't super long, but he's exhausted. He's tried talking to his wife about the workload, but she's refusing to help because she's too tired. The author's mom offers to come help, but the wife gets angry when he suggests it. Then, after the author threatens to bring her in anyway if things don't improve, the wife doesn't change her behavior, so the author invites his mom without the wife's permission. Now the wife is upset, and the author is getting social pressure from his wife's friend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's doing all the housework and work, leading to burnout. He's communicated his need for help, and the wife isn't responding. Maybe he feels like he's carrying all the physical load, which is unfair. Inviting his mom could be a way to alleviate that. But he went behind his wife's back, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nFrom the wife's side, she's dealing with a newborn, which is incredibly demanding. She might be physically and emotionally drained, which could explain why she's not doing housework. She might feel that the author is not acknowledging the invisible labor of childcare, which is just as exhausting. Also, inviting someone else into the home without consent can feel like an attack on her ability to manage the household and care for the baby. That could lead to resentment and conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did try to talk to his wife, but maybe not effectively. He could have tried more strategies to get her help, like specific requests or dividing tasks differently. However, the wife's refusal might be valid if she's truly overwhelmed. \n\nInviting his mom without the wife's permission seems like a problem. Even if the author felt desperate, it's important to respect his wife's boundaries. The wife's reaction could be part of feeling disrespected or undermined. The social dynamics here are complex. The author might think he's helping, but the method could have been better. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to prevent burnout and get help. On the other hand, he didn't respect his wife's wishes and boundaries, which is a significant issue. Relationships require negotiation and compromise. The fact that the wife was upset and the mom's presence has caused tension (like the wife being cold and possessive) suggests that the approach might not have been the best. \n\nBut maybe the wife is also not doing her part, but that's more about their relationship dynamics. The question is about the author's action of inviting the mom without consent. In that case, yes, he's making a choice that affects both his wife and their relationship, without her agreement. Even if he's justified in his reasoning, the action itself is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's boundaries, even if the situation was difficult. However, some might argue that he's in a tough spot and the action was necessary. But typically, in such scenarios, the consensus is that respecting the partner's wishes is crucial, even if the underlying issue isn't resolved. So, the answer is A.\n"
