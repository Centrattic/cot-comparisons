It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is sharing a situation where they and their wife had a baby, and the husband is doing all the housework. The wife isn't helping, which is causing stress. He then brings in his mom without the wife's permission, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband mentions that the wife has always been the lower contributor to housework, even before the baby. Now with the baby, she's doing even less. He tries to communicate his exhaustion, but she's not willing to help. He reaches out to his mom, who offers to help, but the wife objects. The husband then goes ahead and invites his mom anyway after a week.\n\nThe wife's reaction is anger and feeling undermined. The friend of the wife comments that the husband undermined her. So, from the wife's perspective, it's a breach of trust. The husband felt he had no other option because he was burnt out and his requests for help were ignored. \n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, maybe. Bringing in another person without discussing it properly with the wife could be seen as overstepping. Even though the wife wasn't helping, the husband might have needed to handle the situation differently. Maybe a better approach would have been to seek couples counseling or find another solution together before involving his mom. However, the husband's actions were driven by his own exhaustion and feeling unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband did communicate his needs multiple times. The wife's refusal to help might be contributing to the problem. The mom's help did provide relief, so maybe the husband was justified in seeking help when his wife wasn't cooperating. But bringing in his mom without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining the wife's autonomy and possibly causing more conflict.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The husband's actions were self-preservation, but the method might have been poor. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms. In some cases, involving family for support is common, but without mutual agreement, it can cause issues. The key is whether the husband handled it respectfully, which he might not have. So, I'm leaning towards the husband being at least partially in the wrong for not finding a better compromise before taking unilateral action.\n"
