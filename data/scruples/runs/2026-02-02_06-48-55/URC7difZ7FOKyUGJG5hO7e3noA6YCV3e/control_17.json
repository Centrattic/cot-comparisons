It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay after his wife wasn't helping with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the husband is doing almost all the housework, which he's been doing before, but now it's even worse. He's tried talking to his wife about it, but she's not helping. He mentions their housework split was already 80/20 in his favor, which he could live with when it was just the two of them. Now, with a baby, she's doing even less. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, and does all the chores. His mom offers to help, but the wife gets angry when he suggests it. He then proceeds to invite his mom anyway after a week of no change.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and shared responsibility. The husband tried talking to his wife, who's not contributing, and felt overwhelmed. He involved his mom as a solution. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, teamwork is crucial, especially during stressful times like having a baby. The wife's argument that she's too tired from the baby might be valid, but if she's not doing any housework, that's a problem. The husband's approach was to bring in his mom without his wife's consent, which could be seen as undermining her. However, he had tried to communicate and get help, which wasn't working. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She's upset because he went ahead without her permission, which can be seen as a breach of trust. But the husband was at his breaking point. The friend's comment that he \"undermined her\" suggests that there's a perception of disrespect towards his wife. However, if the wife isn't meeting her responsibilities, the husband might feel forced to act.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband didn't communicate effectively after the initial refusal. Maybe he should have tried another approach or sought counseling. But given the circumstances, his actions were driven by his need for support and the lack of help from his wife. On the other hand, inviting his mom without consent could be seen as overstepping, but if the wife wasn't willing to change her behavior, it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to find a solution after repeated attempts to fix the issue. However, the approach could have been better handled. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer hinges on whether his actions were justified given the context.\n"
