It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his wife had a baby, and the wife isn't helping with housework, so he invited his mom to stay to help. The wife was upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author mentions they have a good relationship, but the main issue is the split of housework, which was already 65/35 before the baby, now more like 80/20. The wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby, so she doesn't do any other chores. The author tried to ask for help, but she didn't, so he brought in his mom without her consent.\n\nNow, the key points. Did he wrong by inviting his mom without telling his wife first? Well, he did say he arranged it with his wife, but when he told her, she was angry. So he tried to communicate, but she didn't agree. Then he followed through anyway. That part might be the issue. He was trying to get help because he was exhausted, but he didn't consider that his wife might be hurt or feel disrespected by him bringing in his mom without her agreement.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize his needs? Maybe, but he was burnt out. However, the way he handled it could be problematic. He didn't maybe find a compromise. Like, maybe he could have communicated better or sought couples counseling first. Bringing in a parent without the spouse's consent might be seen as undermining the spouse, even if the intent was good. The wife's friend also commented on undermining her, which suggests that others might see it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife wasn't helping, and the author was at his breaking point. The mom's help was necessary to prevent burnout. So there's a balance between self-care and respecting the spouse's feelings. The question is whether the author was wrong in not respecting his wife's wishes versus the right to seek help when overwhelmed.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the question is AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he bypassed his wife's wishes. Even though the wife wasn't contributing, the method of handling it without her consent could be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
