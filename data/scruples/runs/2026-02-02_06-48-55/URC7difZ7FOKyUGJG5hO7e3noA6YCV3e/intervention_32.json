It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after his wife refused to help with housework post-baby. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband (author) and wife had a baby. The wife isn't helping with household chores, which she used to do a bit before. He's working 45 hours a week and feels overwhelmed. He asked his mom for help after venting, and she offered to come stay. He told his wife, who got angry and refused. He then went ahead and invited his mom anyway after a week of no change.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is trying to manage work, parenting, and all the chores. He's exhausted and seeking support. On the other hand, he didn't properly address the issue with his wife first. Instead of finding a solution together, he brought in his mom without her consent, which could be seen as undermining her.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. Did he try to resolve the problem through discussion? He mentions he's pleaded with her and tried to ask for help. But maybe he didn't address her feelings or the root of her exhaustion. Postpartum can be tough, and maybe she's dealing with her own stress, lack of sleep, or other issues that aren't immediately visible. Inviting his mom without her agreement might have caused more conflict and hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction\u2014being angry and upset\u2014suggests that she values autonomy in their parenting and household decisions. The husband's decision to go ahead without her input might have breached that trust. Even if his intention was good, the method could be problematic. It's important in relationships to collaborate on solutions rather than making unilateral decisions, especially regarding family members.\n\nHowever, the husband is clearly struggling and feeling overburdened. Maybe he felt he had no other option. But the right approach would have been to seek professional help, like counseling, or to negotiate a new division of labor post-baby. Bringing in a parent without consent might not have been the best approach, even if his mom's help is beneficial.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, while his situation is understandable, the way he handled it by involving his mom without his wife's consent might be the mistake. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not resolving the issue together first.\n"
