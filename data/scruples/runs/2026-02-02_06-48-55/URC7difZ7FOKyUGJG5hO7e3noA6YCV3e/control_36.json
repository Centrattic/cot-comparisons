It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and newborn without the wife's consent. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the husband is doing almost all the housework, which is causing him stress. He tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping, even after he expressed his exhaustion. His mom offers to help, but the wife is upset when he invites her. The husband then proceeds to invite the mom anyway when the wife doesn't change her behavior.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is handling all the housework plus work, which is leading to burnout. The wife is caring for the baby, which is also exhausting. There's a communication breakdown\u2014neither side is meeting the other's needs. The husband's action was to bring in his mom to help, which the wife found disrespectful. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. He tried to talk to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. Bringing in his mom without her consent might be seen as overstepping, especially if he didn't involve her in the decision. However, his motivation was to alleviate his own stress and the household's situation, which is understandable. The wife's reaction is also valid because she feels her autonomy is being disregarded. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of unilaterally deciding to bring in his mom, he could have tried to find another solution with his wife, like a therapist or mediation. Still, the situation was leading to his burnout, and the mom's help was a practical solution. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband's action was wrong. On one hand, he acted without his wife's consent, which could be seen as undermining her. On the other hand, he was overwhelmed and tried to find a solution. The answer might depend on cultural norms too\u2014some view in-laws helping as natural, others not so much. \n\nI think the key is the lack of communication and mutual problem-solving. The husband should have discussed the decision more thoroughly with his wife before acting. But his intent was to help the situation, not to be malicious. The wife's reaction is also a valid response to being undermined. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. But since he acted without considering her feelings and autonomy, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). However, another perspective is that he was trying to solve a problem that she wasn't addressing. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (No), because his action was driven by necessity and he had tried to communicate before. But the method of acting without consent could be wrong. This is tricky. I need to decide based on the typical standards of AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads. Often, acting without communication can be seen as the problem. So maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
