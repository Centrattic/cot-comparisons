It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby. The situation is that the author and their wife are both exhausted, but the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The author tried to communicate their feelings, but the wife isn't helping, so the author brought in their mom without the wife's permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing all the housework, which is leading to burnout. They tried to talk to their wife, who is also tired from taking care of the baby. The author's mom offered help, and the author decided to bring her in without the wife's consent. The wife got angry because she felt it was an overstep.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to talk to their wife, but maybe not effectively. The wife might feel that the author is dismissing her effort or not recognizing her role in caring for the baby. The author's action of bringing in the mom without consent could be seen as undermining the wife's autonomy. However, the author is also struggling with exhaustion and needing support.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she might feel that her exhaustion is being invalidated. The author's mom's presence could be seen as helpful but also intrusive. The wife's coldness towards the baby might indicate discomfort with her mother-in-law's influence.\n\nLegally or morally, there's no clear right or wrong, but in terms of relationship dynamics, making unilateral decisions without considering the partner's feelings can cause resentment. The author might have acted out of necessity but didn't address the underlying issues between them and their wife first. The correct approach might have been to seek couples counseling or find a compromise rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't adequately address the issues with their wife before taking action, leading to conflict. But also, the wife's lack of help is a problem. However, the question is about the author's actions. Since they bypassed their wife's wishes, they share some responsibility.\n"
