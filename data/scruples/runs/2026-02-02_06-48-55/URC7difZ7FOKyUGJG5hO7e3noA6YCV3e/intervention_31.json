It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for letting his mom come stay with them after having a baby. The situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago, and the wife isn't doing any housework outside of baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week and does all the housework, which is causing him to be exhausted. He tried talking to his wife about it, but she says she's too tired. His mom offered to help, and when the wife was against it, he went ahead and invited her anyway, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The main issue is the division of labor in the household. The author is doing the majority of the housework, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. The wife is handling the baby during the day, which is also a significant responsibility. However, the author's argument is that even if she did a small amount of housework, it would make a big difference. The wife, on the other hand, feels she's already exhausted from the baby and doesn't want to do anything else. \n\nNow, the author's decision to bring in his mom without the wife's consent is the key point. The wife had explicitly said they didn't need help, and the friend's comment suggests that the wife is upset about being undermined. The author's reasoning is that he needed help and couldn't get it from his wife, so he turned to his mom. But bringing in a third party, especially a parent, without the spouse's agreement can be seen as overstepping. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and find solutions together. The author did try to talk to his wife, but perhaps didn't address her feelings adequately. The wife might feel that the author is not respecting her autonomy or her current state of being overwhelmed. Even if the intention was to relieve stress, doing so without mutual consent could damage trust. \n\nHowever, the author's burnout is a valid concern. New parents often face challenges with household responsibilities and may feel overwhelmed. The mom's help might have been necessary to prevent the author from becoming too exhausted. The question is whether the method of inviting the mom without the wife's permission was wrong. \n\nIn some cultures, involving parents for help is common and accepted. But in this case, the wife's reaction indicates a problem. The author's response to the friend's comment was to say it's between him and his wife, which might not resolve the underlying issue. The wife might feel that her partner didn't stand by her or consider her feelings, leading to resentment. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because he didn't respect his wife's initial refusal. But he might also be justified if he felt there was no other way to get the support he needed and the situation was unsustainable. The rightness or wrongness might depend on how they communicate and resolve the issue moving forward. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision to bring in his mom without the wife's consent might be where he's in the wrong. Even if the intention was good, the approach could have been better by involving the wife more or finding another solution together. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I should also consider if there's any nuance where the wife's lack of cooperation left no choice. However, the fact that the author didn't honor his wife's wishes could be the main issue here.\n"
