It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by inviting his mom to stay with his wife after a conflict about housework. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The wife isn't contributing much to housework, and the author is overwhelmed with work and taking care of the baby and chores. The author's mom offers to help by staying for a couple of weeks, but the wife is upset when the author arranges it without her permission. The author then invites the mom anyway after a week of no change.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's doing most of the housework, which is causing stress. His mom offered help, which seems like a good solution. But he didn't discuss it with his wife first. The wife's reaction is negative, feeling undermined. The author's intention was to relieve stress, but his method might have been disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's point of view is that she's exhausted from taking care of the baby, which is valid. She might feel that her partner isn't acknowledging her efforts or that the mom's presence is intrusive. The author didn't consult her, which could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership.\n\nKey factors: Communication is a big issue here. The author didn't talk it over with his wife before making the decision. Even if he was overwhelmed, involving her in the decision-making might have been better. Also, the wife's exhaustion is a legitimate factor; maybe she needed rest too, but in a different way.\n\nHowever, the author is also under a lot of stress, working full-time and handling all the housework. The mom's help provided some relief. The question is about whether inviting the mom without discussing it first was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, mutual agreement is usually important for major decisions. The author's action might have been well-intentioned, but the method could have been better. There's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy\u2014deciding to bring in family without her input might feel disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting his wife first, even if the intention was good. The solution should have involved both partners discussing and agreeing on a plan. The wife's upset reaction is understandable because it's her home and her relationship with the author, and involving family without her consent could strain their partnership.\n"
