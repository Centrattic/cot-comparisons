It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after having a baby. The wife is not helping with housework, and the author feels overwhelmed. They tried talking to their wife but didn't get support, so they brought in their mom without the wife's approval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing all the housework, which is causing stress. The wife isn't contributing, even when asked. The mom steps in to help, but the wife is upset about it. The author's decision to invite the mom might be seen as a solution to their problem, but it could also be seen as undermining the wife's autonomy.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to manage a stressful situation and get help. They communicated their issues to the wife without success, so bringing in their mom might be a reasonable step to prevent burnout. On the other hand, not consulting the wife and going ahead might have caused additional strain in their marriage. The wife's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or that her needs weren't considered.\n\nI should also think about cultural factors. In some cultures, involving family for support is common and accepted. However, the wife's relationship with her mother-in-law might play a role. The wife and the author have a good relationship, but the wife's friendship with the mom is positive too. Still, the way the author acted without considering the wife's feelings could be problematic.\n\nThe key points are about communication and mutual respect. The author should have addressed the issue with the wife more effectively, perhaps seeking couples counseling or a compromise. Inviting the mom without the wife's consent might have been a last resort, but it's possible the author didn't give the wife enough opportunity to adjust or find a solution together.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a balance. The author's intentions were good, but the method might have been flawed. They might not be entirely in the wrong because the situation was stressful and they needed help, but they could have handled it differently. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether the action of inviting the mom without consent is considered a breach of trust or marital cooperation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as understandable given the circumstances but not entirely without fault. However, the primary issue is the wife's lack of contribution and the author's need for support. The answer could lean towards 'not in the wrong' because the author was trying to resolve a legitimate problem, even if the approach wasn't perfect.\n"
