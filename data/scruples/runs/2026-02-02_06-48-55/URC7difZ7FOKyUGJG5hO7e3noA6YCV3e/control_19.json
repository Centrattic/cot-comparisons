It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He's been doing most of the housework, even after work, while the wife is taking care of the baby during the day. He's exhausted because he's working 45 hours and handling all the chores and the baby when he gets home. He tried to talk to his wife about needing help, but she says she's too tired from the baby. Then he tells his mom, who offers to come stay for a few weeks to help out. The author arranges for his mom to come without his wife's approval, which makes his wife angry. The author then proceeds to bring his mom in, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, communication is key. The author did try to talk to his wife about the issue, but maybe not effectively. He mentions pleading with her to help, but she still didn't contribute. However, when he decided to bring in his mom without her consent, that might have been a mistake. Even if he felt desperate, involving an external family member without discussing it thoroughly with his wife could be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting her autonomy in their household decisions.\n\nAlso, the wife might feel that her needs as a new mother aren't being acknowledged. Taking care of a newborn is demanding, and she might be dealing with postpartum fatigue or other challenges that aren't immediately visible. The author's mom being possessive of the baby and the wife's emotional reaction could be signs that this external help isn't the best solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed and needs support. Maybe the problem is the approach he took. Instead of inviting his mom without discussing it, he could have sought counseling or mediation to address the household responsibilities more effectively with his wife. There's a balance between self-care and respecting a partner's boundaries.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to alleviate his stress, the method of bringing in a parent without mutual agreement might be where he went wrong. It's important to address household responsibilities as a team, ensuring both partners agree on solutions. The wife's feelings of being undermined and the subsequent conflict suggest that the author's actions, though well-meaning, may have been tactless. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe in some contexts, external help is necessary when communication fails, but typically, involving family without consent can complicate things. So leaning towards A.\n"
