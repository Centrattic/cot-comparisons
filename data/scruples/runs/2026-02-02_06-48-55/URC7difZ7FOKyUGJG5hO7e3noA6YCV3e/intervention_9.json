It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay with them after their wife refused. The main issue is the division of housework, with the husband doing most of it and the wife not contributing as much, leading to exhaustion. The husband tried talking to his wife, but she didn't help, so he invited his mom without consulting her, which upset the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The husband did discuss his struggles with his wife, but when she didn't respond, he went to his mom. Maybe he should have tried more direct communication before bringing in family. Inviting his mom without his wife's consent might be seen as undermining her, especially since the wife had previously rejected the idea. The wife's reaction\u2014being angry and upset\u2014suggests that the husband's action hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed. The wife's refusal to help with housework beyond baby-related tasks is causing significant stress. The husband's mom stepping in provided necessary support. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but maybe the husband had valid reasons for feeling like he needed help. \n\nHowever, the key point might be the lack of mutual agreement. The husband didn't resolve the issue through open dialogue with his wife before taking unilateral action. Even if the wife wasn't contributing, the husband's solution of bringing in his mom without her okay could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. The friend's comment about undermining the wife supports that perspective. \n\nBut then again, if the husband is at his breaking point and the wife isn't listening, is it wrong to seek help? It's a balance between respecting the wife's feelings and addressing his own needs. The husband's approach might have been hasty. He could have tried more to negotiate or find a compromise with his wife before involving his mom. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the husband's intention was to get help, which is understandable. But the method\u2014inviting his mom without consent\u2014might have been inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural context or relationship dynamics, but in many cases, such a decision would require mutual agreement. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not handling it through better communication first.\n"
