It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for allowing their mom to stay with them after their wife refused. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. He mentions that the wife has always done less housework, maybe around 20-35%, but now with the baby, she's not doing any. The author is working 45 hours and coming home to do all the chores. He tried asking for help, but the wife says she's too tired from the baby. The author's mom offers to help after he vents, but when he asks the wife, she gets angry and refuses. The author then invites his mom without his wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author felt overwhelmed and needed support. His mom offered help, and he felt that inviting her was necessary to manage. However, the wife felt disrespected and upset because her partner didn't consult her properly or consider her feelings before bringing in a parent.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about needing help and feeling that he's doing everything, which can lead to burnout. The wife's perspective is about her autonomy and feeling undermined when her partner made a decision without her agreement. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author tried talking to his wife, but maybe not effectively. Instead of escalating without discussion, perhaps a better approach would have been to seek couples counseling or find another way to compromise. Bringing in his mom without ensuring mutual agreement might have been a breach of trust, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author was dealing with exhaustion and the wife wasn't helping. The mom's help provided necessary relief. However, the method of inviting the mom without the wife's consent could be seen as disrespectful. The wife might have felt that her opinion wasn't valued, leading to resentment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between his need for support and respecting his wife's feelings. The answer might depend on cultural context too, but generally, making a unilateral decision after the other person refused could be problematic. The author should have found another way to address the issue rather than bypassing his wife's wishes. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance here. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the act of inviting without agreement could be considered wrong regardless of the reason.\n"
