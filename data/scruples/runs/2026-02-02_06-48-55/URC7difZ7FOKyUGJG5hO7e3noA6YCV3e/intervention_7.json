It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is a guy who had a baby four months ago with his wife. They had a housework split where he does most of it, even before the baby. Now, with the baby, his wife is doing almost nothing except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too tired from taking care of the baby.\n\nHe vents to his mom, who offers to come stay for a couple of weeks to help. He tells his wife, who gets angry and says they don't need help. He then tells his wife that if things don't change, he'll bring his mom in without her permission. After a week of no change, he brings his mom anyway. The wife is upset, and during a lunch with a friend, the friend comments on him undermining his wife.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me think about the key points.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife are a team, and communication is key in such situations. The husband tried to talk to his wife about the housework issue, but she wasn't helping. He felt overwhelmed and decided to bring in his mom to help. However, he didn't consult his wife properly or maybe not at all after she objected. The husband's action of bringing his mom without his wife's consent could be seen as undermining her, especially if the wife felt it was an invasion or a lack of trust in their ability to handle things. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband was clearly exhausted, and the wife wasn't contributing, leading to a possible imbalance in their household responsibilities. The mom's help was a practical solution, but the way it was introduced might have caused more conflict. The husband's decision to go ahead despite his wife's objections might have been necessary for his well-being, but the method could have been better. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband was wrong to bring his mom in without his wife's agreement after she refused. Some might argue that he had a right to seek help when his wife wasn't supporting him, especially since the wife was also overwhelmed but not contributing to household tasks. Others might say that he should have tried to resolve it within their marriage first, perhaps through couples counseling or more open communication, rather than bringing in an external person. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she felt disrespected, and the friend's comment implies that the husband's action was seen as undermining his wife's autonomy. However, the husband's perspective is that he was trying to manage his own stress and maintain household stability. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have a role in managing household tasks, especially with a newborn. The wife's refusal to help, despite the husband's exhaustion, might indicate a breakdown in communication or differing expectations. The husband's decision to involve his mom could be a valid solution if the wife wasn't willing to address the issue. However, the way he did it without mutual agreement might have been the mistake.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The husband's intention was to alleviate his own stress and improve their situation, which is understandable. But the method\u2014inviting his mom without his wife's consent after she had already rejected the idea\u2014might be seen as overstepping, especially if the wife felt her wishes were disregarded. However, given the wife's lack of support, the husband might have felt it was the only option. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband might not be entirely in the wrong because he was trying to solve a problem that his wife wasn't addressing. However, the approach could have been better, which might mean he's partially at fault. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong at all, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to manage his situation with the resources he had, even if the method was flawed.\n"
