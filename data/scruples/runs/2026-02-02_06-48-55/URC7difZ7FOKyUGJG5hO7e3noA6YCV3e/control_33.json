It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife had a baby four months ago. The main issue is the division of household chores. The author says he does 80% of the work, while the wife does 20%, but after the baby, she's doing almost none except for baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours a week and is exhausted when he comes home, doing all the housework. He's asked his wife for help, but she says she's too tired from taking care of the baby. The author then brings in his mom without his wife's permission, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to bring his mom without consulting his wife. Even though the mom offered help, bringing someone into the home without mutual agreement can be problematic. The wife was clearly upset and said they didn't need help. The author should have tried to resolve the issue between himself and his wife first before involving a third party. \n\nThe wife might feel disrespected or undermined because her partner made a decision without her consent. Even if the intentions were good, the method might have been poor. The author's action could be seen as a lack of communication or not respecting his wife's wishes. However, the author is also under a lot of stress and exhaustion, which might have influenced his decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't contributing to household work, which is causing the author significant stress. The author might feel that he's the only one handling both work and home, leading to burnout. The mom's help provided some relief, which is understandable. But the way he went about it without considering his wife's feelings could be the issue.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making. The author should have discussed with his wife again, maybe sought couples counseling or found a compromise. Inviting his mom without her knowledge could be seen as overstepping, even if the mom was willing to help. The wife's reaction of being extremely upset and the friend's comment about undermining her suggest that the author's actions hurt their relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have roles here. The author's stress is valid, but he should have addressed it through dialogue rather than unilateral action. The wife's lack of contribution is also an issue, but the author could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong specifically for inviting his mom without permission. Since he didn't consult his wife and acted on his own, it's likely he's at fault here. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
