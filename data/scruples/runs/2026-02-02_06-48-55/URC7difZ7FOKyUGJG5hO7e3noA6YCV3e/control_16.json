It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for inviting their mom to stay with their wife and newborn without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the division of household responsibilities. The author mentions that their wife isn't contributing much to the housework, which is causing him to be overwhelmed, especially after work. He's tried communicating this, but she's not helping, citing exhaustion from taking care of the baby. He then reaches out to his mom, who offers to help, and when he brings it up to his wife, she's upset and refuses the help. Despite that, the author goes ahead and invites his mom anyway.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. The author did express his feelings and tried to talk to his wife about the workload, but she wasn't receptive. He then made a decision to bring in his mom as a solution. However, doing so without his wife's consent might be seen as undermining her, especially since he mentioned he told her he would do it with or without her permission. That could definitely cause tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly stressed and overworked, both from his job and the household. The wife's refusal to share the load is leading to burnout. His mom's help is providing necessary relief. The question is whether the author overstepped by not respecting his wife's initial refusal. \n\nBut wait, the wife's argument was that they could handle it themselves. The author felt that they couldn't, leading to his decision to bring in his mom. This is a conflict in perspectives. In terms of fault, it's tricky. The author did communicate his struggle, but perhaps didn't work through it with his wife more thoroughly before taking unilateral action. However, if the wife is unwilling to compromise or help, the author might have felt it was the only option to get support. \n\nIn many cases, involving family for help in such situations is common, but doing it without the partner's agreement could be seen as insensitivity. However, given the circumstances of exhaustion and lack of support, some might argue it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were necessary and respectful of his wife's autonomy. Since he did try to communicate but felt ignored, his decision to act might be seen as a last resort. However, the method of acting without her consent could be problematic. But in the context of his stress and the lack of resolution, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's trying to address a real problem that's affecting his well-being and family life. The wife's refusal to share responsibilities is part of the issue here. So maybe the answer is B (No). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any key points. The friend's comment about undermining the wife is a point against the author, but the author's perspective is about his own well-being. It's a tough call, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he tried to communicate and felt it was necessary for his well-being, B might be the right answer.\n"
