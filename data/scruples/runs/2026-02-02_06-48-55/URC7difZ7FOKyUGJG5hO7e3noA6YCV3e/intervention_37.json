It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for letting their mom stay with their wife and newborn without the wife's consent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband feels overburdened with housework, as the wife isn't contributing beyond baby-related tasks. He tried to communicate, but she's not helping. The mom offers to help, but the wife is against it. The husband then brings in the mom without the wife's approval, leading to conflict.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Communication**: Did the husband address the issue with his wife before involving his mom? The post says he tried asking her for help and expressed exhaustion. The wife's response was that she's also exhausted. The husband tried pleading, but she still didn't help. So there's been communication, but maybe not enough or effective.\n2. **Respect for Wife's Autonomy**: The wife was upset when the mom arrived. Bringing in a parent without the spouse's consent can be a big deal. Even if the mom's help is beneficial, it might undermine the wife's feelings of autonomy and agency in her own household.\n3. **Impact on the Relationship**: The wife feels undermined, and the friend's comment highlights that. The husband's approach might have been a solution to his problem but at the expense of the wife's feelings and their relationship dynamic.\n4. **Cultural or Family Norms**: In some cultures, it's common for extended family to help, but in others, it might not be. Since the wife always had a good relationship with the mom, maybe the issue isn't with the mom but the process of involving her without consent.\n5. **Emotional Labor and Burnout**: The husband is clearly burnt out, which is a valid concern. However, solving it by unilaterally bringing in help might not address the underlying communication issues between the couple.\n6. **Long-term Solutions**: The situation might require couples counseling or a better communication strategy rather than introducing a third party without consent.\n\nPossible angles where the author is in the wrong (A):\n- Involved his mom without his wife's consent, which could be seen as dismissive of her input and feelings.\n- Undermined the wife's authority in their household decisions.\n- Possibly created tension between the wife and her in-law, which can complicate the marriage further.\n\nPossible angles where the author is not in the wrong (B):\n- The wife isn't contributing to housework, leading to burnout for the husband.\n- The husband tried to communicate but had no success, so he took matters into his own hands to improve his well-being.\n- The mom's help is beneficial, and the husband's action was to alleviate his own and the family's stress.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. The key here is the respect for the wife's autonomy and the process of decision-making. Even if the help is needed, involving a parent without the spouse's consent can be a breach of trust and partnership. The husband's response to \"just get on with it\" after the wife's anger might indicate a lack of empathy towards her feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and undermined her in their relationship.\n"
