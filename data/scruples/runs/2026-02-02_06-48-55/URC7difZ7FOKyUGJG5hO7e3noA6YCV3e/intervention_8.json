It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting their mom to stay after their wife wasn't helping with housework after having a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his wife had a baby four months ago. They had a housework split that was already skewed towards him (like 65/35 or even 80/20) before the baby. Now, since the baby, the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The author works 45 hours a week, comes home exhausted, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too tired. He tried to ask for help but she didn't contribute. Then, he told his mom, who offered to come stay for a couple of weeks to help. When he told his wife, she got angry and refused help. He then proceeded to invite his mom anyway, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I need to think about the dynamics here. \n\nOn one hand, the author is overwhelmed. The wife's refusal to help is making life difficult. The mom's help was a way to get relief. But on the other hand, he didn't consult his wife, and his mom's arrival made his wife upset. The wife might feel disrespected or that her feelings weren't considered. \n\nBut also, the wife's behavior is contributing to the problem. She's not helping with anything, leading the author to take on more than he can handle. The author tried to communicate and didn't get a response, so he took action. The problem is that he didn't consider the wife's feelings first, maybe. But was it necessary? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to talk to his wife but didn't get the support he needed. He might feel that he's at his breaking point. However, bringing in his mom without his wife's consent could be seen as an overstepping, especially if the wife had already expressed not needing help. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mom being cold and possessive of the baby, which might complicate things further. The author might not have anticipated how the wife would react or how the mom's behavior would affect the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he tried to address a problem that was causing him significant stress. The wife's lack of cooperation is a valid issue. However, the way he handled it by not consulting her further and just going ahead with the mom's visit could be seen as inconsiderate. He might have needed to find another solution first or have a more in-depth conversation with his wife before taking that step. \n\nBut given the circumstances, he was at a point where he felt he couldn't handle it anymore. So, maybe he's not entirely wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations too. In some cultures, involving family for support is common. However, the key point is whether he respected his wife's wishes. Since she was against it and he proceeded anyway, that could be a point against him. \n\nBut the wife's behavior was also problematic. If she's not contributing, the author has a right to seek help. The conflict arises from the lack of communication and compromise. Maybe the author's intentions were good, but the method was flawed. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect his wife's wishes, even if the situation was difficult. However, others might argue that the wife's lack of contribution justified his actions. It's a tough one, but leaning towards A because he didn't handle it collaboratively.\n"
