It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting his mom stay with them after their baby was born. The situation is that the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks, the husband is doing almost everything else, and after venting to his mom, he invited her to stay without his wife's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband feels overburdened, and the wife is not contributing to household chores. He's tried asking her for help but she's not cooperating. The mom offered to help, which he's grateful for, but the wife was upset when he went ahead without her permission. The key points here are communication, consent, and shared responsibilities in a marriage.\n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as a breach of trust because he didn't get his wife's agreement before inviting his mom. Even though the wife was resistant to help, the husband should have discussed this more thoroughly with her, possibly seeking mediation or couples counseling before making a unilateral decision. Bringing in a parent without consent can create tension and may be perceived as undermining the wife's authority in the household, especially if the mom is now being protective of the baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed, and the wife isn't sharing the workload. This is a common issue in new parent relationships. The husband's intention was to get help, but the method might have been flawed. He didn't give his wife enough opportunity to adjust or perhaps he didn't realize the emotional impact of bringing in his mom without her input.\n\nThe wife's reaction of being angry and feeling undermined is valid, as introducing the mother-in-law without her consent could be seen as a violation of their partnership. The husband's decision to proceed despite her objections shows a lack of collaboration, which is important in a marriage. Even if the outcome was beneficial for him, the process lacked mutual agreement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's actions, while coming from a place of need, were done without proper communication and consent. This makes him at fault for not handling the situation collaboratively. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
