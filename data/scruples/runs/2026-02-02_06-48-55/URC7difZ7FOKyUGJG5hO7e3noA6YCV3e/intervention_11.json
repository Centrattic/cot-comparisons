It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after they had a baby, despite the wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the division of household responsibilities. The author mentions that before the baby, the split was 80/20 in his favor, and after the baby, the wife stopped doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The author is working 45 hours a week and comes home to do all the chores. He's tried communicating his exhaustion and asking for help, but the wife responds that she's too tired from the baby. \n\nNext, the author reaches out to his mom, who offers to help. He then proceeds to invite her without the wife's consent, leading to conflict. The wife is upset, and the author's mom becomes possessive of the baby, which adds another layer of tension. The author's reasoning is that he needed help and couldn't handle everything alone, so he took action.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author did communicate his struggles to his wife, but she didn't provide the support he needed. He then seeks external help from his mom, which is a valid step if the couple isn't resolving the issue. However, inviting someone into the home without the spouse's consent can be seen as overstepping. The author might have handled it differently by perhaps setting clearer boundaries with his wife first or finding a compromise. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed and the wife isn't contributing as he feels necessary. The mom's help does provide relief, which is a positive outcome. The key question is whether the author was wrong in not respecting his wife's wishes by bringing in the mom. If the wife's decision to handle things alone is causing harm to the author's well-being and the marriage, then seeking external support might be justified. However, the method of doing so without mutual agreement could be problematic.\n\nIn some cases, couples might need mediation or counseling, but the author might not have considered that. The answer hinges on whether the author had a right to unilaterally decide to bring in the mom when communication wasn't working. If the author had a prior agreement with the mom or if the situation was an emergency, that's different. Here, it seems like a gradual build-up of stress, and while the action might be understandable, the approach could have been more collaborative. So, there's a case for both sides. But given the context, the author's intention was to alleviate his burden, which is relatable, but the method might have been flawed. However, I think the answer leans towards 'No' because the author was trying to address a real problem that wasn't being resolved through communication with his wife.\n"
