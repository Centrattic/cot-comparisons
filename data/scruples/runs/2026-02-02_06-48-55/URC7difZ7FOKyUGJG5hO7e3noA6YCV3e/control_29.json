It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing their mom to stay with their wife after having a baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband is doing almost all the housework, which was a problem even before the baby. Now, with the baby, the wife isn't doing any housework except baby-related tasks. The husband is exhausted from work and the chores. He vents to his mom, who offers to help. The wife is upset when he tells her and eventually the husband brings the mom in without her approval. The wife gets angry and their mom becomes cold and possessive of the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are the division of labor, communication between the couple, and the decision to bring in the mom. The husband tried to talk to his wife about the workload, but she wasn't helping. He then went to his mom for support. When the wife didn't agree, he proceeded anyway, which led to her anger.\n\nNow, determining if the author is at fault. The husband did try to communicate and address the issue. The wife isn't contributing to household tasks, which is causing him stress. Bringing in his mom might be a solution to share the burden, but the way he did it without the wife's consent could be a problem. However, the wife's refusal to help and not addressing the issue might have left him with no other option. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have shared some blame. The husband could have tried more communication before taking action, but the wife wasn't cooperating. However, since he did attempt to resolve it and the wife was dismissive, perhaps the husband is justified in seeking help. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to alleviate his stress and the wife wasn't helping. But there's also the aspect of not discussing it thoroughly with his wife first. \n\nBut given the context, he tried to talk to her, she refused to help, and then he went ahead. The key issue is whether he had a right to bring in his mom without her approval. If the wife felt it was a breach of trust, that's a problem. However, the husband's main issue was being overwhelmed and not getting help. Since the wife wasn't contributing and the situation wasn't improving, his actions might be seen as necessary. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
