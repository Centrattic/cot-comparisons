It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for inviting his mom to stay with his wife and him after having a baby, despite his wife's initial resistance.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband and wife have a newborn. The husband works 45 hours a week and does most of the housework, which was already an issue before the baby. Now, with the baby, the wife isn't contributing at all, just taking care of the baby. The husband is exhausted, tried to communicate, but the wife isn't helping. He reaches out to his mom, who offers to help. When he brings her in without his wife's consent, the wife gets upset.\n\nSo, key points to consider: Communication between the husband and wife. Did he try enough to address the issue before bringing in his mom? The husband mentions he's tried asking for help and explained his exhaustion. The wife's response is that she's too tired from the baby. But maybe he didn't address the root cause. Maybe the wife feels overwhelmed and the husband didn't consider her feelings or the baby's needs. \n\nThen, the husband invited his mom without his wife's permission. That's where the conflict lies. The wife felt undermined. Inviting a family member without consent might be seen as overstepping, especially in a marriage where communication is supposed to be key. The husband might have thought it was necessary because he was burnt out, but the method of involving the mom without discussion could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife isn't contributing at all, leading to the husband's exhaustion. The mom's help was a relief. But the way he handled it could have been better. Maybe he should have tried more to find a compromise with his wife, like couples counseling or a mediator, instead of bringing in his mom unilaterally. \n\nAlso, the wife's friend's comment about undermining her suggests that the method of inviting the mom without her consent might have hurt the wife's feelings. Respect in a marriage involves involving each other in decisions, especially when it affects family dynamics. The husband's action might have been necessary for his well-being, but the approach could be seen as dismissive of his wife's feelings. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: The husband was in a tough spot, but the way he resolved it might be where he's at fault. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't include his wife in the decision, leading to her upset. However, if the alternative is that the wife isn't contributing and he's suffering, maybe he's not wrong. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The main issue here is the lack of communication and mutual decision-making. Inviting the mom without discussing it thoroughly with his wife might be the wrong move, even if the intention was good.\n"
