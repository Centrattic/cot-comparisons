It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having his mom stay with them after his wife wasn't helping with housework. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a baby four months ago. The husband says he's doing most of the housework, which he's okay with when it was just them two, but since the baby, the wife is doing almost none except baby-related tasks. He works 45 hours, comes home tired, does all the chores, and the wife says she's too exhausted from the baby. He tried talking to her, but she refuses to help. Then he brings in his mom without his wife's permission after she initially refused. The wife gets upset, and the mom is cold and possessive. The friend comments that the husband undermined his wife, which he dismisses.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and boundaries. The husband felt overwhelmed and sought help from his mom because he couldn't get support from his wife. But he did so without his wife's consent after she had already rejected the idea. Even though his intention was to alleviate his own stress and maybe help his wife, bypassing her decision could be seen as undermining her, especially if she felt strongly about handling things themselves.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is dealing with a significant workload and might feel that the situation isn't sustainable. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her autonomy in the relationship is being disregarded. The husband's approach of inviting his mom without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust, even if his intentions were good. The wife's reaction indicates that she values her independence and might feel that her partner isn't supporting her in managing the household, which could have been addressed through better communication rather than unilateral decisions.\n\nThe friend's comment also points out that the husband's action might have made the wife feel disrespected. In relationships, respect for each other's decisions and boundaries is crucial. Even if the husband felt desperate, the right approach might have been to seek a compromise or find another solution together, rather than bringing in external help without her agreement. The husband's actions, while motivated by his own exhaustion, might have been perceived as dismissive of his wife's feelings and autonomy.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect his wife's wishes and acted unilaterally, which could damage trust and cooperation in the relationship. Even if the outcome was helpful for him, the method used might have been inappropriate.\n"
