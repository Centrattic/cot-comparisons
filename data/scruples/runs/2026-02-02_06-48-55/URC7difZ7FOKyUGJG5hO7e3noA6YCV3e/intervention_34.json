It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any. Mom offered to come help, wife didn't want her, I invited her anyway after feeling extremely burnt out.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author inviting their mom to stay with their wife and them after the birth of their child because the wife isn't helping with household chores.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and wife have a baby, and the author is doing most of the housework, which is causing him stress. He tried talking to his wife, but she's not helping, citing being too tired from taking care of the baby. The author then brings in his mom without the wife's consent, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The author felt overwhelmed and sought help from his mom, which is understandable. However, he didn't discuss this with his wife before making the decision. While the wife wasn't helping, the author's action of inviting his mom without her knowledge might have been a breach of trust or respect for their partnership.\n\nI need to consider if the author had other options. He tried asking his wife, but she wasn't cooperative. Maybe he could have sought counseling or another mediator. But given the situation of postpartum stress, it's possible he was desperate. Still, involving family without the spouse's consent can create more tension. The wife's reaction, while upset, might be a result of feeling disrespected. The author's mom's presence might also be causing additional stress, especially if the wife feels her partner didn't consult her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might have acted out of necessity but without proper communication. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong. Some might argue that he had a right to seek help, while others might say he should have found another way. Since the wife and mom have a good relationship, maybe there's a way to resolve this without conflict. However, the act of making a unilateral decision without considering the spouse's feelings could be seen as a mistake. So, the answer might hinge on the importance of mutual decision-making in partnerships.\n"
