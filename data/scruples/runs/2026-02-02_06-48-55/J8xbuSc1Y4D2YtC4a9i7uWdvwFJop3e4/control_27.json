Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. The story describes the situation where a woman enters the restaurant, is visibly dirty, coughs a lot, and the family demands she be removed. The restaurant complies and offers an apology and a free roll, but the couple still leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are the treatment of a homeless person, the right to service in a public place, and the customers' reaction. The restaurant is a public space, and by law, they should serve anyone unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman in question wasn't violent or disruptive initially; she was there, coughing, which the customers found distressing. However, the customers didn't approach her directly but instead told the staff to remove her. The staff did remove her, but the customers still left, possibly due to discomfort from the situation.\n\nThe question is whether their reaction was justified. On one hand, the customers might have been concerned about health risks, especially with the coughing and smell. On the other hand, they didn't give the woman the benefit of the doubt\u2014maybe her cough was due to something else, or her appearance was due to circumstances beyond her control. The fact that the restaurant allowed her to stay initially suggests they didn't see her as a problem, which could mean the customers were overreacting.\n\nAlso, the act of demanding her removal because of their discomfort might be seen as discriminatory. The couple's actions could be considered inconsiderate, as they prioritized their own comfort over the rights of another person. The fact that the restaurant complied might be due to the customers' insistence, which could put pressure on the staff to act against their own judgment if they didn't see a problem.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that the customers had the right to request removal if they felt the person was a health hazard. Public places can enforce their own rules regarding patrons' behavior, especially if someone is being disruptive or unsanitary. But in this case, it's unclear if the woman was violating any of the restaurant's rules. The staff didn't intervene until the customers asked, which might indicate that there wasn't an issue from the restaurant's perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the social responsibility aspect. Choosing to leave rather than confronting the situation or showing compassion might reflect poorly on the individuals involved. The couple's immediate reaction to demand removal rather than trying to understand or assist could be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nIn terms of the final decision, it's a balance between the rights of the customers and the rights of the homeless person. While the couple might not be breaking any laws by leaving, their actions could be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. The answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong because they prioritized their own discomfort over allowing the restaurant to handle the situation, and they left despite the staff already addressing the issue. The fact that they left after the problem was resolved might also indicate unnecessary escalation.\n"
