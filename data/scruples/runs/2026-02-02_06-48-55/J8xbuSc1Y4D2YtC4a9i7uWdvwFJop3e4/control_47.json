Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served there. Let me read through their story again and think through the details.\n\nThe person went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. Everything was going well until a woman walked in, sat next to them, and started coughing. She looked really dirty, and they assumed she was homeless. They told the staff to remove her or they'd leave, and the staff did. The author then felt grossed out, left the restaurant, and is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The restaurant is serving a homeless person, which is a positive thing in terms of inclusivity and social responsibility. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because of the woman's appearance and cough, which they perceived as a health risk. They demanded she be removed, and after that, they left. The question is whether their reaction was justified or if they're in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the restaurant is providing service to everyone, which is right. Homeless individuals should be treated with dignity and not discriminated against. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the stigma against homeless people and possibly violating the restaurant's policy of serving all customers regardless of background.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's appearance and cough might have made the author feel physically ill. However, making someone leave based on assumptions about their health (like TB) without evidence could be inappropriate. The staff did offer her water and didn't seem to have a problem with her presence, which is their responsibility. The customers' demand to remove her might be seen as bullying or rude, especially if there was no actual health hazard.\n\nAlso, the author's response was to confront the staff and leave after the woman was removed. That could be considered disrespectful to both the staff and the homeless woman. The free roll given by the chef indicates that the staff felt bad for the situation, which might suggest that the customers overstepped their bounds.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal choice. The author could have left on their own without confronting the staff. But instead, they demanded the removal of a customer, which could be seen as interfering with the restaurant's operations and the rights of another patron.\n\nAnother angle is the health concern. If someone is coughing, it's a legitimate worry, but unless they're visibly contagious (which TB isn't necessarily; it's spread through the air in close contact), it's not a valid reason to ask someone to leave. The staff might have a policy for handling health-related concerns, so the customers shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to demand her removal.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's important to consider how actions affect others. The author's actions might have contributed to the marginalization of homeless individuals by pressuring the restaurant to exclude someone who was just trying to eat. This could have a negative impact on the restaurant's willingness to serve homeless people in the future, which is a bigger issue.\n\nHowever, the author's discomfort and fear of germs or health risks are real, even if the reasoning is flawed. The challenge is balancing personal discomfort with respect for others' rights to be served in public places.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem to be inconsiderate of the homeless woman's rights and the restaurant's policies. Their decision to confront the staff and leave after the woman was removed could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
