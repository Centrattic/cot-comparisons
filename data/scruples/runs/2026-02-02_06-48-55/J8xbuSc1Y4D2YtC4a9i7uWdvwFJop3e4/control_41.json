Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote that story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman walked in, sat next to them, had a bad cough, was very dirty, and smelly. The user and their dad told the staff to remove her, which they did, and then the user left without eating the free roll. The question is whether they're the asshole (AITA) for leaving.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is asking if they were wrong to demand the woman's removal and then leave. Let me consider the different angles here.\n\nOn one hand, the woman was homeless, sick, and possibly a health risk. The user felt uncomfortable, even to the point of losing their appetite. They might have been concerned about hygiene and health risks. But on the other hand, people have to be allowed in public places. Restaurants can't just eject people just because they look homeless or are unwell unless they're violating rules. \n\nWait, but the restaurant did escort her out. So maybe the staff agreed with the customers' request. But is it ethical for customers to demand that someone be removed? That could be problematic. Homeless people are entitled to the same public services as anyone else, unless they're causing a disturbance or breaking the law. If the woman wasn't causing a problem beyond her appearance and coughing (which might be a symptom), then the customers might not have a right to ask her to leave. \n\nThe coughing could be a concern for health, but unless she was diagnosed with something contagious, it's not the customers' place to assume she's spreading disease. Restaurants are public places where people can be around others, even if they're sick. Also, the smell of body odor and rotting food is unpleasant, but that's part of human diversity. The user's reaction could be seen as discriminatory or classist.\n\nHowever, the user was a paying customer and might feel that their dining experience was ruined. They might be justified in leaving if they felt uncomfortable. But the act of demanding someone else be removed could be seen as inconsiderate and wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's policy. If the staff didn't mind her being there initially, then the customers might not have a valid reason to ask her to leave. It's possible the staff had their own reasons for not intervening, maybe they were trying to be inclusive or accommodate all customers. The user's action might have disrupted that.\n\nAlso, the user's reaction\u2014standing up and threatening to leave\u2014could be seen as aggressive. They might be prioritizing their own comfort over someone else's right to be in the restaurant. But they were also paying customers, so there's a balance there.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to ask someone to leave because they're homeless? Probably not. Homelessness is a social issue, and customers shouldn't be the ones enforcing who can or can't enter a public space. The restaurant should handle such situations according to their policies and local laws, which usually protect access for all people.\n\nBut the user might argue that they were protecting their health and the health of others. However, without medical evidence that the woman was contagious, that's an assumption. The cough could be from many non-contagious things. So the user's action might be based on fear or prejudice rather than fact.\n\nThe staff did apologize and offer a free roll, but the user left anyway. That shows they felt their demand wasn't enough to satisfy them. The staff's action might be a standard way to handle complaints, but the user wasn't satisfied, indicating they prioritized their own discomfort over the staff's attempt to resolve the situation.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the customer's right to request removal of another customer, the ethical implications of such a request, the right of homeless individuals to access public spaces, and the restaurant's role in managing such situations. The user's actions could be seen as discriminatory and inconsiderate, so they might be in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of personal discomfort and the right to leave a place if one isn't comfortable.\n"
