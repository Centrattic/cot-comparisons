Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a person and their dad going to a new restaurant, which ends up being crowded. They're at the sushi bar and things are going well until a homeless-looking woman enters, coughs a lot, and they get uncomfortable. The staff doesn't intervene, so they demand her removal and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different angles. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to ask for a homeless person to be removed from a restaurant. On one hand, the restaurant is a public space, and everyone should have access to it regardless of their circumstances. The woman might have been using the restaurant for shelter or basic needs. The customers' reaction based on appearance and health could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the staff didn't act initially, so the customers taking the initiative might be seen as helping, but maybe they should have handled it more discreetly.\n\nOn the other hand, the person felt physically ill due to the coughing and smell, which is understandable. They might have health concerns, especially if the cough suggests a contagious illness. The family's action could be viewed as prioritizing their well-being. However, the approach of confronting the staff publicly and demanding her removal might be seen as rude. It's possible that the staff wanted to avoid confrontation or maybe couldn't assist for other reasons. The free roll and apology from the chef might indicate the staff empathized but couldn't control the situation.\n\nThe key points are: the woman's right to be in the restaurant, the customers' health concerns, and the method of handling the situation. Discrimination against homeless people is a real issue, so the customers' reaction could be considered wrong. However, if the woman was indeed ill, there might be valid health and safety reasons. The story doesn't mention the staff's response or if the woman was a regular, which could affect the judgment.\n\nIn many places, restaurants can ask patrons to leave if they're causing a disturbance, but a homeless person sitting and being served isn't necessarily a disturbance. The customers' action might overstep their authority. The answer would depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. From a moral standpoint, judging someone by their appearance and health status can be seen as wrong. The person might be in the wrong for not considering the woman's situation and for publicly demanding her removal. Alternatively, if the environment was a health risk, their concern is valid. But since the staff didn't act, maybe the customers were trying to help. Still, the method is questionable. I think the author is in the wrong because they made a judgment based on appearance and didn't handle it more politely. So the answer is A."
