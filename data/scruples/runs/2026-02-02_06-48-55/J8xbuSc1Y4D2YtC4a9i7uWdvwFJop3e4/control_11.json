Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person goes to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place is packed, and they sit at the bar. Everything is good until a homeless-looking woman enters, sits next to them, and starts coughing. The author describes her as very dirty, coughing badly, and the smell is overwhelming. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The author and dad confront the staff, demand the woman be removed, and then leave. The staff apologizes, offers a free roll, but they don't stay.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. I need to decide based on the details given.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rights and responsibilities of both the customers and the restaurant. Restaurants are public places and can't discriminate against customers unless there's a valid reason. However, if a person is causing a disturbance, the restaurant has the right to ask them to leave. The woman in question was coughing and smelled bad, which might be due to illness or poor hygiene. The staff didn't act, so the customers did. But was that the right approach?\n\nThe author and dad demanded the woman's removal. The restaurant complied. But is that justifiable? The key here is whether the woman was actually a threat. If she was coughing due to an illness, she might be contagious. However, the author's reaction was based on perceived health risks. But is it ethical to treat someone differently because they're homeless or appear unclean? \n\nHomelessness is a complex issue, and people experiencing homelessness might not have access to regular hygiene facilities. The smell and appearance might not indicate poor personal habits but rather lack of resources. The staff's inaction could be due to policy or lack of awareness. The customers took matters into their own hands, which might be seen as overstepping. Restaurants are responsible for managing their own environment. As customers, demanding someone be removed isn't typically their right unless there's a clear safety issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author and dad were concerned for their health. If someone is coughing violently, especially in a food-related setting, it's understandable to feel uneasy. But the assumption that this person was a health risk might be unfounded. Also, the fact that they left immediately after the woman was escorted out suggests that their primary issue was with her presence, not the restaurant's handling of it. \n\nThe restaurant offered an apology and compensation, which might indicate they saw the situation as mishandled. The customers' decision to leave could be seen as a valid response to their discomfort, but it also raises questions about judgment based on appearance. There's a fine line between protecting oneself and discriminating against someone in need.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to consider empathy and social responsibility. The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory, even if their intent was to protect their health. However, from a personal standpoint, they might believe they had the right to avoid a perceived health risk. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the customers have the right to demand the woman's removal? Likely not, unless there was a clear violation of the restaurant's policies. The restaurant's responsibility is to manage such situations, not the customers. Therefore, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping. However, their intention was to protect their own health, which is a natural concern. \n\nBut ultimately, the decision to remove a patron is up to the restaurant's management. The customers didn't have the authority to make that demand. So, while the situation is uncomfortable and the restaurant's inaction might be questionable, the customers' direct action in demanding the woman's removal might be considered inappropriate. They should have addressed their concerns with the staff first and let the restaurant handle it. By taking that step themselves, they may be in the wrong, as it's a form of discrimination against someone based on their appearance and living situation.\n"
