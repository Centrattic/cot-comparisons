Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The author of the AITA post is the one who left the restaurant after a homeless woman was there. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the restaurant was packed, and the woman entered, sat near them, had a bad cough, was dirty, and didn't get much attention from the staff. The author and their dad demanded her removal, the staff complied, and then they left without eating the free roll. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between personal discomfort and compassion. The woman was homeless and possibly unwell, but the authors felt threatened by her presence. The restaurant is a public space, and serving homeless people is part of their inclusivity. However, the authors felt their health and comfort were compromised because of her coughing and smell.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is it acceptable to ask for someone's removal based on their appearance and health? 2) Did the restaurant do something wrong by serving her? 3) Should the authors have handled the situation differently?\n\nThe authors confronted the staff directly, leading to her removal. That action might be seen as inconsiderate, as the woman was a customer too. However, the authors were concerned about their health due to her cough, which could be perceived as a legitimate worry, though not everyone would agree. The smell might also be a factor, but again, the authors could have handled it more politely, like moving seats or asking for a transfer instead of demanding her removal.\n\nThe restaurant's response was to apologize and escort her out, which might indicate they felt some responsibility to their other customers. However, the staff didn't mention anything to the woman, only gave her water. That lack of action could be a problem for the restaurant's management in terms of hygiene or customer comfort policies.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people believe that everyone has the right to be served in public restaurants, regardless of their appearance or perceived health. Others might argue that businesses can set their own policies, and if the woman was disruptive, the staff could address that. But in this case, the staff didn't seem to intervene until the authors asked.\n\nThe authors' decision to leave might be seen as a justified reaction to their discomfort or fear of illness, but it's also a judgment call. The woman's rights and dignity should be considered. The authors didn't mention any actual aggression or direct threat from the woman, just their perception of her condition.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. If the authors acted out of prejudice or judgment without considering the woman's circumstances, they might be in the wrong. However, if they genuinely felt their health was at risk and the staff didn't act, their response could be seen as understandable, though not the most compassionate approach. The restaurant's lack of proactive measures might share some responsibility here. \n\nIn the AITA context, often the community looks for whether the person acted with empathy. Since the authors didn't mention trying to accommodate the woman (like moving) and instead demanded her removal immediately, that might tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. But others might empathize with their discomfort. The answer is probably A (the author is wrong) because they prioritized their own comfort over the woman's right to be served, and the restaurant didn't do anything to warrant their leaving.\n"
