Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a new restaurant, really liked the food, but when a homeless and very dirty woman with a bad cough came in, they told the staff to remove her or they would leave. The staff did remove her, and they left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Homeless people often face discrimination, and being asked to leave a restaurant might be part of that. But the woman was coughing a lot, which could be a health risk, especially in an enclosed space like a restaurant. The smell she had might also be a concern for other customers. The question is whether the restaurant should have served her or if the customers had the right to ask her to leave.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, restaurants can set their policies, but in many places, they can't discriminate based on appearance or homelessness unless there's a legitimate reason. If the woman was a threat to health or safety, maybe the restaurant had a right to ask her to leave. However, the customers demanding her removal might be overstepping. It's usually the staff's responsibility to handle such situations, not the customers. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. On one hand, everyone should have access to public spaces, including restaurants. On the other, if someone is visibly ill and poses a risk to others, there's a balance to strike. The customers' reaction might be seen as insensitive, but their discomfort and health concerns are real. The fact that the staff didn't act initially might have escalated the situation, leading the customers to take charge.\n\nThe answer could depend on whether the woman was a health risk. If she was coughing due to an illness, the restaurant might have a duty to protect other patrons. However, assuming she was a risk without medical confirmation could be prejudiced. The customers' actions might be seen as necessary if the restaurant failed to act, but generally, customers shouldn't dictate who can or can't be served unless there's a clear threat.\n\nAlso, the restaurant gave an apology and a free roll, which might indicate they agreed there was a problem. But the fact that they let the customers handle it raises questions about their policies. Overall, the customers might not be in the wrong if the situation was a legitimate health concern, but their approach could be seen as rude or discriminatory. It's a tough call, but maybe the answer leans towards A (they are in the wrong) because of the potential discrimination against the homeless woman, even if the circumstances were uncomfortable.\n"
