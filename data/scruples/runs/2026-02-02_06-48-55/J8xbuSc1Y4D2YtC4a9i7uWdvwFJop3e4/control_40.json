Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant after a homeless person was served there. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then, a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough came in, sat next to the author's dad, and the author was uncomfortable because of her appearance and cough. The restaurant didn't act immediately, so the author and dad told the staff they'd leave if the woman wasn't removed. The staff apologized, escorted her out, the author felt the smell, and they left without eating the free roll. The question is whether they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the restaurant is a public space, and everyone should be welcome regardless of their situation. The author is making a judgment based on appearance and health, which could be seen as discriminatory. The woman was a customer, and the author's reaction might be considered rude or inconsiderate towards her. Also, the author is implying that the restaurant should have removed her, which might not be their responsibility unless there's a health risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been genuinely concerned about the health risks, especially with the cough. The smell and appearance could have made them uncomfortable, and they paid for the meal, so their discomfort is valid. However, the way they confronted the staff\u2014threatening to leave\u2014could be seen as aggressive. Also, the restaurant did offer an apology and a free roll, which might not have been enough for the author.\n\nBut is the author wrong? The key points here are discrimination vs. personal comfort. Serving homeless people is a right, and the restaurant isn't at fault. The author's reaction might be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over someone else's right to eat. However, the situation's validity depends on cultural context and local norms. In some places, this might be a common reaction, but ethically, it's questionable. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the woman's circumstances and for pressuring the staff to remove her. The correct answer would likely be A (they are in the wrong) because the scenario involves discriminatory behavior towards a homeless person, which is frowned upon.\n"
