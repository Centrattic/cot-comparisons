Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were served a homeless person who was coughing and looked dirty. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant is a public place, and everyone has the right to be served there regardless of their appearance or socioeconomic status. The customer's reaction was based on the appearance and cough of the homeless woman, which might be a health concern, but maybe not a valid one. \n\nHowever, the decision to demand the woman be removed could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant's staff didn't act on their initial request, but when the customer threatened to leave, they complied. That shows the customers had some leverage. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was a real health hazard, like visible illness or unsanitary conditions, the customer might have a point. But in this case, the woman was just coughing and looked dirty. The smell and cough might not be the woman's fault; homelessness can lead to limited access to hygiene facilities. \n\nAlso, the customer's reaction was to leave immediately after the woman was asked to leave. The sushi chef offered a free roll, but they didn't eat it. The action of leaving might be justified if they felt uncomfortable, but it's also a judgment call. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The customers might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort, but they could be criticized for not showing compassion or considering the woman's circumstances. Restaurants often have policies about health and safety, so if the staff didn't see it as a problem, maybe the customers overreacted. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's important to treat all people with dignity. The customers' actions could be seen as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless individuals. However, their discomfort is also understandable, especially if they felt a health risk. \n\nI think the key points are the customers' demand to remove the woman, which might be discriminatory, and the restaurant's response. Since the staff initially didn't act but complied under pressure, it shows the customers had influence. The answer might lean towards the customers being in the wrong for using their privilege to remove someone else from a public space based on appearance and health concerns that might not be legitimate. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they demanded the removal of a customer from a public establishment based on prejudiced reactions rather than legitimate health violations.\n"
