Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person with a bad cough. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to a new restaurant with their dad. They liked the food and the sushi chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman came in, looked very dirty, had a bad cough, and the smell was overwhelming. The author and dad demanded she be removed, which she was. They left after that and didn't eat the free roll given. The question is if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should be accessible to everyone. The woman might be a customer there to eat, regardless of her appearance. The staff didn't kick her out initially, so maybe the author felt uncomfortable and reacted. But then, is it right to demand someone be removed just based on appearance and coughing?\n\nThe cough could be a health concern, but the staff didn't act on it first. Maybe the staff had a reason to not remove her. Also, the smell and appearance might be due to being homeless, which is a social issue. The author's reaction is understandable from a personal discomfort angle, but it could also be seen as discriminatory or inconsiderate. They assumed the worst about her health based on her appearance and coughing. Also, the restaurant might have policies against such actions, so by demanding removal, the author might have overstepped.\n\nBut then again, if someone is visibly very ill and the staff isn't doing anything, maybe the author is justified in protecting their own health and comfort. However, that's a line\u2014assuming someone is a health risk without evidence. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, unless there's a clear health code violation. The author's actions could be seen as infringing on the rights of another customer.\n\nSo it's a bit of a gray area. Depending on perspective, some might say the author was within their rights to leave if they felt unsafe, but others would argue that they shouldn't have demanded the woman be removed. The fact that they left after the woman was escorted out complicates things. The restaurant gave a free roll, so maybe they handled it. But the act of demanding removal could be seen as the problem.\n\nI think the answer would be A (wrong) because demanding someone be removed based on their appearance and health without evidence is discriminatory. However, their discomfort is real, but the right action would have been to leave without demanding her removal. The actual act of leaving is their choice, but the way they tried to have her removed might be the issue. So the author is in the wrong for demanding her removal, hence answer A.\n"
