Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless woman walked in, sat next to them, and started coughing a lot. She looked very dirty and had a bad smell. The user and their dad told the restaurant staff to remove her, which they did. The user then left without eating the free roll they were given.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions taken. The user confronted the staff about the homeless woman, leading to her being escorted out. Then they left the restaurant. The main question is whether this was justified or if they were in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the woman was homeless, visibly unwell, and the user felt uncomfortable and concerned about health. They might have felt that the restaurant wasn't maintaining hygiene standards, especially since she was coughing and smelled bad. However, the user didn't ask for her to leave politely first; they directly demanded her removal, which could be seen as rude or discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to be served in a restaurant unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman wasn't causing any direct harm; she was just sitting there. The user's reaction might be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over someone in need. Also, the restaurant staff didn't initially remove her, which suggests they might have been trying to accommodate her. The user's insistence to leave could be perceived as insensitive, especially if the woman was in a vulnerable situation.\n\nAnother angle is the health concern. The user mentions the cough and smell, which might make them worry about health risks. However, unless the woman was actively making others sick or violating health codes, it's up to the restaurant to manage that. The user's immediate reaction without giving the staff a chance to handle it themselves could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the user left the restaurant without eating, which might be seen as a judgmental reaction. The sushi chef apologized and offered a free food item, but the user still left, implying that their satisfaction wasn't the main issue\u2014it was the presence of the homeless woman. This could indicate that they valued their own comfort over the restaurant's efforts to handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the user's actions might be considered discriminatory against homeless individuals. It's important to consider the broader implications of their behavior. While they had the right to leave if they felt uncomfortable, demanding someone to leave based on their appearance and health could be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal boundaries and health concerns. If the user genuinely felt that their health was at risk, they might have a different perspective. But given the situation, the woman wasn't causing a direct threat, so the user's actions might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOverall, I think the user is in the wrong because they prioritized their own discomfort over the rights of a vulnerable individual. They could have left the restaurant without confronting the staff or demanding the woman's removal. Their actions might have contributed to stigmatizing the homeless and expecting the restaurant to exclude someone in need. So, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
