Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves leaving a restaurant after a homeless woman was served there. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because the woman was coughing, looked dirty, and smelled bad. They confronted the staff, leading to her removal, then left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant was serving a homeless person, which the author took issue with. The main arguments here are about personal hygiene and the right to public accommodations. In the U.S., businesses can't discriminate based on factors like disability or homelessness under the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, if the person's presence is a direct threat to health or safety, that might be a different situation. \n\nThe woman had a severe cough, which could indicate a contagious illness. If she was coughing, maybe there's a health concern. But the staff didn't mention any health issues, just gave her water. The author's reaction was based on appearance and smell, which are subjective. It's possible the woman was homeless and ill but not a direct threat. \n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author and their dad demanded she be removed. That could be seen as discriminatory if the restaurant wasn't violating any health codes. The fact that the staff apologized and removed her suggests they might have felt uncomfortable too, but maybe they had other reasons. \n\nLeaving after being offered a free roll might be seen as a minor issue, but the bigger question is whether they had the right to demand her removal based on appearance. The author's decision could be viewed as discriminatory, assuming the woman wasn't violating any rules. \n\nAlso, the restaurant's location in a sketchy area might imply that they serve a diverse clientele, including homeless people. The author might have made a judgment based on their own discomfort, which isn't a valid reason under anti-discrimination laws. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were based on the appearance and smell of the woman, not on any actual violation of the restaurant's policies. The confrontation and demand for her removal could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
