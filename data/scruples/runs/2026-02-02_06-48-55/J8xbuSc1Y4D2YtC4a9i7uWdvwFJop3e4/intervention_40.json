Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they left a restaurant because a homeless woman was being served there. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. The food was great, but then a homeless woman came in, looked dirty, coughed a lot, and the smell was bad. The restaurant didn't seem to do much except give her water. The person and their dad demanded she be removed, then left when she was escorted out. The sushi chef apologized and gave a free roll, but they still left.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. \n\nOn one hand, the customer's discomfort is understandable. A person who looks unclean and is coughing can be off-putting, especially in a restaurant where hygiene is important. The smell and appearance might make someone uneasy. Also, if the restaurant didn't take action, the customers might feel they have to intervene, thinking it's a health risk or a bad experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was a customer, so the restaurant has a responsibility to serve everyone. Homeless individuals have the right to be served unless they're causing a disturbance. The customers didn't wait for the restaurant to handle the situation themselves. They immediately demanded she be removed, which could be seen as discriminatory. Also, leaving after being served a free roll might be seen as a way to avoid further interaction rather than giving the restaurant a chance to resolve the issue.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the customers have the right to demand she be removed? Was her presence a health hazard? The woman was coughing, which could be a concern, but is that enough to ask her to leave? Restaurants often have policies for such situations. The customers might have overstepped by not allowing the staff to handle it. Plus, the way they left without eating the free food could be seen as impolite or unfair.\n\nAnother angle: The woman was there legally and had the right to be served. The customers' reaction might be based on prejudice against homeless people. They might have made assumptions about her health and cleanliness without knowing her situation. The restaurant's staff perhaps didn't act quickly enough, but the customers shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to remove her unless there was a direct threat.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the customers could have asked the staff to address the situation more politely instead of demanding her removal. Their immediate reaction might have been impulsive and not considering the woman's rights. Also, the fact that they left after being offered a free roll suggests they were more concerned about their own discomfort than the restaurant's efforts to compensate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the customers' actions could be seen as inappropriate. They didn't give the restaurant enough time to handle the situation, and their demand to remove the woman might have been based on bias. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
