Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman who was coughing and looked very unclean. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, which she was, and then they left without eating the free food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant is a public place and should serve everyone, including homeless individuals. However, the woman's appearance and cough might have posed a health concern, which is a valid concern in a food establishment. The author's reaction is based on fear of illness, which is understandable but could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant did nothing to address the situation initially, even though the woman was there. The staff just gave her water. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable and made their request. The restaurant complied, which suggests that the staff might have agreed there was an issue. However, the act of demanding someone else be removed from a public space can be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the person is homeless and in need of assistance.\n\nAlso, the author is a customer, so they have the right to request removal if they feel their health is at risk. But is that a valid reason? Health risks are real, but the restaurant should handle such situations according to health codes. If the woman was actually a health risk, the restaurant should have taken action earlier. The fact that they didn't might mean the author had a valid reason to voice their concern.\n\nHowever, the author's behavior\u2014standing up and demanding removal\u2014might come off as confrontational. It's possible the staff was handling the situation in their own way, and the customers didn't need to escalate it. The author could have asked for a table change instead of confronting the staff. \n\nIn terms of discrimination, treating someone differently because they are homeless is an issue. But the author's primary concern was health and safety, which is a different angle. The smell and coughing might be legitimate triggers for leaving, especially if the restaurant didn't address it adequately.\n\nThe free roll and apology from the chef suggest the restaurant felt bad about the situation, but the customers' actions led to the woman being asked to leave. That might be seen as the real problem here\u2014using their status as paying customers to remove someone else from the premises. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had concerns, but their method of addressing it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how public spaces are managed. However, since the woman was a customer, the author's demand to remove her could be viewed as unethical. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they used their privilege as customers to eject another patron based on her appearance and health, which might be discriminatory.\n"
