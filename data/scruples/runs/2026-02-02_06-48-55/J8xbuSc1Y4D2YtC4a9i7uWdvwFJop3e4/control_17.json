Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their dad went to a new restaurant with good reviews, even though it's in a sketchy area. The place was packed, they ordered sushi, and things were going well. Then a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, started coughing a lot, looked very dirty, and had a bad smell. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The author and dad demanded she be removed, she was, they got a free roll, but left anyway. Now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether asking the restaurant to remove a homeless person makes them an asshole. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant might have a policy of serving everyone. The author might feel uncomfortable due to the health concerns from her cough and smell. On the other hand, the woman is homeless and possibly in need of services, and the author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory or lacking empathy.\n\nThe restaurant's response is also important. They apologized and removed the woman, which suggests they might have had their own policies. But why didn't they remove her earlier? Maybe they were trying to be inclusive, but the author felt it was a health risk. However, restaurants can't just kick out customers without cause. If the woman was a health hazard, maybe there's a protocol to follow, but demanding her removal might not be the customer's place to decide.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author's actions were based on their comfort and health concerns, but they might have been inconsiderate. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, but they also need to maintain a safe environment. The fact that the author left after being given a free roll might indicate they felt their request wasn't adequately addressed, but maybe the restaurant had already taken action.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing emphasis on compassion for the homeless. However, personal boundaries and health concerns are also valid. The line here is between being reasonable and being discriminatory. The author's reaction could be seen as a reaction to a perceived threat, but it's possible they overstepped by demanding removal without giving the staff a chance to handle it themselves.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the woman wasn't a threat. The author's judgment is based on appearance and symptoms, which might be inaccurate. The restaurant might have been doing their best, and the authors' response was harsh. On the flip side, if the woman was indeed ill, the restaurant might have protocols to handle such cases without customer intervention.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions could be viewed as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman and possibly overstepping their role as a customer. Therefore, the answer might be A, that they are in the wrong. However, if the restaurant didn't take action and the authors felt it was necessary to protect their health, maybe B is the case. But generally, customers don't have the authority to demand removal of other customers unless there's a violation of rules. So the authors might have been in the wrong.\n"
