Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they served a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman who came into the restaurant, was sick and dirty, and the author and their dad demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, and they left without eating the free food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to ask a business to remove a customer for being homeless. Restaurants are public spaces and should serve everyone, regardless of their circumstances. However, there's also a public health aspect. The woman was coughing severely, which could be a concern for others. But the author's reaction might be based on fear or discomfort rather than a genuine health risk.\n\nThe author mentions the woman's appearance and smell as reasons for leaving. While that's their personal experience, it raises questions about discrimination. Homelessness itself isn't a reason to exclude someone, but if someone is a health hazard, maybe there's a different approach. However, the author didn't report any actual health violation; they just assumed the cough meant something serious like TB. \n\nThe restaurant didn't act initially, which could indicate that the woman wasn't a direct threat. The staff eventually removed her when asked, but it's unclear if they had a valid reason. The author's demand to remove her might infringe on her right to be served, unless there's a legitimate health code violation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt uncomfortable and lost their appetite. It's their right to leave a public place if they're not comfortable. But the act of demanding someone else to be removed could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, balancing the right to equal service against personal discomfort. The author might be in the wrong for pressuring the restaurant to remove a customer based on appearance and assumptions. However, if there's a valid health concern, maybe there's a middle ground. But since the author couldn't confirm the health risk, their action was based on prejudice. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong).\n"
