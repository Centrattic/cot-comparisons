Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. I need to figure out if the author's actions were justified or not.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their dad went to a new sushi restaurant. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then, a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough came in and sat next to them. She was very dirty and had a strong smell. The author and their dad demanded that the restaurant remove her, which they did. The author then left without eating the free roll.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to ask for her removal and leave. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should serve everyone. Turning away or removing a customer without a valid reason could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant didn't act immediately, so maybe they didn't consider her presence a problem. The author's reaction might be based on appearance and smell, which could be prejudicial. Also, the woman's cough could be due to illness, but that's not a reason to ask her to leave unless she's a health risk. However, the author's discomfort leading them to leave is their choice, but demanding her removal might not be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt uncomfortable and threatened, especially with the smell and cough. The restaurant did eventually remove her, which might indicate they agreed there was an issue. The author's decision to leave could be seen as their right if they felt the environment was unpleasant. But the key point is whether the author had the right to demand her removal, not just leave. The restaurant might have policies about health and safety, and if they didn't act, the customers shouldn't dictate who gets served.\n\nAlso, the author's description of the woman as \"dirty\" and \"smelling like body odor and rotting food\" might be a form of stereotyping. Homelessness is a social issue, and treating people with dignity is important. But the restaurant's responsibility is to provide service to all, unless there's a violation of health codes or disruptive behavior. The woman wasn't violent or causing a scene beyond coughing. The staff brought her water but didn't act until the author intervened.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, customers can express discomfort, but demanding someone else to leave is another matter. Restaurants can ask customers to leave if they're disruptive, but the author isn't the restaurant staff. So the author's demand might have overstepped, assuming the staff didn't see her as a problem. However, the restaurant did comply, so maybe there was an unspoken issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the restaurant didn't act first, the author taking action could be seen as intervening to protect their own comfort, but it's possible that they were being judgmental. Alternatively, if the woman was a health risk, maybe the author had a point. But TB is contagious, and if her cough was that severe, maybe the restaurant should have been more proactive. However, the author didn't report her for health reasons but based on appearance and smell.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for demanding her removal based on her appearance and for leaving because of that, as it could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant's response to remove her after the author's request might indicate that they had policies in place that the author wasn't aware of, but the act of demanding someone else to leave is generally not acceptable unless there's a clear violation of the restaurant's rules. The author's actions could be considered rude and prejudiced against the homeless person.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
