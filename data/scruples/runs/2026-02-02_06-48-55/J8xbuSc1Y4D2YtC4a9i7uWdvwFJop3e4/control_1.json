Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author went to a new restaurant with their dad, which was in a sketchy area but had great reviews. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless woman walked in. She was very dirty, had a terrible cough, and the smell was overwhelming. The restaurant staff didn't say anything except bring her water. The author and dad told the staff to remove her, and when they did, the family left without eating their free roll.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. Homeless people have the right to enter public places, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. The staff didn't seem to be doing anything about her presence. The author felt uncomfortable due to her appearance and health, which is understandable, but confronting the staff and demanding her removal might be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the woman's cough and smell could pose health or safety concerns, but that's more up to the restaurant's discretion. The staff didn't act on it, so maybe the author thought they had to step in. But in reality, it's not the customers' role to remove someone from a restaurant. They should probably ask the staff to handle it. If the staff didn't address it, the customers could leave without demanding the person's removal. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as disrespectful to the homeless person. Forcing a restaurant to remove someone based on appearance could be considered discriminatory. Also, the author was aware of the woman's homelessness, which adds a layer of social responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about their own comfort and health. But the line here is whether it's appropriate to demand someone's removal. The restaurant didn't find her presence a problem, so the author's intervention might be seen as overstepping. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, customers shouldn't demand the removal of others unless there's a direct threat. The author's approach was confrontational. They could have left without making the staff escort her out. By demanding her removal, they're taking it upon themselves to enforce something that's not their place to decide. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they made a judgment based on the woman's appearance and forced the staff to act, which is not appropriate. They should have either asked the staff to handle it politely or left without confrontation.\n"
