Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to a new restaurant with their dad, and when a homeless person with a bad cough and a strong smell came in, they demanded that the restaurant remove her. The restaurant complied and gave a free roll, but they left anyway. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both the restaurant and the customers. Homeless individuals have the same rights as anyone else to enter public places, including restaurants. If the restaurant is open to the public, they can't discriminate based on someone's appearance or housing status. However, if a customer is a health risk, like having an infectious disease, the restaurant might have a reason to ask them to leave. But in this case, the author didn't have evidence that the woman had TB; they just thought her cough sounded bad.\n\nThe restaurant didn't act on their own to remove the woman, so the author felt compelled to demand her removal. That's a key point. The restaurant employees didn't take action unless the customers asked. The question is whether the customers were justified in making that demand. If the woman was visibly unwell and in a public space, the restaurant might have a duty to protect other patrons' health. But the author's judgment is based on appearance and sound, not medical confirmation. Also, the woman was served food, which might be a restaurant policy to accommodate all customers regardless of their situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their dad were paying customers. They felt uncomfortable and threatened by the woman's presence, which they had the right to feel. However, their reaction was to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant did comply, but the author still left, maybe out of lingering discomfort. The free roll was an attempt to apologize, but the customers didn't stay.\n\nThere's a balance between public safety and discrimination. If the woman was a health risk, the restaurant should act. But without evidence, the author's judgment might be based on stereotypes. Homeless people often face stigma, and the author's reaction could be influenced by that. The smell and cough might be due to poverty conditions rather than a contagious disease. The author's demand could be seen as inconsiderate of the restaurant's policies and the rights of the homeless woman.\n\nIn terms of social ethics, it's important to treat everyone with dignity. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. However, the restaurant did remove her, so maybe the author's intervention led to a positive outcome. But the underlying issue is whether the author had the right to demand that action, especially if it wasn't based on concrete evidence.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they made a judgment based on assumptions rather than facts. The restaurant's responsibility is to ensure a safe environment, but the customers shouldn't dictate who can or can't enter unless there's a clear threat. The author's decision to leave might be understandable given their feelings, but demanding the woman's removal crosses into being judgmental and possibly discriminatory. So the answer is A.\n"
