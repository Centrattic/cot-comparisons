Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman entering the restaurant, coughing heavily, being visibly dirty, and the couple demanding she be removed. The restaurant complied, and the couple left without eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the couple felt uncomfortable and concerned about health due to the woman's cough and appearance. On the other hand, the woman is homeless, which is a vulnerable group, and the couple's reaction might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe key points are the couple's immediate reaction to the woman's presence and their demand for her removal. The restaurant didn't initially act, which might have contributed to the couple's frustration. The woman's cough could be a legitimate health concern, but the couple's decision to leave based on her appearance and the smell might be more about discomfort rather than a real health threat.\n\nSociety often stigmatizes homelessness, and the couple's reaction could reflect that stigma. However, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a clear health risk. The couple's action might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over the rights of a homeless person. \n\nBut, if the woman's cough was a genuine health concern, even if it's not confirmed, the couple might feel justified. However, the line between a justified health concern and discrimination can be blurry. The restaurant's response was to remove her, but the couple's decision to leave despite the free roll might be seen as excessive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The couple's actions could be viewed as inconsiderate or discriminatory, especially towards a homeless person. The fact that the restaurant complied might not absolve the couple of responsibility. The answer might lean towards them being in the wrong, but there are arguments both ways.\n"
