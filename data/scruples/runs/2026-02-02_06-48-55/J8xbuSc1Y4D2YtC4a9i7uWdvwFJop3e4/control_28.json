Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a person who went to a new restaurant with their dad, found the place packed, and then a homeless woman entered. The woman was coughing and looked very dirty. The restaurant didn't do anything, so the person and their dad demanded she be removed. The staff complied, but they left without eating the free roll. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The woman is homeless, which is a social issue. The restaurant allowed her in, which is their right to serve anyone. The people in the story felt uncomfortable and demanded her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, they were concerned about health risks due to her cough and smell, which might be a legitimate health and safety concern.\n\nBut wait, the restaurant didn't take any action initially. Maybe they were following their own policies, or perhaps they couldn't evict her without a valid reason. The patrons took it upon themselves to ask for her removal, which could be seen as rude or elitist. However, if the person was indeed ill and posing a health risk, maybe there's a justification. But the line between health concerns and prejudice can be thin here.\n\nThe writer's actions might be viewed as inconsiderate. They judged the woman based on appearance and made others uncomfortable. On the flip side, their reaction could be a genuine fear of illness. However, the restaurant management is usually responsible for handling such situations, not individual customers. By confronting the staff directly and demanding her removal, the author and their dad might have overstepped their role as customers.\n\nAlso, the fact that they left without finishing their meal and didn't take the free roll might indicate that their discomfort was significant. But the key issue is whether they had the right to demand someone else's removal. In most places, customers can't ask other customers to leave; that's the staff's responsibility. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking that action.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the woman was a threat to health and safety, the staff should have acted. But the patrons shouldn't have made that decision themselves. The staff's inaction could be problematic too. But the question is about the author's actions. If they felt that the staff wasn't handling it, maybe they should have asked the staff to address the situation rather than demanding removal themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong if they were genuinely concerned about health, but their method of handling it was inappropriate. However, since the restaurant didn't take action, maybe the author shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands. The answer might lean towards A (they are wrong) because they didn't let the staff handle it and made a judgment based on appearance.\n"
