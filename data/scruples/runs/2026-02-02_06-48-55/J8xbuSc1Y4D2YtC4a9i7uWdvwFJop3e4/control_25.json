Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The person and their dad went to a new sushi place, which was packed. They were at the bar, enjoying the food, when a homeless woman came in, looked very dirty, coughed a lot, and had a bad smell. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The person and their dad demanded she be removed, which she was. They left, didn't eat the free roll, and are now wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the restaurant has a responsibility to provide a safe and hygienic environment for all customers. If the woman was visibly ill and had a strong odor, it could be a health risk. Restaurants do have policies about health and safety. But on the other hand, the woman is homeless and might not have access to regular hygiene facilities. The act of demanding her removal could be seen as discriminatory or lacking empathy.\n\nHowever, the person and their dad didn't confront her directly but asked the restaurant to remove her. The staff did remove her after the request. The person felt that their health and comfort were at risk, which is a valid concern. But is that a justification for their actions? It's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility. If the restaurant allowed her in, they might have a responsibility to handle such situations, perhaps by offering services or cleaning facilities, rather than just leaving her there.\n\nAnother angle: the person's reaction might be based on fear or prejudice. The description of her as \"dirty\" and the comparison to TB might be influenced by stereotypes about homeless people. The person might be overreacting, but the smell and coughing could be genuine health issues. The restaurant's lack of action until the customers intervened raises questions about their own policies. Maybe the staff didn't know how to handle it or were under-resourced.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, customers have the right to expect a clean environment. If someone is a health risk, the restaurant should address it. But the way the customers handled it\u2014demanding removal\u2014could be seen as impolite. However, given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether their actions were reasonable or if they were discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the fact that they left and didn't eat the free roll shows they were upset, but the restaurant did apologize and offer compensation. So the restaurant might have realized it was a bad situation.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The customers might not be entirely in the wrong because they were concerned about health, but their approach might have been abrupt. Alternatively, they could be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. The answer hinges on whether the health risk was real or perceived and how the restaurant handled it. Since the staff eventually removed her, maybe the customers' demand was justified, but their immediate reaction might have been too harsh. However, given the context, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the health concerns were valid, but it's a grey area.\n"
