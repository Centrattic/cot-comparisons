Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, they sat at the sushi bar, and everything was going well. Then a homeless woman came in and sat next to them. She had a terrible cough and was very dirty. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The user and their dad told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff apologizes, takes her out, and they leave, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The woman was homeless, very ill-looking, and smelly. The staff didn't act initially. The customers demanded her removal, leading to her being escorted out. The customers left, feeling unappetite.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the restaurant has a responsibility to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for all patrons. However, serving homeless individuals isn't inherently wrong. The woman was a customer, and unless she was violating health codes or causing a disturbance, the staff might have been within their rights to let her stay. The customers might have overstepped by demanding her removal based on her appearance and health, which could be seen as discriminatory. Homelessness and illness don't necessarily mean she posed a health risk, and the customers' reaction could be seen as prejudiced. However, the smell and cough might have caused discomfort, but that's subjective. The restaurant's failure to address the situation could indicate they weren't enforcing their policies, but the customers' direct confrontation might be justified if they felt their hygiene was at risk. It's a tricky balance between customer rights and social responsibility. The staff's apology and offering a free roll suggest they recognized some fault, but maybe not the customer's part. Legally, the customers might not be in the wrong, but socially, there's a case that they were being insensitive. So, the answer could be A or B depending on perspective. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the action was based on personal discomfort rather than a clear violation of restaurant policy, the author might be in the wrong (A). But if the restaurant didn't act, the customers had the right to leave. Need to weigh health concerns versus discrimination. The user's reaction might be seen as discriminatory. So, answer A.\n"
