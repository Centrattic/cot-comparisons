Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant after they served a homeless person. The situation involves a person who was very visibly unclean and had a severe cough, which made the author and their dad uncomfortable. They asked the staff to remove the person and left when they did.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. The restaurant is a public space, and the staff has a responsibility to serve all customers unless someone is being disruptive or violating health codes. The homeless woman in question didn't seem to be causing a disturbance beyond her appearance and coughing. The staff didn't ask her to leave initially, which suggests they didn't see a problem. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be discomfort due to the woman's appearance and the cough, which they perceived as a threat. However, making the staff remove a customer based on personal discomfort could be seen as rude or discriminatory. Homelessness is a social issue, and people from all walks of life can end up in such situations. The author's reaction might stem from fear or prejudice, which isn't acceptable unless there's a genuine health and safety concern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the woman was indeed very ill (like TB as the author thought), that's a health issue. But the staff didn't act on that, so maybe the author overestimated the risk. The smell and the cough didn't immediately endanger others unless there was a clear health violation. The author's decision to leave was their right, but demanding the person's removal might cross a line.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving, but pressuring the staff to remove a customer based on appearance and perceived illness without evidence could be seen as being inconsiderate. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because their actions were based on personal discomfort rather than a real threat, and it's discriminatory. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if considering personal autonomy and discomfort as valid reasons to leave. The line here is thin, but in ethical terms, serving all customers is a business's duty unless there's a violation of rules. So, the author's demand to remove the woman is likely inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory, making A the correct answer.\n"
