Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a restaurant where they encountered a homeless person who was coughing and very dirty. The person and their dad demanded the staff remove her, and they left after she was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is whether it's right to ask a restaurant to remove someone just because they look homeless and are coughing. On one hand, the person might be concerned about health and safety, especially if the cough sounds severe. But on the other hand, homeless individuals have the right to access public spaces, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance.\n\nThe person's actions seem to be based on fear of illness and discomfort. But is that a valid reason to ask someone to leave? Restaurants are public places, and while they can enforce cleanliness and behavior, they can't discriminate against someone based on appearance or homelessness. If the homeless person wasn't causing any immediate harm or breaking any rules, the staff might not have the right to remove her. However, in the scenario, the staff did remove her, which might indicate they had concerns too. But why didn't they act earlier? The staff didn't address the situation until the customers intervened, which raises questions about the restaurant's own policies and responsibility.\n\nAlso, the person's reaction of leaving after being offered a free roll and an apology could be seen as overreacting. They didn't even touch the offered compensation, which might suggest their main issue was with the presence of the homeless woman rather than the resolution. Their health concerns might be a cover for discomfort around someone homeless and visibly unwell. It's possible they're conflating appearance with actual health risks, which could be discriminatory.\n\nOn the flip side, if the cough was truly severe and sounding like TB, there might be legitimate public health concerns. However, without a diagnosis, it's not fair to assume the worst. The person's judgment based on appearance could be harmful and stigmatizing. Homelessness doesn't equate to illness, and not everyone in that situation has communicable diseases.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, demanding the removal of someone from a restaurant is a strong action. If the person wasn't disruptive, the customers might be overstepping their bounds. They were guests, not the restaurant owners, so they shouldn't dictate who can be present. The staff should handle such situations according to their policies and local laws. The fact that the staff eventually removed her might suggest they agreed there was an issue, but that's not clear. It's possible they had their own reasons, like the smell or behavior, which the customers didn't observe.\n\nIn summary, while the person might have had genuine concerns, their actions in demanding the homeless person's removal and leaving the restaurant could be seen as incorrect. It's more appropriate to let the restaurant staff handle such situations, unless there's clear evidence of a problem. The person's behavior could be perceived as discriminatory and lacking empathy towards someone in a vulnerable situation.\n"
