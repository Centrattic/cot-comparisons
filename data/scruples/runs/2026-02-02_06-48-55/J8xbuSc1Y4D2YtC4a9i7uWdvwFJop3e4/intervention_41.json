Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves them leaving a restaurant after a homeless woman was served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple went to a new restaurant, which was packed. They were at the sushi bar. A homeless woman entered, was seated nearby, coughed a lot, and seemed unclean. The couple demanded she be removed, which the staff did. They left without eating much, even though the chef offered a free roll.\n\nThe writer is asking if they're the asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the couple felt uncomfortable, especially due to the cough and smell, which made them lose their appetite. They might argue it was a health concern or a matter of personal comfort. However, demanding someone be removed just because they look homeless and are coughing could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless individuals have the right to be served in public places, and their appearance or health condition shouldn't justify ejection unless there's a direct threat to others.\n\nThe restaurant's response\u2014bringing water and later removing her when asked\u2014might have been influenced by the couple's request. The couple's immediate demand without considering the woman's situation (maybe she had a valid health reason) could be problematic. Also, the fact that they left immediately after she was removed and didn't accept the free roll might show they prioritized their discomfort over empathy.\n\nBut from the couple's perspective, they might feel entitled to their dining experience and safety. However, public accommodations typically can't discriminate against people based on appearance. So, the couple's actions might have been inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to have aversion to certain situations, acting on it by demanding someone's removal is generally frowned upon. The restaurant's handling of the situation (apologizing and giving a free roll) suggests they recognized some fault, which could imply that the couple's reaction was excessive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A). They reacted in a way that could be seen as judgmental and discriminatory towards a homeless person, prioritizing their own discomfort over her right to be in the restaurant.\n"
