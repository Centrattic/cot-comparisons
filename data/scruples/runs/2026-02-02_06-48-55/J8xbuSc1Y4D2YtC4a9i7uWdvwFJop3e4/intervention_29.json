Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. Everything was going well until a homeless woman entered. She was dirty, coughing, and had a bad smell. The person and their dad told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff apologized, took her out, gave them a free roll, but they still left.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the person's actions and the context. They were disturbed by the woman's appearance and coughing. They felt uncomfortable and unappetizing. But did they handle it the right way? The restaurant didn't ask her to leave initially; the staff just brought her water. The customers demanded her removal, which the staff then did. The person left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the restaurant, they might have a policy about handling such situations. If the woman was a regular customer or if the restaurant serves a diverse community, they might not want to be seen as discriminatory. However, if the woman was disruptive or had a contagious illness, the restaurant might have a responsibility to protect other patrons' health and safety.\n\nThe person's main concern was their own comfort and health. They might argue that the coughing could be contagious and the smell was too overwhelming. On the other hand, the woman might have had legitimate reasons for her condition, and the restaurant's staff should have addressed it without customer intervention. The question is whether the customers overstepped by demanding her removal, even if the staff eventually complied.\n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and treating people with dignity is important. The woman might have been there for a meal, perhaps the only one she gets. The person's actions could be seen as prejudiced, prioritizing their discomfort over another person's need for food. However, in a public place, there's a balance between public health and social responsibility.\n\nIn terms of whether the person is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the woman posed a health risk, the restaurant should address it. But if the person's reaction was based on appearance and not on actual health concerns, then they might be acting on bias. The fact that they left after the situation was resolved might show they weren't malicious, but the initial demand to remove her could be seen as inappropriate unless there was a clear threat.\n"
