Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because a homeless person was being served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The scenario involves a homeless person with symptoms of illness (a severe cough) and poor hygiene. The diners felt uncomfortable and decided to ask the restaurant to remove her, leading to them leaving.\n\nHomelessness and health issues are complex social issues. The couple's concern might stem from health and safety worries, especially given the cough, which could be contagious. However, it's important to note that not everyone with a cough has a serious illness like TB, and assuming that might be a stereotype.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is a public place, and the staff has a responsibility to ensure the well-being of all patrons and guests. If the homeless individual was indeed a health risk, the restaurant should have taken appropriate measures. However, the couple didn't ask for her to be removed due to specific health code violations, but rather because of their discomfort. That could be seen as discriminatory or classist.\n\nThe response of the restaurant is also a factor. If they removed her without proper cause, that might be problematic. But if they did it for health reasons, maybe it was justified. However, the user's main question is about the diners' actions. They felt entitled to make that request based on their comfort, which might not be the restaurant's responsibility to accommodate in that way.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between individual rights and social responsibility. The couple had the right to leave if they felt uncomfortable, but demanding the removal might cross into being inconsiderate. The homeless person's right to access public services versus the other patrons' right to a comfortable environment. However, in many places, businesses can ask someone to leave if they're causing a disturbance or health risk, but the bar for that is usually higher than just causing discomfort to some customers.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for judgment and empathy. The couple might not have considered the homeless woman's circumstances, making their actions seem harsh. They might be perceived as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless individuals, which is a societal issue. However, they might genuinely fear illness, especially if they have family members with compromised immune systems.\n\nIn terms of restaurant policy, it's unclear if they had a valid reason to remove her. If the restaurant didn't act on their request until the couple demanded it, that could imply that their request was the trigger, which might not be the best approach. Restaurants are expected to serve all customers unless there's a clear violation of rules.\n\nIn conclusion, while the couple's actions might be understandable from a health and comfort perspective, demanding the removal of a homeless person based on appearance and perceived health risks without concrete evidence could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. The author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own comfort over the rights and dignity of another person in need. However, this is a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The key is whether the couple's actions were necessary and respectful. Since they left and didn't cause further disruption, maybe the main issue is their judgment of the homeless woman. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is wrong) because they acted on assumptions and demanded removal based on discomfort rather than actual health hazards.\n"
