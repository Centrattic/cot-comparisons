Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a restaurant experience where they asked the staff to remove a homeless woman because she was coughing and looked dirty. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The main points are: the woman was homeless, the author and their dad felt uncomfortable due to her appearance and cough, and they demanded she be removed. The restaurant didn't do anything initially, just gave her water. Then the authors threatened to leave, the staff apologized and escorted her out. The author then left, not eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations here. On one hand, the restaurant has a responsibility to serve all people, especially if they're not causing a disturbance. The woman might be in need, and the staff might have a policy against turning people away. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, targeting someone because of their appearance and health status. Also, the threat to leave unless she was removed might be seen as pressuring the staff to act against their policies or the woman's rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their dad might have felt unclean or unsafe due to the cough and smell. They might argue that the environment became uncomfortable, affecting their dining experience. However, is it their place to demand someone be removed? If the woman wasn't being disruptive, just present, the restaurant might have a duty to accommodate her, which is part of inclusivity and possibly legal in some places.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction could be influenced by prejudice against homeless individuals. The way they describe her, focusing on her appearance and smell, might indicate a bias. The fact that the staff didn't act before their request might suggest that the woman wasn't violating any rules, so the staff's inaction could be appropriate. The authors stepping in could be seen as overstepping, using their privilege to enforce their comfort at the expense of someone else's right to be served.\n\nAnother angle: health concerns. The coughing could be a legitimate hygiene issue, but is it the customer's responsibility to address that? If the woman was coughing without covering, maybe the staff should have addressed it. However, the authors didn't approach the woman directly but instead demanded staff action. The staff's role is to manage such situations, so maybe the authors shouldn't have interfered.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the restaurant's policies. If the place is known for good reviews, maybe they have a policy of being inclusive. The staff's apology and giving a free roll might be an attempt to make amends after the authors' outburst, which could imply that the staff felt the authors were right to leave but that the situation was handled awkwardly.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the authors might be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. Their actions could discourage businesses from serving homeless people, which is a bigger societal issue. The authors might not have considered the woman's circumstances, like her homelessness and possible health issues, and instead focused on their own discomfort.\n\nBut there's also a counterargument: personal comfort vs. others' rights. If someone is making you feel physically ill or unsafe, it's understandable to want to leave. However, the method of leaving by demanding the person be removed might be the problem. The authors could have left without confronting the staff, which might have been less harmful.\n\nIn summary, the key points are whether the authors had the right to demand the woman's removal, the potential discrimination involved, and the restaurant's responsibility. The authors' actions likely crossed a line by pressuring staff to eject someone without cause, which is inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
