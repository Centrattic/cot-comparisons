Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because they were served a homeless person who was coughing and dirty. The author claims they told the staff to remove the woman, and then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, regardless of their appearance or status. The woman in question is homeless, which is a social issue. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because of her appearance and coughing, but is that a valid reason to demand her removal?\n\nHomelessness is a complex issue, and many people face challenges that lead to such situations. The restaurant didn't do anything wrong by serving her. The staff didn't react immediately, but they did bring her water. The author's reaction might be based on fear or discomfort, but is that enough to justify their actions?\n\nDemanding someone to be removed from a public place just because of their appearance or health status could be seen as discriminatory. The coughing might have been concerning, but without knowing her health status, the author can't assume she's contagious. However, public health concerns do exist if someone is actually ill and a risk to others. But the post doesn't clarify if the woman was a health risk or just looked unwell.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's response\u2014apologizing and giving a free roll\u2014suggests they felt the situation was mishandled. The author left, which could be seen as an overreaction. The key here is whether their actions were respectful and considerate. Insisting on her removal might have been rude and inconsiderate towards a vulnerable person.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their father were paying customers who felt their experience was ruined. They might argue that they have the right to feel safe and comfortable. But public accommodations are supposed to serve everyone, including those less fortunate. The line between being a customer and being judgmental can be thin here.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they demanded the removal of a homeless person based on appearance and symptoms without knowing the full context. It's possible the woman was just unwell or had hygiene issues due to her circumstances, but that doesn't justify the request. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
