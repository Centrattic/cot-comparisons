Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant after they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and looked unclean. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author and their dad were in a packed restaurant, which is already a bit of a tense environment if you're in a sketchy area. They encountered a homeless woman who was coughing and appeared very dirty. The staff didn't seem to intervene, so the author decided to demand her removal.\n\nOn one hand, the restaurant is a public space and should be accessible to everyone, including homeless individuals. The staff might have a policy of non-discrimination, and the author's request could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the woman's health condition (coughing) might be a real issue, but it's not the customer's place to demand her removal. The smell and appearance could be due to circumstances beyond her control, like homelessness, and the staff should handle such situations without customer intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their dad felt uncomfortable and unsafe. The coughing and smell were so bad that they lost their appetite. The restaurant did apologize and give a free roll, but they still left. The question is whether their reaction was a reasonable response to their discomfort or if it was inconsiderate to the homeless woman's rights to access the restaurant.\n\nI should also think about the concept of \"harm reduction\" and whether the staff should handle such situations discreetly. For example, maybe the staff could have offered her a meal and then asked her to leave without public confrontation. The fact that they didn't do anything until the author and dad intervened might indicate a problem with their policy or response.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, demanding someone to be removed because of their appearance or health condition could be seen as prejudiced. However, the author's primary concern was their own comfort and safety. It's a balance between personal boundaries and social responsibility. The restaurant's role is to serve all customers, but they also need to maintain a clean and safe environment. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as overstepping because they took it upon themselves to address the situation rather than letting the staff handle it. The staff's responsibility is to manage such scenarios, and customers shouldn't be the ones making demands unless there's a direct threat. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's discomfort is understandable, their demand for the woman's removal could be considered discriminatory. The correct approach might have been to inform the staff and let them handle it according to their policies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
