Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person is in the wrong. The situation involves a homeless woman with a severe cough and dirtiness, and the person felt she was a health risk. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Homeless individuals often face discrimination and may already be marginalized. The restaurant is providing a service, and the staff didn't remove her initially. The customers intervened, but is that acceptable?\n\nFrom a rights perspective, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, regardless of their appearance or circumstances. However, public health is a concern, especially if someone is visibly ill. But the restaurant is responsible for handling such situations, not the customers. \n\nThe person's actions\u2014demanding her removal\u2014could be seen as rude and discriminatory. They didn't give the restaurant a chance to handle it, which they eventually did after the request. The smell and cough might be legitimate concerns, but reacting by forcing her out might not be the right approach. Maybe they should have waited for the restaurant's staff to handle it or informed them politely instead of demanding immediately.\n\nAlso, the response of leaving and not eating the free roll shows they were upset. However, the restaurant did apologize and offer compensation, which they refused. This could indicate the person prioritized their discomfort over the restaurant's response.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the person acted out of fear and discomfort but possibly without considering the homeless woman's rights and the restaurant's responsibility. They might be in the wrong for intervening directly and not allowing the restaurant to handle the situation first.\n"
