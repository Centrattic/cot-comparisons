Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was served there. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They went to a new sushi place with their dad. The place was packed, they're happy with the food and service. Then a homeless-looking woman comes in, sits next to them, coughs a lot, looks dirty, and they feel grossed out. They tell the staff to remove her, which they do. Then the couple leaves, not eating the free roll offered. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, from an ethical standpoint, a restaurant should serve everyone, regardless of their appearance or situation. It's a public space, and homeless people shouldn't be discriminated against. But the author's reaction is based on fear of illness and discomfort. The woman's coughing and smell caused them distress. But is demanding her removal discriminatory? \n\nOn the other hand, the staff didn't act initially, which might suggest they didn't see any issue. The patrons then took it upon themselves to ask for her removal. The staff complied, which might imply they didn't have a policy against serving homeless people. But maybe the restaurant should have addressed the situation differently, like offering help instead of removing her. \n\nThe author's motivation here is key. Were they genuinely concerned about health, or was it just discomfort? TB is a serious illness, but unless the woman was confirmed to have it, the author's assumption might be based on appearance. That could be discriminatory. Also, the act of demanding her removal could be seen as bullying or using privilege to exclude someone else. \n\nHowever, the author felt their health was at risk. If someone is visibly sick and coughing, maybe they should inform the staff rather than demanding removal. The staff can assess if there's a health hazard. But in this case, the staff didn't act until the patrons intervened. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be considered inconsiderate. They might be contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. Even if the woman was unwell, the appropriate response would be to inform the staff to handle it, not to demand her removal. The fact that the author left after the woman was escorted out shows they were uncomfortable and maybe felt their experience was ruined. But that doesn't justify their actions. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't discriminate against customers, so a restaurant can't refuse service based on someone being homeless. If the author asked for her removal, the staff had to comply, which might have been against their policies. So the author might be in the wrong for pressuring the staff to discriminate. \n\nBut maybe the staff didn't have a choice if the patrons insisted. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's justification is based on health concerns, but unless there's a clear health risk, their actions could be seen as inappropriate. The answer likely leans towards A, the author being in the wrong.\n"
