Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went to a new restaurant with their dad. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless woman walked in, looked very dirty, had a bad cough, and smelled terrible. The staff didn't do anything, so the author and dad told the restaurant to remove her or they would leave. The staff complied, and they left, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to ask a restaurant to remove a homeless person because of appearance, smell, and health concerns. Let's consider different angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author and their dad were customers. They paid for the food and wanted a comfortable dining experience. The woman's presence might have made them uncomfortable, especially with the cough and smell. They felt they had the right to request her removal to protect their health and comfort. However, this could be seen as discriminatory, as homeless people are protected under certain anti-discrimination laws in some places, especially if the restaurant is serving the public. Restaurants can't just remove someone just because of their appearance unless there's a breach of conduct. So, maybe the author overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was likely homeless and in need of help. The restaurant didn't act until the customers intervened, which might indicate a failure on the restaurant's part to address the situation. But the customers aren't responsible for the restaurant's policies. However, by demanding her removal, the author might have contributed to her being treated poorly. The woman's health issues and hygiene could be due to her circumstances, not her fault. The author's reaction could be seen as judgmental and insensitive.\n\nThe cough sounds serious\u2014maybe TB as they mentioned. That's a health risk. But the author didn't report it to health authorities or suggest that the restaurant should take precautions. Instead, they directly asked for her removal without considering if she was a threat. Maybe they should have handled it differently, like asking the staff to provide masks or something, but that's speculative.\n\nAnother point: the restaurant gave them a free roll and apologized. That might suggest they felt the customers had a valid complaint, but it's also possible they wanted to avoid a scene. However, the restaurant's action of removing her might have been appropriate if she was violating their policies, though policies around appearance can be legally tricky.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility. The author might argue they were protecting their health, but others might say they were being prejudiced against a vulnerable person. The line between being a customer and being a bully is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they demanded the removal of a homeless person based on her appearance and symptoms, which could be discriminatory. The restaurant's inaction might not be their fault if they don't have a policy against such situations, but the customers shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to enforce that.\n"
