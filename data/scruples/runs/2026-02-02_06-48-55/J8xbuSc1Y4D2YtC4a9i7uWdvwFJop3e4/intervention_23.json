Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The scenario involves the author and their dad going to a new sushi restaurant in a sketchy area. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless-looking woman entered, coughed a lot, looked dirty, and had a bad smell. The staff didn't intervene, so the author and dad demanded she be removed. The staff apologized, escorted her out, but they still left without touching the free roll and check.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The answer options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Let's analyze.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the woman is homeless, which is a sensitive issue. The author describes her as coughing, dirty, and smelly. They confronted the staff, leading to her removal, then left. The question is about whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, turning away someone in need, especially if they're homeless, can be seen as inconsiderate. Homewless individuals often face societal stigma and might rely on such places for meals. By demanding her removal, the author could be contributing to that stigma. Also, the restaurant might have policies against refusing service to anyone, unless there's a health violation, which the woman might not be violating unless she's actually sick with an infectious disease. The author's assumption that she's sick might be based on her cough and appearance, but without confirmation, that could be prejudice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel uncomfortable for legitimate reasons: health concerns (cough sounds dangerous), smell, and appearance. They might have felt it was a personal choice to leave, not forcing the restaurant to remove her, but their demand could be seen as pressuring the staff. Also, the restaurant's response was to apologize and give a free roll, yet the author still left, which might indicate that the issue was more about discomfort than a genuine health threat.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, demanding someone to leave a public space based on appearance might be considered rude. Restaurants are public spaces where people of all backgrounds should be welcome. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory if the woman was not actually a threat. Even if the author felt uncomfortable, confronting the staff and causing her to leave might not be the right approach. Instead, perhaps they could have left quietly without confronting the staff, or addressed their own discomfort without affecting the homeless person's experience.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal choice in where one dines. The author paid for their meal and has the right to choose not to eat in that environment. But the way they handled it\u2014demanding staff to remove someone\u2014might be the issue. It's not about the decision to leave but about the method of causing her removal and the underlying judgment.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals. Even though they felt uncomfortable, using their position to enforce removal might be the wrong approach. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
