Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after they saw a homeless person being served. The situation is described as the person and their dad going to a new sushi place, which was in a sketchy area but had good reviews. They were at the sushi bar, enjoying the food, when a homeless-looking woman with a terrible cough came in and sat next to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was a customer, and the restaurant didn't ask her to leave until the author and their dad demanded it. The staff tried to accommodate by giving her water but didn't remove her. Then the author and their dad threatened to leave unless she was removed. The staff then escorted her out, and the author left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the restaurant serves all customers regardless of their condition. The staff didn't ask the woman to leave, so the author stepping in could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. They might be discriminating against her because she's homeless. Also, making others uncomfortable because of someone's appearance or health status could be considered a form of judgment or bias.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt genuinely unwell due to the cough and smell. They might have been concerned about health and hygiene, especially in a place where they're eating. The restaurant's responsibility is to all customers, but the author's reaction might be seen as overstepping, especially if the staff didn't see it as a problem.\n\nHomelessness is a complex issue, and a restaurant shouldn't deny service. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the stigma against homeless people. However, if the woman was visibly unwell and the environment was affecting the dining experience, the author might feel they were protecting their health.\n\nBut the key point is that the restaurant didn't remove her, and the author took it upon themselves to do so. That could be seen as disrespectful to both the staff and the woman. The restaurant might have policies in place to handle such situations, and the author's intervention might be unnecessary. Also, the author's reaction might have been based on fear or discomfort, which isn't a valid reason to demand someone else's removal.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have the right to leave a business if they're uncomfortable, demanding the removal of a customer is generally not their responsibility. The staff should handle such situations, and the author's actions might be considered rude or discriminatory. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
