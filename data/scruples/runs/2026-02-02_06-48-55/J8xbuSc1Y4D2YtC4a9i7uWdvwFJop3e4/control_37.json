Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. It was packed, so they sat at the sushi bar. Everything was going well until a homeless woman entered, sat next to them, had a terrible cough, and was very dirty. The person and their dad told the restaurant staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll. Now, they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's consider the actions. The restaurant is serving a homeless person, which the author might have an issue with. But is that the case? The problem here isn't just that she's homeless; it's her appearance and coughing. The author was concerned about health and safety. The homelesss person was coughing a lot, which could be a health concern, especially in a restaurant where food is served. The smell and dirtiness might also be a concern, but that's more about personal appearance.\n\nNow, the author and dad told the staff to remove her. The staff did so, and then the author left. The question is whether this is wrong. On one hand, the restaurant has a right to serve anyone as long as they're not breaking the law. On the other hand, if the person posed a health risk, the restaurant might have a responsibility to address that. But how does the restaurant handle that? They should have protocols for health issues. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory if they're targeting her because she's homeless, but if the person was genuinely a health hazard, maybe the restaurant should have taken action.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't ask the staff to remove her for being homeless; they did so because of her cough and appearance. The author might believe she's a health risk. However, the staff didn't seem to react at first, just brought her water. The author and dad had to demand her removal. The staff then apologized and removed her. The restaurant might have policies against that, or they might not. If the person was a health risk, they could have a right to remove her. But if it's just appearance, that's different. The author might be overreacting, but if there's a legitimate health concern, maybe not. However, leaving immediately after could be seen as a harsh reaction, even if the restaurant complied. It depends on whether the restaurant's actions were sufficient. The author might feel they couldn't eat after that, but maybe they could have handled it differently. Also, the act of demanding her removal could be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. So, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they judged someone based on appearance and health without knowing the full story, and perhaps the restaurant should have handled it themselves. Or B if the health concerns were valid. It's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of social norms, it's not considered acceptable to demand someone else be removed from a public place just because they look different or are sick. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
