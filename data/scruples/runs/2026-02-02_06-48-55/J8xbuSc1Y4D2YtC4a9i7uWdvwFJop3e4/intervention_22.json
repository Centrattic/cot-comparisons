Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The person wrote about encountering a woman who looked very dirty and was coughing, which made them uncomfortable. They asked the restaurant staff to remove her, and when they did, the person and their dad left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue seems to be whether it's acceptable to ask a restaurant to remove a homeless person based on appearance and health concerns. On one hand, everyone has the right to be served in a public establishment unless they're causing harm. On the other hand, the presence of someone who's visibly unwell and dirty might make others uncomfortable, especially in a place like a restaurant where cleanliness is expected.\n\nBut wait, the woman wasn't causing any direct harm\u2014she was just there, coughing. The restaurant didn't ask her to leave initially, and the staff did provide her with water. The customers felt compelled to intervene. That raises questions about their right to demand the removal of a patron. Are customers entitled to ask staff to eject someone? That's usually up to the restaurant's discretion. Also, the woman might have been a legitimate customer, perhaps needing a meal, and the act of refusing service could be discriminatory.\n\nThe person mentions the woman's appearance and smell as reasons for discomfort. While those are valid personal feelings, acting on them to remove someone else from a public place could be seen as inconsiderate or prejudiced. The restaurant did apologize and give a free roll, but the customers still left. Was their reaction proportionate? Maybe they overreacted, assuming the worst without considering the situation from the woman's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: public health. If the coughing was severe, maybe there were legitimate health concerns. However, the restaurant staff didn't take action, so perhaps they assessed the situation as not a threat. The customers might have overstepped by taking matters into their own hands, even if their intentions were to protect others from potential illness or discomfort.\n\nAlso, the fact that the restaurant is in a sketchy area might imply that they serve a diverse clientele, including those who are homeless or less fortunate. The customers' decision to leave could be seen as elitist or classist, avoiding a place because it serves people they perceive as lower status.\n\nOn the other hand, the person's dad and they were paying customers, and they were within their rights to leave if they felt uncomfortable. The question is whether their demand to remove the woman was justified. If the woman was a regular customer or someone in need, removing her could have negative consequences for her. The customers might not have considered that.\n\nSo, balancing these points: the customers acted on their discomfort, potentially violating the rights of another person by demanding her removal. The restaurant's role is to serve all customers unless there's a breach of conduct. The authors' actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory, thus they could be in the wrong. However, the line between personal comfort and public responsibility is blurry here. The answer might depend on whether the act of leaving was justified, but the act of demanding removal of the woman is what's questionable. Hence, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
