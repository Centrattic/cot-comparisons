Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. A homeless woman with a severe cough joined them. The author was disturbed by her appearance and smell, leading them to demand the restaurant remove her. The employees did, but the author left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the main question is whether they're at fault. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the restaurant is open to the public and should serve everyone regardless of their circumstances. The homeless woman had a right to be there, and the customers' reaction might be seen as discriminatory or lacking empathy. The author's decision to leave could be viewed as prioritizing their own comfort over someone in need, which might be considered unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's health condition (a TB-like cough) could pose a health risk, especially in a food establishment. The smell and appearance could also be a concern for other patrons' comfort. The author and their dad might have felt that the restaurant wasn't maintaining a safe environment, so they took action. However, the appropriate response might have been to address the health risk through proper channels, like informing staff discreetly rather than making a scene.\n\nThe restaurant's response was to apologize, escort her out, and offer compensation, which suggests they tried to resolve the issue. The customers' immediate demand to remove her might have been abrupt and not the best approach. Public health concerns aside, the act of demanding removal could be seen as disrespectful to both the staff and the homeless woman.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. While the situation was unpleasant, there are more empathetic ways to handle it. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they prioritized their own discomfort and made a judgment about the homeless woman, potentially contributing to stigma and exclusion. However, it's a nuanced situation where public health and personal ethics intersect.\n"
