Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person with a bad cough and dirty appearance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant is providing service to all customers, including those in need. The homeless woman was there, and the patrons asked her to leave because of her appearance and cough. That seems a bit harsh.\n\nThe author and their dad demanded the restaurant to remove the woman. Was that their right? Restaurants can ask people to leave if they're causing a disturbance or violating health codes, but a homeless person with a cough might not necessarily fit that. The smell and coughing were cited as reasons, but that could be seen as discriminatory or unkind.\n\nThe author's justification is health concerns due to the cough and smell. However, unless there was a clear health risk (like confirmed contagious illness), this could be an overreaction. Also, the restaurant did offer her a glass of water, so maybe they were trying to accommodate her. The patrons' immediate reaction to ask her to leave might be seen as rude or judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was uncomfortable and felt it affected their dining experience. But is that a valid reason to demand someone else be removed? Public spaces should ideally be inclusive. The author's actions might be seen as exploiting the restaurant's hospitality and then punishing them for serving a vulnerable person.\n\nAlso, the restaurant did apologize and give a free roll, but the patrons still left. Whether they overreacted depends on perspective. Some might argue they had a right to ask for a better environment, others might say it's not their place to dictate who gets served.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman and possibly discriminatory. They didn't consider other solutions, like moving tables or using masks, and instead demanded her removal. So, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong).\n"
