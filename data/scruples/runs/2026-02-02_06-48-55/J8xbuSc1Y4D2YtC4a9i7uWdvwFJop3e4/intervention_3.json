Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they had to sit at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, started coughing, and looked really dirty. The restaurant didn't do anything, so the author and their dad demanded the woman be removed. She was escorted out, they left, and now they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are the treatment of a homeless person, the health concerns, and the restaurant's responsibility. The woman was homeless, which is a vulnerable population. The restaurant didn't intervene when the customers asked them to remove her. Then the customers left because of the smell and coughing.\n\nOn one hand, the customers were in a restaurant, and it's understandable to be concerned about hygiene and health, especially with a person who had a bad cough and smell. People might feel uncomfortable or worried about getting sick. On the other hand, the woman was a customer too, and the restaurant allowed her to stay. The customers took it upon themselves to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory against homeless individuals. \n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and while the customers might have their reasons for discomfort, it's not their role to eject someone from a public space unless there's immediate danger. The restaurant is responsible for handling such situations, perhaps by offering assistance or ensuring health standards are met. The customers' reaction could be seen as inconsiderate and contributing to the stigmatization of homeless people. \n\nHowever, the situation might have different angles. If the woman was indeed a health risk (like having a contagious illness), then the restaurant should have taken action. But the customers didn't have evidence of that beyond the cough. Also, the restaurant didn't act when the customers asked, which might have justified their frustration. But demanding her removal without the restaurant's intervention could be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the customers were within their rights to leave if they felt uncomfortable, but the way they handled it\u2014demanding removal\u2014could be problematic. The restaurant might have had a policy to handle such cases, and the customers didn't let the restaurant address it. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they took matters into their own hands regarding a vulnerable person without clear justification. The restaurant's lack of action doesn't absolve the customers of potential blame for contributing to a hostile environment toward the homeless woman. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
