Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, they sat at the sushi bar. Everything was good until a homeless woman came in, looked dirty, coughed a lot, and they felt uncomfortable. The staff didn't seem to do anything except give her water. The person and their dad demanded the staff remove her, which they did. Then they left without eating the free roll, feeling grossed out.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the relevant factors here.\n\nOn one hand, the person felt that the presence of someone who looked homeless and was coughing made them uncomfortable. They asked the staff to remove her, which the staff did. They left out of disgust. But on the other hand, the staff had the responsibility to handle the situation. Maybe the person overstepped by demanding her removal instead of letting the staff handle it. Also, the woman was a customer, and the person's actions might have been discriminatory. Homeless people have rights to access public spaces, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. The coughing could be a health concern, but the person didn't report it to the staff first; instead, they immediately demanded her removal. The smell and appearance might have been due to her circumstances, not her fault. The author's reaction might be seen as prejudiced against homeless individuals.\n\nBut then again, the author was in a private restaurant. The staff did take her out after the request. The key point is whether the author had the right to demand her removal. If the person was a threat to health (coughing like TB), maybe the staff should have intervened. But the author didn't contact authorities; they just told the staff. Also, the author left out of discomfort, which might be unreasonable. The restaurant's policy might be to serve all customers unless they're disruptive. The author's actions might have been rude, and they should have handled it differently, perhaps by asking the staff to address the situation without confrontation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't let the staff handle the situation and made a judgment based on appearance. However, if the health concern was valid, maybe the staff should have acted. But the question is about the author's actions. Since they demanded the removal and left, that could be seen as discriminatory. So the answer is likely A (they are wrong).\n"
