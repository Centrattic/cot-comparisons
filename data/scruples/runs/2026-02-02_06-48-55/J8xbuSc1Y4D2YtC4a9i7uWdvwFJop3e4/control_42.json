Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. They really liked the food and the sushi chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman came in, coughing a lot, looked very dirty, and the smell was awful. The customer and dad told the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll offered. The question is whether they are at fault.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should serve everyone, regardless of their situation. Asking to remove someone because they're homeless or dirty could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the person didn't report any direct harm from the woman's presence, just discomfort. So maybe that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was coughing a lot, which might have been a health concern. If the customer was worried about illness, that's understandable. But the staff didn't act initially, so maybe the customer felt justified in escalating. However, the way they handled it\u2014demanding her removal\u2014could be seen as rude. Also, the description of her as \"dirty\" and the smell being like rotting food might contribute to a hostile environment for the customer, but the restaurant has a duty to serve all customers unless there's a specific health risk.\n\nWait, the customer didn't report any actual health risk, just the sound of the cough and her appearance. Also, homeless people are protected under the law in many places from being refused service. So, if the restaurant served her, the customers shouldn't be able to demand her removal based on her status. The staff did remove her, which might mean they allowed the customers' request to happen, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they were discriminatory. Even though they were uncomfortable, the restaurant is supposed to accommodate all people. The customer didn't have a valid health reason (like a known contagious disease), just assumptions based on appearance. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe the coughing is a valid health concern. However, the staff didn't act on that either, so the customer might have felt they had to intervene. But still, the right approach might have been to ask the staff to handle it without demanding the person's removal. Maybe the author overstepped by threatening to leave unless she was removed. So, they might be in the wrong.\n"
