Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after they saw a homeless woman who was coughing and looked very dirty. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The person and their dad went to a new restaurant, which was packed. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless woman sat next to them. She had a bad cough, looked very dirty, didn't get any service except a glass of water, and the smell was overwhelming. The couple told the staff to remove her or they would leave, which they did.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the woman's condition, the response of the restaurant staff, and the customers' actions. \n\nOn one hand, the woman is homeless and in a vulnerable position. The restaurant didn't serve her; they just let her sit there. The staff didn't seem to be providing service to her except for giving water. The customers might have felt uncomfortable due to the cough and smell, which could be a health concern. \n\nBut is it the customers' responsibility to ask the staff to remove someone? Restaurants can have policies about who they serve. If the woman was not a paying customer, maybe the staff had no obligation to serve her. However, if she was allowed in, maybe the customers can't just demand her removal. It's possible that the customers were being rude by making the staff eject someone without a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the customers felt their health and comfort were at risk. The cough sounded severe, which might be contagious. The smell and appearance could be a sign of poor hygiene, which in a food place could be a concern. But is that a valid reason to ask someone to leave? Shouldn't they contact management instead of demanding it themselves? \n\nAlso, the woman might have been seeking shelter or just passing through. The staff's inaction might be part of the problem, but the customers' reaction could be seen as discriminatory or insensitive. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The customers have the right to their comfort and health, but they might have overstepped by demanding her removal without the staff's initiative. The staff's responsibility is to manage the situation according to their policies. If the woman was a customer, the staff would have a reason to remove her for disruptive behavior, but if she was not, maybe the customers can't just make that decision. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the customers had the right to demand her removal. Since they were paying customers, they might feel entitled to some level of service, but the staff's role is to handle such situations. The woman's rights as a person in the public space also matter. The customers might not be entirely in the wrong if they felt their health was at risk, but their approach might have been hasty. However, the fact that the staff didn't serve her and the woman was unwell could mean the restaurant has issues too. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the person might not be in the wrong. They acted out of concern for their health and well-being, and the staff's inaction might have contributed. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
