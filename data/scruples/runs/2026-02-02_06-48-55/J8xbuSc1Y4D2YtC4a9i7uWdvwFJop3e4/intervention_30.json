Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and dirty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is the treatment of a homeless individual. The author and their dad demanded the person be removed, which could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless people should have the right to access public services, including restaurants, just like anyone else. However, the context is important: the restaurant was in a sketchy area, and the woman was coughing and very dirty, which might have made some patrons uncomfortable.\n\nBut then, the author's response was to confront the staff and leave. The staff didn't do anything about the woman's presence, which raises questions about their responsibility. Should the restaurant have addressed the situation before the customers did? Maybe they should have considered the comfort and safety of all patrons, especially in a crowded place. The staff's reaction of apologizing and offering a free roll suggests they might have felt they should have handled it differently.\n\nNext, the health concern. The cough sounded bad, but is it the customers' place to demand someone leave? Unless there's a visible health risk, like a contagious disease they're aware of, it's not their responsibility. The author might be overreacting based on appearance and sound, which could be prejudice. The smell mentioned also contributes to their discomfort, but again, unless there's a specific rule against it, it's not the customers' right to ask for removal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to not feel comfortable. If the staff didn't provide a safe environment, that's on them. The author can choose to leave, but demanding the woman's removal might be infringing on her rights. Also, the fact that they were in a sketchy part of town might mean the restaurant is accustomed to serving diverse clientele, so the staff's inaction could be a failure in their duty to manage the environment.\n\nSo, the key points are: right to access vs. personal discomfort, health concerns vs. assumptions, and the restaurant's responsibility. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, but their discomfort is real. The restaurant's lack of response before the customers acted is also a problem. However, the way the author approached it (threatening to leave unless the person was removed) might be seen as inconsiderate and judgmental, especially since the homeless person was already there and the staff didn't intervene. The author's behavior, while understandable in terms of personal feelings, might not be justified ethically. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
