Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The story is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless woman was being served there. The key points here are the actions taken by the author and their dad, and the context.\n\nFirst, the restaurant was serving a homeless person, which some might argue is a positive thing, especially if the place is known for helping the homeless. However, the author felt uncomfortable due to the woman's appearance and coughing. They demanded the staff remove her, which the staff did. The question is whether this was the right move.\n\nThe author claims they were worried about health and hygiene, citing the cough and smell. But is that a valid reason? Homeless individuals often face stigma and may not have access to regular hygiene facilities. The staff's initial response of just providing water might indicate they were trying to accommodate her without causing a scene. The author's demand to remove her could be seen as discriminatory, as it's based on her appearance and health status. \n\nOn the other hand, no one else in the restaurant reacted, and the staff didn't intervene unless asked. The author and their dad felt their experience was ruined, leading them to leave. But forcing someone to leave because of their appearance could be considered rude or exclusionary. \n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. Some might say that the restaurant should serve everyone regardless of their situation, and that the author was being judgmental. Others might empathize with the author's discomfort in a public space. The key is whether their actions were justified. Since the staff did remove the woman after the author's demand, it's possible the restaurant has policies in place, but the author's initial demand could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they demanded the removal of a homeless person based on her appearance and symptoms, which could be seen as discriminatory and lacking empathy.\n"
