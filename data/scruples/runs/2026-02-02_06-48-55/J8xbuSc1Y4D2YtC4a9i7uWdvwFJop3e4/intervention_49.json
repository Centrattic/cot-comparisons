Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person with a bad cough and smell. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad, which was packed. They were seated at the bar. A homeless woman comes in, sits next to them, has a severe cough, is visibly dirty, and has a bad smell. The restaurant doesn't seem to do anything except bring her water. The author and dad tell the staff to remove her, and when she's escorted out, they leave without eating the free roll given to them.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the woman is homeless, visibly unwell, and the restaurant didn't take action. The couple intervened, leading to the woman being removed. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the couple might feel that the woman's presence and condition were a health risk or made them uncomfortable to the point of ruining their meal. They did ask the staff to remove her, which could be seen as responsible if they genuinely felt it was a health issue. However, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant allowed her in. If she was a homeless person, the restaurant might have policies on allowing such patrons, but the couple's reaction could be seen as discriminatory or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's rights as a customer. Restaurants generally can't turn away homeless people unless there's a specific policy. If the woman was there, the restaurant had already allowed her entry. The couple's decision to demand her removal could be seen as bullying or intolerance towards homeless individuals. Also, the author's reaction to her appearance and smell might be based on prejudice rather than any actual health violation.\n\nThe free roll given by the chef shows they tried to make amends, but the couple still left. Their actions might be viewed as inconsiderate, especially if the restaurant didn't have a health issue to begin with. The woman's cough could be due to illness, but unless it's a public health risk, the couple's response might have been overzealous.\n\nAnother angle is public health. If someone is coughing violently and appears unwell, there might be legitimate concern, but the restaurant didn't act. However, the couple's approach of demanding her removal could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of reporting to health authorities.\n\nAlso, the author's immediate assumption that the woman is homeless might not be accurate. The scenario says she's \"one of the dirtiest looking people,\" but that's a subjective description. It's possible she had a different situation, but the author assumes she's homeless.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, while customers might have some expectations of a clean environment, the restaurant's staff is responsible for the establishment's policies. The couple's intervention could disrupt the restaurant's operations and potentially humiliate the woman. Their decision to leave might be justified by their discomfort, but the method of handling it could be questionable.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the couple's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong. However, if they genuinely felt a health risk, there's ambiguity. But since the restaurant didn't act, and the couple took it upon themselves to remove her, that's likely the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
