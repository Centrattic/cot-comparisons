Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and when a homeless woman with a bad cough and poor hygiene was served, they demanded she be removed and then left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Is it right to ask a homeless person to leave a restaurant? Homelessness is a social issue, and everyone has the right to enter public places, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman in the story wasn't causing immediate harm; she was just eating. The author and their dad were the ones who felt uncomfortable and demanded she leave. That could be seen as discriminatory or disrespectful towards the homeless.\n\nThe cough is mentioned as sounding like TB. While health concerns are valid, the restaurant staff didn't act on it. The customers taking it upon themselves to remove her might overstep their role. Unless there's a clear and present danger to health and safety, customers aren't in a position to demand someone's removal. That's up to the staff and management, following health codes.\n\nThe smell and appearance were off-putting, but that's a personal reaction. The author chose to leave, which is their right, but the initial demand to remove the woman could be problematic. The restaurant did offer a free roll as an apology, but the customers still left. The question is about whether the initial action was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the woman was indeed a health risk, maybe the staff should have addressed it. But the author's reaction might have been based on fear or stigma rather than actual danger. The story doesn't mention the woman violating any rules or causing a disturbance. So the author's response might be considered inconsiderate or prejudiced.\n\nIn summary, the author's action of demanding the woman's removal and then leaving could be seen as the wrong approach, as it's not their place to eject someone from a public establishment. They should have addressed their discomfort with the staff first, perhaps discreetly, but taking it upon themselves to remove a customer is likely the wrong action. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
