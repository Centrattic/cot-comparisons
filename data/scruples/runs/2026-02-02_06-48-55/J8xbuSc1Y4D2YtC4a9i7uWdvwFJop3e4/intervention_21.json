Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The story is that they went to a new sushi place, which was crowded, and when a visibly homeless woman with a bad cough came in, they demanded she be removed, then left. The restaurant didn't serve her much except water, but the author felt disgusted and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, looked very dirty, and had a severe cough. The restaurant didn't do anything about it except give her water. The authors confronted the staff, demanded she be removed, and left when she was escorted out. They felt they were justified because of the health concerns from her cough and smell.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. On one hand, the authors have the right to feel uncomfortable and want to protect their health. If someone is coughing violently, it could be a health risk. On the other hand, the woman is homeless, which is a vulnerable population, and the restaurant might have a policy to serve everyone regardless of appearance or status. The authors' actions could be seen as discriminatory, treating someone poorly because of their homelessness and appearance.\n\nBut then, the restaurant didn't take action until the authors intervened. If the staff didn't see her as a threat, maybe they were doing their job by providing service, but the customers felt they had to take matters into their own hands. However, customers don't have the authority to demand someone's removal unless there's a legitimate safety concern. The authors might be overstepping by not letting the staff handle the situation first.\n\nAlso, the woman's health condition (coughing) could be a real concern, especially if it's contagious. But assuming she has TB without knowing is speculative. The authors might be making an assumption based on the sound of the cough, which isn't a valid reason to ask someone to leave. Plus, the smell mentioned is likely due to homelessness and lack of access to hygiene facilities, which is a societal issue, not the woman's fault.\n\nThe restaurant giving her a free roll as an apology might indicate they didn't support the authors' actions and felt bad for what happened. The authors left without eating the free food, which shows they were upset, but it's unclear if the restaurant was in the wrong for serving her.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, treating homeless individuals with dignity is important. The authors' reaction might be based on fear or misunderstanding rather than malice. However, their actions could contribute to stigma and discrimination against the homeless.\n\nSo, the authors might be in the wrong because they didn't give the restaurant staff the chance to handle the situation, made assumptions about the woman's health, and treated her poorly due to her homelessness. They should have considered alternatives, like moving seats or asking the staff to check on her health if it was a safety concern. Their demand to remove her was possibly discriminatory and not based on evidence of a threat.\n"
