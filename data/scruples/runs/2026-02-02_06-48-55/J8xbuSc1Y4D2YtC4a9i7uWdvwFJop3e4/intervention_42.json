Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a restaurant with their dad, and a homeless woman came in. The author describes her as looking really dirty and coughing badly, which made them uncomfortable. They asked the restaurant to remove her, which they did, and then the author left without eating the free roll. The question is whether they are the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant served a homeless person, which the author is upset about. But is that a valid reason to leave? The author's main complaints are about the woman's appearance and the sound of her cough, which they found disturbing. They felt like they would throw up and lost their appetite. They confronted the staff, who then removed her. \n\nNow, thinking about social norms and ethics. Homelessness is a complex issue, and serving homeless people is part of a restaurant's role in the community. However, the author's actions were based on the woman's appearance and their own discomfort. The question is whether their reaction was justified. \n\nThe woman was a customer, and the staff allowed her to stay. The author's request to have her removed might be seen as discriminatory if it's based solely on her homelessness. However, the author mentions the cough, which they thought sounded like TB. There's a public health concern there. But TB is contagious through the air, and if someone is coughing that bad, maybe the staff should have intervened. However, the staff didn't, which might reflect on the restaurant's policies rather than the author's actions.\n\nBut the author's decision to leave could be seen as a personal choice, especially if they felt their health was at risk. However, the initial act of asking to remove the woman might be the point of contention. If the staff didn't take action immediately, but the author did, maybe the staff's inaction is part of the issue. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the rights of a homeless person to access a restaurant. The restaurant is a public space, and turning away a customer based on their appearance could be considered wrong. The fact that the staff finally removed her after the author's intervention might mean that the author's action was necessary, but ethically, it's problematic if it's based on prejudice.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction to the smell after she was escorted out. That's a sensory experience that's hard to control. But the initial request to remove her was based on appearance and cough. \n\nI think the line here is between health concerns and discrimination. If the cough was genuinely a health risk, maybe the author had a point. But if it's just discomfort due to appearance, then it's more about bias. The story says the restaurant was packed, so maybe the woman was there for a legitimate reason, like needing a meal. The author's action could be seen as inconsiderate towards a vulnerable person. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for prioritizing their own discomfort over the rights of the homeless woman to be served. Unless there was a real health threat, which isn't clear here. The author's perception of the cough might not be accurate (maybe it's not TB), so acting on that could be unfounded. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
