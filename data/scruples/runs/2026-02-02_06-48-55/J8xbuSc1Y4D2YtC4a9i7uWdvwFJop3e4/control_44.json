Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. The food was great, but then a homeless woman entered, sat next to them, and had a terrible cough. She was visibly unclean, and the author and their dad demanded she be removed. The staff complied, and they left without eating the free roll. The question is whether they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, which is a social issue. The restaurant didn't ask her to leave initially, so maybe they have a policy of serving everyone. The author's concern was health and safety due to the cough and smell. However, homeless people often have hygiene challenges not of their choosing. The restaurant staff handled it by removing her, but maybe they should have addressed the situation privately instead of letting the customers make the request.\n\nEthically, is it right to ask someone to leave just because of their appearance and health? Homelessness is a complex issue, and judging someone based on their appearance could be seen as discriminatory. The author's actions might be viewed as inconsiderate, especially if the woman was a patron. However, if the woman was indeed a health risk (like coughing with TB symptoms), there might be public health concerns. But the author's reaction was immediate, maybe without verifying if she was a threat. \n\nAlso, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, regardless of their background. Letting the author and dad demand her removal could be seen as allowing bias. The staff's apology and giving a free roll might indicate they felt bad about the situation, suggesting that the authors' actions were not in line with the restaurant's values.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors were concerned for their health and felt uncomfortable. They did leave after the woman was removed, so they didn't stay to take advantage. But the initial request to remove her might have been rude. It's possible that the restaurant should have handled the situation more discreetly, perhaps by cleaning up or providing a mask, rather than removing her entirely.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to be concerned about health, publicly demanding someone to leave based on their appearance is generally frowned upon. It could be seen as contributing to the stigma against homeless individuals. The authors might be in the wrong for not considering the broader implications and for not giving the restaurant more time to handle the issue themselves.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they judged the homeless woman based on her appearance and health without knowing her situation, and perhaps overstepped by demanding she be removed. The restaurant should have handled it, and the authors' reaction could be seen as discriminatory.\n"
