Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who left the restaurant because they were serving a homeless woman is in the wrong. The situation is from a Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. So I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The restaurant was busy, and they sat at the bar. Then a homeless woman came in, looked very dirty, and had a bad cough. The staff didn't do much except give her water. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, and after she left, they left too even after getting a free roll.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author felt uncomfortable because of the woman's appearance and cough, which could be seen as a health concern. But on the other hand, the woman is homeless, and the restaurant might be trying to provide a service to someone in need. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory or classist, treating the woman as a disruption rather than a customer. Also, the author didn't ask the staff if there was a reason she was there or if she was a health risk. They just demanded her removal. \n\nBut wait, the author was concerned about health. If someone is coughing, it could be a legitimate hygiene issue. However, the staff didn't seem concerned, only gave her water. The author might have overreacted, but maybe they had a valid concern. However, the main issue here is treating the homeless woman as a problem to be removed rather than a customer. Restaurants should serve all people regardless of their circumstances, unless there's a direct safety issue. The author's immediate demand to remove her shows a lack of empathy and possibly contributing to the stigma against the homeless. \n\nThe author left after the woman was removed, which could be seen as them prioritizing their comfort over someone else's need for a meal. So the ethical consideration is about balancing personal discomfort with social responsibility. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the woman's situation and made a judgment based on her appearance and their own fear. The correct action might have been to speak to the staff first or at least not to leave, but to address their concerns without being discriminatory. So the answer would be A.\n"
