Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left the restaurant because they were serving a homeless woman is in the wrong. The scenario is presented from the author's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, so they sat at the bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless-looking woman walked in, sat near them, coughed loudly, looked dirty, and had a bad smell. The author and dad told the staff to remove her, which they did. They left without eating the free roll and felt they weren't in the wrong. The question is if they are the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the restaurant serves everyone, and the woman might be a customer in need. The staff didn't ask her to leave, so maybe the author was being rude by demanding her removal. Also, the woman's health and hygiene could be a public health concern, but it's not the customers' responsibility to enforce that. On the other hand, if the woman was ill and contagious, it could be a safety issue. However, the author's reaction might be based on fear or discomfort rather than a real threat.\n\nI should consider societal expectations. It's generally frowned upon to discriminate against someone based on their appearance. The author's actions could be seen as prejudiced. The restaurant's role is to serve all customers, so the author's demand to remove her might be inappropriate. However, if the woman was a health risk, the restaurant should handle it, but the author didn't have to confront them directly. They could have left instead of demanding action. The fact that they left after the woman was escorted out might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than being confrontational.\n\nAlso, the author's justification: the coughing and smell affected their comfort. But other customers might also be uncomfortable. However, it's not their place to police the restaurant's customers. The restaurant's responsibility is to handle such situations, not the patrons. So, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. The answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they took it upon themselves to demand the woman's removal instead of just leaving if they were uncomfortable. The restaurant did take action, but the author's approach could be considered rude or discriminatory.\n"
