Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their dad went to a new restaurant. It was packed, they were at the sushi bar, and then a homeless woman came in. She was coughing, looked very dirty, and the staff didn't seem to do much except give her water. The author and dad demanded the restaurant to remove her. They were escorted out, the author left because of the smell and discomfort, and the restaurant offered a free roll but they didn't eat it.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether it's wrong to ask the restaurant to remove a homeless person, especially when the staff didn't act. The author's reasoning is that the woman was sick, looked dirty, and the smell made them uncomfortable to the point of losing their appetite. \n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, the rights of the homeless person. Everyone has the right to be served in public places unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman wasn't causing a disturbance initially, just sitting there. The staff gave her water, which might mean they were following their policy. The author and dad intervened, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt genuinely uncomfortable, even to the point of throwing up the food. The coughing and smell might have been a legitimate health concern, but is that a valid reason to ask the restaurant to remove someone? Also, the restaurant did apologize and offer a free roll, but the customers still left. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting others and personal discomfort. If the woman was a health risk, maybe the staff should have intervened, but the customers taking it upon themselves to demand her removal might be the wrong approach. Homeless people already face a lot of stigma, and this could be seen as discriminatory. However, the author's reaction might be based on a real fear of illness, even if it's not rational. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In similar situations, people often argue that the customers shouldn't take matters into their own hands and should instead talk to the staff respectfully. The staff might have protocols to handle such cases without involving customers. The author's direct demand could be seen as rude and possibly discriminatory. \n\nAlso, the restaurant did escort her out eventually, so maybe the staff had their own reasons. The author's actions might have contributed to the woman being asked to leave, which could be considered unkind. \n\nIn terms of \"are we the assholes,\" the story might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they prioritized their own discomfort over the rights of another person, even if that person was homeless. However, some might argue that the author's health concerns were valid. \n\nBut in the context of AITA, the community often looks at whether the person acted inconsiderately. Here, the author didn't have to leave, but they did because of their discomfort. The fact that they demanded the woman's removal and then left without eating might be seen as the wrong action. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and didn't allow the restaurant to handle the situation, possibly infringing on the woman's rights. Their reaction was based on appearance and symptoms, which could be discriminatory.\n"
