Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe person went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then, a homeless woman walked in, sat next to them, coughed a lot, looked very dirty, and the smell was overwhelming. The couple told the staff to remove her, which they did. They left without eating the free roll and felt they were justified.\n\nI need to consider different angles. First, the restaurant's responsibility. They should accommodate all patrons, including those who might be homeless. But if someone is visibly unwell, maybe they have a duty to protect other customers' health. However, the woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond being there and coughing. Was it right to ask to remove her?\n\nThe person might be in the wrong because they judged someone based on appearance and demanded she leave, which could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless individuals often face stigma, and asking for their removal might be seen as pushing them out of public spaces. Restaurants can't just kick out customers unless they're violating rules (like causing a disturbance, being a health hazard). The woman wasn't violent or causing a scene beyond sitting and coughing. The smell and cough might be concerning, but it's not clear if she was actually a health risk. The restaurant did offer her water, maybe because they couldn't remove her without cause.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person felt their health was at risk because of the cough, especially if they were worried about contagious illnesses, maybe they had a reason. But TB is a severe illness that would require a medical response, not just removing someone from a restaurant. Also, the restaurant employees didn't seem to act until the customers demanded it. So maybe the staff didn't see her as a problem, but the customers did.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The person left because they felt unclean or unsafe. However, their actions might have contributed to the marginalization of a homeless person. Restaurants are public spaces, and everyone has the right to be served unless they're disruptive. The couple's demand to remove her might be seen as inconsiderate towards her situation.\n\nIn terms of societal responsibility, maybe the person is in the wrong because they didn't consider the homeless woman's rights as a person. But if the restaurant management allowed her to stay, perhaps they should have taken steps to mitigate the situation, like offering a mask or moving her seat. However, the couple's decision to leave is their right, but the method of demanding her removal is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they treated the homeless woman poorly and demanded her removal based on her appearance and symptoms, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, there's a counterargument that they had the right to feel uncomfortable and leave. But the act of demanding her removal might make them the wrongdoers.\n"
