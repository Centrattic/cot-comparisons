Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person they found unclean. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author and their dad were at a new sushi restaurant, which was packed. They had a good experience with the food and the chef. Then a homeless woman enters, is visibly dirty, coughing, and they feel disgusted. The staff didn't offer her much service beyond a glass of water. The author and their dad demand she be removed, and when she's escorted out, they lose their appetite and leave without eating the free roll. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the core issue here is about treating others with dignity, especially those who are homeless or in vulnerable situations. The author's actions involve confronting the restaurant staff about the woman's presence, which could be seen as discriminatory. The woman was a customer, and the restaurant has a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a health or safety issue. The author's actions might have been based on prejudice against someone who is homeless, assuming she was a health risk based on appearance. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt physically ill due to the cough and smell, which is a valid personal reaction. However, the appropriate response would be to ask the staff to handle the situation, not to confront them directly or demand the woman's removal. The restaurant's responsibility is to manage their premises, and customers shouldn't dictate who they serve. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's request to remove a customer based on their appearance and health symptoms could be seen as discriminatory. 2) The restaurant didn't provide adequate service to the woman, which might indicate their own shortcomings in handling such situations. 3) The author's decision to leave might be a personal choice based on their discomfort, but the method of confronting the staff about the woman's presence is problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to balance personal discomfort with respect for others' rights. The author might not be the worst person for feeling uncomfortable, but their actions of demanding the woman's removal could be considered wrong. The restaurant's failure to provide proper service to her also plays a role, but the author's response still crosses a line by not respecting her as a customer.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions were discriminatory and they didn't respect the woman's right to be served. They should have addressed their own discomfort without interfering with the restaurant's responsibility to handle their customers.\n"
