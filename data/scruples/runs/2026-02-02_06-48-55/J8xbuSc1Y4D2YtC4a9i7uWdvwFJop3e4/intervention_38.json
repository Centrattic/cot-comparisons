Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is that the author went to a new sushi place with their dad. The restaurant was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless-looking woman walked in, sat next to them, had a terrible cough and was very dirty. The author and dad told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff did, and they left too, even though they were offered a free roll.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author might feel threatened by someone who appears very unwell and smells bad, which can be uncomfortable and maybe even a health concern. But on the other hand, everyone deserves to be served, regardless of their appearance. The restaurant didn't do anything wrong by serving her; they just gave water. The author's response was to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory or not respecting the rights of others. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions the woman's cough sounded like TB and her appearance was very dirty. That's a health and safety concern. If someone is visibly ill and possibly contagious, the restaurant might be responsible for ensuring the safety of their customers. However, the staff didn't act immediately, so the customers took matters into their own hands. \n\nHowever, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate against someone based on their homelessness. The restaurant's responsibility is to provide service to all unless there's a legitimate health risk. The author might have overstepped by demanding her removal without the staff addressing it first. Also, the woman wasn't disruptive, just present. The author's reaction could be seen as rude or intolerant, even if they felt uncomfortable. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal comfort and health concerns. If someone is coughing and smells bad, it's understandable to feel uneasy. However, the appropriate action might be to inform the staff again or leave voluntarily instead of demanding someone else's removal. The author's approach was confrontational and possibly aggressive towards the staff and the woman. \n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory, even if their health concerns were real. The answer might be A (wrong) because they didn't handle it respectfully, but some might argue it's B (not wrong) due to health risks. But given that the staff eventually removed her, maybe the restaurant had their own protocols, and the author shouldn't have taken charge. Yeah, leaning towards A.\n"
