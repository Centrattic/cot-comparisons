Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after a homeless person was served there. The story describes the situation where the family went to a new restaurant, which was packed. They were sitting at the sushi bar when a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, and started coughing. The woman was described as very dirty and smelly. The author and their dad demanded the staff remove her, which they did, and then the family left despite being offered a free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The restaurant was serving a homeless person, which is a basic human right to access food and services. However, the woman's health condition and appearance caused discomfort to the customers. The key points are: Did the author act inconsiderately towards the homeless person? Was demanding her removal a reasonable action?\n\nThe author's main concerns were health and hygiene. The woman had a severe cough, which could be a health risk, and she was very dirty. However, the restaurant workers didn't intervene until the customers complained. The question is whether the customers overstepped by demanding her removal. In public places, people have the right to be served, but if someone is visibly ill or poses a health hazard, the establishment should handle it. But the customers took immediate action instead of giving the restaurant time to address the issue themselves.\n\nAlso, the response of the restaurant\u2014apologizing and removing her\u2014suggests that maybe the staff felt the customer's concerns were valid. However, the act of publicly asking to remove a homeless person might be seen as discriminatory, even if the person was in a poor condition. The author's reaction might be based on fear of illness or discomfort, but treating someone as a threat solely based on appearance can be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their dad were customers paying for a meal, and their experience was ruined by discomfort. They didn't confront the woman directly but through the staff. The restaurant did comply, but the act of leaving after being given a free roll might be seen as harsh.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, helping the homeless is important, but so is protecting public health. The situation is a bit of a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they prioritized their own comfort over the rights of another person. However, the restaurant's lack of initial response might have contributed to the situation escalating.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's reaction was based on health concerns, but they could have been more patient with the restaurant's handling. Their immediate demand for removal and leaving might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their own discomfort over the rights of another person and possibly acted prematurely.\n"
