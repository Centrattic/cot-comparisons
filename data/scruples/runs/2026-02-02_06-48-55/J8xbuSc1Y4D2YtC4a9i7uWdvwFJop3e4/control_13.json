Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they served a homeless person who was coughing and smelled bad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a sketchy area, but the reviews were good. The person went with their dad, had a good experience initially. Then a homeless woman walks in, looks very dirty, coughs a lot, and smells bad. The couple told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff complied, but the couple left anyway.\n\nNow, evaluating if they're in the wrong. The key points are their actions and the reasoning. The woman was a customer, and the staff didn't ask her to leave. The couple demanded her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, the woman was coughing and smelled, which might be a health concern or make others uncomfortable. \n\nBut the law usually protects patrons and staff from discrimination based on appearance or homelessness. Restaurants can't just remove someone for being homeless unless they're causing a disturbance. The couple's actions might be seen as rude and excluding someone based on their socioeconomic status. Even if the woman was a health risk, the couple isn't in a position to demand she leave. The staff handled it by apologizing and giving a free roll, but the couple left, which might be their choice, but the initial demand could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether their actions were appropriate. Some might argue they had the right to request a safer environment, but others would say they overstepped by targeting someone vulnerable. The consensus might be that they're in the wrong because they didn't have the authority to demand someone else's removal based on appearance and health. So the answer is A.\n"
