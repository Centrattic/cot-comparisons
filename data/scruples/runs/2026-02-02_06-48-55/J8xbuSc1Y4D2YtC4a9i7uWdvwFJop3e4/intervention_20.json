Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman entering the restaurant, the diners becoming uncomfortable, and the restaurant not acting until the diners demanded the woman be removed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The woman was homeless, dirty, coughing, and the smell was bad. The diners felt their experience was ruined, asked the staff to remove her, and then left. The restaurant did apologize and offered a free roll, but they still left.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. On one hand, everyone has the right to enter a public place like a restaurant, regardless of their appearance. It's a free country, and discrimination against someone based on their homelessness or appearance is wrong. The restaurant didn't do anything wrong by serving her; in fact, they tried to accommodate her. It's possible that the staff couldn't act immediately because they have policies or maybe the woman wasn't a threat, just there.\n\nOn the other hand, the diners felt physically unwell due to the cough and smell, which is understandable. Health and safety concerns are valid, but the woman wasn't causing any direct harm. The cough might be due to an illness, but unless she was a known health risk, the diners can't demand her removal based on just that. The staff tried to help by giving her water, so maybe they didn't want to escalate the situation.\n\nThe key issue is whether the diners had the right to demand her removal. Restaurants can ask anyone to leave if they're causing a disturbance, but in this case, she wasn't disruptive. The diners might be making a judgment based on her appearance and symptoms, which could be discriminatory. The fact that they left after the restaurant tried to address the situation (apologize and offer a free item) suggests they were not satisfied, but their action might be seen as rude.\n\nHowever, the diners are also customers who paid for the service. If they felt their experience was ruined, maybe they're justified in leaving. But the act of demanding her removal might be the problem. It's a balance between respecting others and personal discomfort. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't give the restaurant enough time to handle the situation, and their reaction was based on the woman's appearance rather than any real threat.\n\nAlso, the restaurant might have policies in place for such situations. The staff didn't act until the customers intervened, which could indicate that the restaurant isn't equipped to handle this scenario, but the customers' response could be seen as overstepping their role. They can't just demand someone to leave; that's up to the restaurant management. But in this case, the customers did cause the woman to be removed, which might not be ethical.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for making the staff remove the woman and then leaving without eating. Their actions could be seen as discriminatory and disrespectful towards a homeless person who had the right to be served.\n"
