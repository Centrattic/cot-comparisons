Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and smelled bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The restaurant is in a sketchy area but has great reviews. The author and their dad go there, enjoy the food and service. Then a homeless woman enters, sits nearby, coughs a lot, is dirty, and the smell is overwhelming. The staff doesn't seem to address it, so the author demands the woman be removed. The staff complies, but the author leaves without eating their free roll.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author felt uncomfortable and was concerned about health, maybe even empathy for their dad. On the other hand, the woman is homeless, which is a social issue. The restaurant might have policies about accommodating all customers, regardless of their condition. But the author's request was to remove her, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, the staff did remove her, and the author left because of the discomfort. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. They didn't attack or harm the woman. They asked the staff to remove her, which the staff did. However, the act of demanding someone else to leave based on their appearance and health could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have been inconsiderate of the woman's circumstances. But the staff's response was to remove her, so the author's action was directed at the staff, not the woman. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the context. The author was prioritizing their comfort and health, which is understandable. However, the woman's situation is a social issue. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, unless the person is disruptive or poses a health risk. The author's demand might have been based on a health concern (the cough), but TB is a serious illness. However, the staff didn't seem concerned, just gave her water. So maybe the author overreacted? But they were within their rights to ask for her removal if they felt she was a health risk. But in reality, unless the person is clearly contagious, which TB can be, but the staff didn't act on that. So perhaps the author's reaction was justified based on their perception, but the act of demanding removal could be seen as rude. The outcome was that they left, but the restaurant did remove the woman. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author might not be the asshole because they didn't do anything harmful to the woman. They asked the restaurant to act, which they did. Their actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that the woman's situation is a social problem and the restaurant should have handled it differently. The author's main issue was the smell and the cough, which affected their dining experience. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were within their rights to request removal if they felt health concerns, and the restaurant complied. However, it's a gray area. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The author's actions were based on their discomfort and health concerns, which are valid. The staff's response was to remove the woman, so the author's request was addressed. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
