Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after a homeless person was served there. The situation involves the author and their dad dining at a new sushi restaurant, which was packed. They were seated at the sushi bar, enjoyed the food, but then a homeless woman walked in, looked disheveled, coughed a lot, and smelled bad. The staff didn't do anything except give her water, so the author and dad demanded she be removed. The staff complied, but they still left, didn't eat the free roll, and are now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are the treatment of the homeless woman and the actions of the author. The woman was being served at the restaurant, which is a public space. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable due to her appearance and health symptoms, leading them to confront the staff. The staff didn't initially intervene, which might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all people, and they can't discriminate based on appearance or homelessness unless there's a legitimate health and safety issue.\n\nThe author's actions involve demanding her removal without clear evidence of a threat. While it's understandable to feel unwell from a persistent cough, that alone isn't a reason to expel someone from a public place. The smell and appearance, while unpleasant, don't justify such a response. The restaurant might have had policies in place, but the guests taking direct action to remove her could be seen as overstepping. They had the option to ask the staff to address the situation rather than making the demand themselves, which could be perceived as aggressive or discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for their health and comfort is valid, especially if someone is coughing a lot, which could be contagious. However, the appropriate response would be to inform the staff and let them handle it according to their protocols. The fact that the staff eventually removed her suggests they might have had reasons, but the author's immediate confrontation might have been harsh. Leaving after being given a free roll might be a reasonable choice if they felt uncomfortable, but the initial demand to remove her could be seen as the main issue.\n\nConsidering societal norms and public accommodation laws, businesses should serve everyone unless there's a specific policy violation. Homeless individuals are still entitled to service unless they pose a direct threat. The author's actions could be viewed as discriminatory, even if their intentions were based on personal discomfort. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for demanding her removal without proper cause.\n"
