Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is whether they were right to leave the restaurant because the staff was serving a homeless person. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person and their dad went to a new sushi restaurant that was in a sketchy area. They had a good experience, but then a homeless woman came in, looked very dirty, coughed a lot, and the smell was bad. The staff didn't seem to do much except give her water. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, and when she was, they left without eating the free roll. Now, they're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether confronting the staff and leaving was justified. Let's break down the factors. \n\nHomelessness is a significant social issue. Many people who are homeless may not have access to regular showers or medical care, so their appearance might be due to circumstances beyond their control. The woman's cough could be due to a health issue, but the author assumed she was sick, maybe with TB. That's a big assumption. Also, the smell could be from lack of hygiene, but again, it's not the restaurant's fault if they're serving people in need.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt uncomfortable and was worried about health. The restaurant is a public space, and while they have a duty to maintain hygiene, they might also have a policy of serving all customers, including those in need. However, if a customer is making others uncomfortable or poses a health risk (like a contagious illness), the restaurant might have the right to ask them to leave, but did the staff have the authority to do that?\n\nThe author and their dad demanded the woman's removal, which could be seen as overstepping. Restaurants usually handle such situations themselves. If the staff didn't act before, maybe they had a reason. Maybe the woman was a regular or they were trying to accommodate her. By confronting the staff directly, the author might have put them in a difficult position. \n\nAlso, the author left abruptly, took the free roll, but didn't eat it. That could be seen as being rude or not giving the restaurant a chance to resolve it. The free roll was an apology, but the authors didn't even try to eat it. That might indicate they were more focused on their own discomfort than the restaurant's response.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility. The authors prioritized their own experience and health concerns over the restaurant's role in serving everyone. While it's understandable to care about health, the method of confrontation might have been inappropriate. The restaurant might have policies in place, and the authors' actions could be seen as interfering in how the business operates.\n\nHowever, if the woman was actually a health risk, then it's a different scenario. But the story doesn't confirm that she was contagious. The author's assumption about TB might be unfounded. So, perhaps the authors acted on an assumption rather than fact, which is problematic.\n\nIn summary, the authors might be in the wrong because they took matters into their own hands, possibly based on assumptions, and didn't allow the restaurant to handle the situation as they would. They also left without giving the restaurant a chance to address their concerns beyond the initial apology. However, their discomfort is real, so it's a nuanced situation. But given the information, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong).\n"
