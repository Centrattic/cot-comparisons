Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they served a homeless person. Hmm. The situation: the user went to a new sushi place with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. The woman came in, looked dirty, coughed a lot, and they asked the staff to remove her. The staff did, and they left without finishing the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's actions. They didn't like the appearance or the cough of the woman, which led them to demand she be removed. Then they left the restaurant. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and restaurants sometimes face challenges with serving homeless individuals due to various reasons like hygiene, but it's also about treating everyone with dignity. The user's reasoning seems to be health concerns because of the cough and smell. However, the staff didn't act immediately, so the customers took it upon themselves to request her removal.\n\nBut is this justified? The user's health concern might be a valid concern if the cough is a sign of contagious illness. However, it's possible they jumped to conclusions. Also, by their own account, the staff eventually removed her after the customers confronted them. So maybe the staff didn't have the resources or policies in place to handle such situations, and the customers felt they had to act.\n\nBut demanding someone to be removed because of their appearance and leaving could be seen as discriminatory. The user's main reason was the health risk, but without knowing the actual health status, they might be making assumptions. The fact that they left and didn't consume the free roll shows they felt uncomfortable, but the act of forcing the removal might not be appropriate. Restaurants should handle such situations, but customers shouldn't police others. So maybe the user is in the wrong for taking matters into their own hands instead of just leaving themselves or not reacting. Alternatively, if the staff didn't act, maybe the user had a right to ask. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering the impact on the homeless woman and the potential for discrimination, the user might be at fault. So AITA-wise, the answer might be A.\n"
