Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after a homeless person was served there. The situation involves a homeless woman with a bad cough and poor hygiene, which made the author and their dad uncomfortable enough to demand she be removed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant is a public space, and everyone has the right to be served, regardless of their appearance or situation. Homeless individuals shouldn't be discriminated against. However, the woman in question had a severe cough and a strong odor, which might pose health or safety concerns. But the restaurant didn't seem to address the situation until the authors intervened. \n\nThe authors' actions: they confronted the staff and demanded the woman's removal. The staff then apologized and escorted her out. The authors left the restaurant feeling uncomfortable. The core issue here is whether the authors' demand to remove the woman was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the authors had the right to feel uncomfortable, and if the woman's condition was a health hazard, the restaurant should address it. But on the other hand, the woman might not have been a threat. The authors made assumptions about her health based on her cough and appearance. The restaurant's initial inaction could be a problem, but the authors' response might be seen as discriminatory. \n\nAlso, the restaurant gave them a free roll as a gesture of apology, but they didn't eat it. The question is whether their actions were respectful or if they were being rude. The key points are discrimination, public accommodation laws, and the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't refuse service based on someone's homelessness. The authors might be considered in the wrong for demanding the woman's removal, as it's a form of discrimination. However, if the woman was a health risk, that might justify the request. But the authors didn't provide evidence that she was actually ill, just their perception. \n\nSo, the answer likely is that the authors are in the wrong (A) because they discriminated against the homeless woman based on appearance and assumed she was a health risk without evidence.\n"
