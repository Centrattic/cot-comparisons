Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is wrong here. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were served near a homeless person who was coughing and looked very dirty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their actions. They went to a restaurant, noticed a homeless woman who was coughing and appeared unclean, and demanded she be removed. When that happened, they still left and didn't eat the free food offered. The question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, everyone has the right to be in a public space, including restaurants. Homeless individuals shouldn't be discriminated against. The person might be showing bias or lack of empathy by demanding she leave. The restaurant didn't initially remove her, so maybe they have a policy of serving all customers. The person's reaction could be seen as rude and unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might be concerned about their health and safety. The woman was coughing a lot, which could be contagious, and she had a bad smell. People might be worried about getting sick, especially if they're in close proximity at a sushi bar. The request to remove her isn't illegal, and if the restaurant complies, their responsibility is to their customers. The person might feel they have the right to request their safety.\n\nBut wait, the restaurant's policy is to serve everyone. If they allowed a homeless person in, they should handle it without discrimination. The person asking to remove her might be contributing to stigma against homeless individuals. Even if the woman was sick, the restaurant should handle it appropriately without forcing her out. The act of demanding she leave could be considered discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the person left without eating the free food. That might be seen as being rude or not respecting the restaurant's effort to compensate them. The restaurant offered an apology and a free roll, but they still left, which could be seen as unnecessary.\n\nHowever, if the person felt genuinely uncomfortable and unsafe, maybe their reaction is understandable. But it's important to balance individual rights against the rights of others. The key here is whether their request was justified. If the woman was a health hazard, the restaurant should address it, but demanding her removal could be seen as rude. The person's health concerns are valid, but their approach might have been inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally not acceptable to demand that someone else leave a public place unless they are causing a disturbance. The woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond her appearance and coughing. If the coughing was severe, maybe the restaurant should have addressed it, but the customers shouldn't be the ones to make that demand.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person's action of demanding the woman's removal and then leaving might be considered inconsiderate and discriminatory. They should have let the restaurant handle the situation without intervening directly. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of health concerns. However, the main issue is the act of demanding her removal, which is more about being inconsiderate towards others. So the answer is A, they are in the wrong.\n"
