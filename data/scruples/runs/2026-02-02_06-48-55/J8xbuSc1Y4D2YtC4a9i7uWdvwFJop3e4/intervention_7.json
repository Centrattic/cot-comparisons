Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether they were justified in leaving the restaurant after a homeless woman was served there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their dad went to a new restaurant. It was crowded, and they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless-looking woman came in, started coughing, was dirty, and the smell was bad. They told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff took her out, they got a free roll but left anyway.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, A for yes, B for no.\n\nI should consider several angles. The woman was homeless, which is a vulnerable group. The restaurant served her, which is part of their policy. The author and his dad demanded her removal. Was that acceptable? \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant is a public place, and serving anyone is their right. The woman was there, and the customers were making a judgment based on her appearance and symptoms. The cough could be due to various reasons, not necessarily contagious. Plus, the smell and appearance might be due to circumstances beyond her control. The staff didn't intervene until the customers asked, which might indicate some issues with the restaurant's handling of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the customers felt uncomfortable and were concerned about health. The cough was alarming, and the smell was off-putting. They might have felt their dining experience was ruined. However, their action was to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory or inconsiderate. \n\nLegally, restaurants can't discriminate based on appearance, but the customers didn't have a health code violation to cite. Their request might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual health risk. The restaurant did offer an apology and a free roll, but the customers left anyway, which could be seen as holding the restaurant accountable for their mistake or as being unreasonable.\n\nMoral perspective: The customers judged someone based on appearance and symptoms without knowing her situation. The homeless woman might have had nowhere else to go. The action could be seen as inconsiderate towards her and the restaurant's policy of serving all customers. However, the customers also felt they had a right to a pleasant dining experience. \n\nThe key points are: Did the customers have the right to demand her removal? Was their action discriminatory? Was the restaurant in the wrong for serving her? The customers' request might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the woman wasn't violating any rules. The smell and cough could be due to factors beyond the restaurant's control. The customers' reaction might be a reasonable response to their discomfort, but it's also possible they overreacted.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the customers were being judgmental, while others might think they were justified if they felt their health was at risk. However, the cough alone isn't necessarily a health risk, and the smell could be subjective. The restaurant's handling of the situation also matters\u2014staff didn't act until asked, which might reflect poorly on their management.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory, especially if the woman wasn't a threat. Therefore, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong). However, some might argue that personal comfort is valid. But given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
