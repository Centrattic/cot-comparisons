Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The story is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both angles. The author went to a restaurant with their dad, the place was packed. They were enjoying the food and the service. Then a homeless woman enters, looks disheveled, coughs a lot, smells bad. The author and their dad demand she be removed. The restaurant complies, but the authors leave, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nNow, the key points here are the actions of the author. They felt uncomfortable because of the woman's appearance, coughing, and smell. They confronted the staff, leading to her removal. The question is whether this action was justified or if the authors are the ones in the wrong.\n\nHomelessness is a complex social issue. Restaurants are public places and should be accessible to everyone. However, individuals have the right to request removal of someone who is making them uncomfortable, but there might be ethical considerations. The woman was already being served water, so the staff didn't act on initial observation. The authors intervened, possibly out of health concerns (the coughing) or discomfort. But is that a valid reason?\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's debatable. While personal comfort is a factor, the authors made a decision that affected another person's access to a service. However, the woman's appearance and health symptoms might pose a concern, especially regarding public health. Yet, the restaurant's role is to serve all patrons, and the staff might have protocols for such situations.\n\nThe authors' actions could be seen as discriminatory if they targeted the woman solely because she's homeless. On the other hand, if the coughing was genuinely concerning for health reasons, their reaction might be more understandable.\n\nThe answer hinges on balancing individual rights and the restaurant's responsibility. The authors might be considered in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort over the woman's right to be served. However, if the coughing was a legitimate health hazard, their concern could be justified. But the narrative seems to focus more on their discomfort rather than a clear health violation.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely that the authors are in the wrong, as their actions could be seen as discriminatory and not based on actual harm. So, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) is probably correct.\n"
