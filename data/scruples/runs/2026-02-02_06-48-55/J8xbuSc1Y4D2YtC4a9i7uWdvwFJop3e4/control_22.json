Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because a homeless person was being served there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. A woman walked in, looked homeless and very dirty, and had a severe cough. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The person and their dad told the restaurant to remove her or they'd leave. The staff removed her, and then they left, not eating the free roll given as an apology.\n\nThe key points here are: the woman was homeless, visibly unclean, had a severe cough, and the staff didn't intervene. The person left because of health and cleanliness concerns, possibly fearing illness from the cough and smell.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Restaurants are public spaces and should serve everyone. However, if a customer poses a direct threat to others' health (like an infectious disease), the restaurant has a responsibility to address that. The woman's cough sounds serious, possibly contagious. The staff didn't act initially, but the customer took initiative. \n\nBut wait, the customer's approach was to demand her removal. Was that right? If the staff didn't act first, maybe the customer had a reason to be concerned. However, the customer could have asked staff to check on the woman first instead of making an ultimatum. Also, the woman might not have been a health risk; maybe she was seeking help. \n\nThe restaurant's duty is to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason to ask someone to leave. If the restaurant didn't act, the customer might have felt justified in leaving due to discomfort and fear. However, demanding removal could be seen as discriminatory. But if the staff didn't act, maybe the customer had a right to leave.\n\nAnother angle: the woman was being served, which is a positive. The staff's inaction might be the issue. The customer's reaction was based on appearance and symptoms, which could be stereotyping. However, the smell and cough were real, so health concerns are valid.\n\nEthically, it's a grey area. The customer left due to health fears, but the restaurant is a public place. The staff's lack of action might be the real problem here. The customer could have left without demanding her removal. By making the demand, they might be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the circumstances, maybe they were within their right to prioritize their health.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The customer's actions might be seen as necessary for their own well-being, but the method of demanding removal could be problematic. The answer depends on whether the health threat was real or perceived. If the woman was truly a health risk, the staff should have acted. If it was a misunderstanding, the customer might be at fault.\n"
