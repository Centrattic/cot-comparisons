Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person left a restaurant because they were serving a homeless woman who was coughing and looked dirty. They confronted the restaurant, got her removed, and then left without eating the free roll. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant is in a sketchy area but has great reviews. The customer is a sushi fan and wanted to check it out. The homeless woman enters, looks unwell, coughs a lot, and the customer demands she be removed. The restaurant complies, but the customer leaves anyway.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the customer was wrong for leaving because the restaurant was serving someone homeless. Homelessness is a social issue, and restaurants serving all customers, including those in need, is generally considered right. However, the customer's actions might be seen as discriminatory if they were leaving solely because of the person's appearance and health condition. But there's also the aspect of health concerns\u2014coughing heavily could be a hygiene issue, especially in a food establishment. \n\nHowever, the restaurant did serve her water and didn't act on the initial complaint until the customers demanded removal. The customer might argue health fears, but others might say they were being judgmental and insensitive. The act of leaving after getting the person removed could be seen as abandoning the situation, not supporting the restaurant's service to all.\n\nBut then, the restaurant could be responsible for ensuring a safe environment. If the person was indeed ill, maybe the restaurant should have taken precautions. However, the customer's immediate reaction was to demand removal, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the customer's health concerns versus the principle of serving everyone regardless of appearance. The restaurant's responsibility to all patrons. The action of demanding someone to be removed based on appearance and coughing could be seen as discriminatory, even if the customer felt uncomfortable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the restaurant to handle the situation and for leaving because of the presence of a homeless person.\n"
