Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about leaving a restaurant because they served a homeless person who was coughing and looked dirty. The person felt grossed out and made the restaurant remove her, then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. The main question is whether the author acted appropriately by demanding the staff to remove the homeless woman. The restaurant is a public place, and serving anyone is part of their policy. However, the woman was coughing and looked unclean, which the author found offensive.\n\nOn one hand, the author and their dad felt uncomfortable and were concerned about health. The cough might be a legitimate health concern, especially if it sounds like a serious illness. On the other hand, the author is making a judgment based on appearance and health status. The restaurant didn't act on the woman's condition before, so the staff didn't remove her. The author's demand might have been based on their discomfort rather than the restaurant's policy.\n\nAlso, the restaurant offered an apology and a free roll, but they left anyway. That shows they didn't accept the apology, which could be seen as holding the restaurant accountable for their own discomfort. But is it right to force the removal of a patron based on their appearance? Homeless individuals often face discrimination, and asking them to leave because they look unclean could be considered prejudice.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman, prioritizing their own comfort over her right to be served. However, if the cough was a real health hazard, that's a different scenario. But the story doesn't mention any actual illness being confirmed, just the author's perception.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer might depend on societal norms. Some might argue that the author is within their rights to leave a place if they're uncomfortable, while others might think they were rude for requesting the woman's removal. The restaurant's handling of the situation is also a factor\u2014since they did remove her after the author's demand, maybe they should have addressed it earlier if they had policies against such situations.\n\nSo, the author's wrongness might lie in making the restaurant remove someone based on their appearance and health concerns without evidence, which could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
