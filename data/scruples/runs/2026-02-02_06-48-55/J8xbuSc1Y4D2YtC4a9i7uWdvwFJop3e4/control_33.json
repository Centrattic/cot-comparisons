Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was there. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the person went to a restaurant with their dad. The restaurant was busy, and they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless woman walked in, looked very dirty, and had a terrible cough. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, and when she was, they left because they lost their appetite despite getting a free roll.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's think about the arguments. On one side, the author might feel they have a right to a comfortable dining experience. If someone is visibly unwell and causing discomfort, maybe they felt justified in asking for her removal. Restaurants can have policies about health and safety, but maybe they didn't act in this case. Also, the smell and coughing could be a health concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is homeless and likely in a vulnerable situation. The staff didn't intervene, so the customers stepped in. But is it the customers' responsibility to enforce such things? Also, the author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory against homeless people, which is a sensitive issue. They might not have considered that the woman might not have access to healthcare or hygiene services. The fact that they left after being offered a free roll might indicate they were more concerned about their own discomfort than the woman's well-being.\n\nThe line between protecting oneself and being inconsiderate is thin. While health concerns are valid, the reaction might be seen as overreaching. Restaurants are public spaces, and customers should ideally handle such situations with staff instead of demanding ejection. The staff didn't act initially, so the customers took matters into their own hands. That could be problematic because it's not their role to decide who is allowed in a public space.\n\nIn terms of societal perspective, there's a growing awareness about homelessness and the need for compassion. Judging someone based on appearance and health without knowing their situation might be unfair. The author's actions could be viewed as contributing to stigma against homeless individuals. However, it's also understandable to want a safe and clean environment. But the way they handled it\u2014demanding removal immediately\u2014might be the issue.\n\nI think the key points are the assumption of health risk without evidence, the immediate demand to remove the woman, and the lack of empathy. The staff's inaction is also a factor, as they should have addressed any real health concerns. So the author might be in the wrong for not giving the staff a chance to handle it properly and for reacting based on appearance rather than actual harm.\n"
