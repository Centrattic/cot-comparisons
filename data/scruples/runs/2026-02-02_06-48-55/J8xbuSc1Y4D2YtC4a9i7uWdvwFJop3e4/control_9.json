Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless-looking woman came in and sat next to them. She had a bad cough, looked very dirty, and the smell was bad. The restaurant didn't do anything about it, so the person and their dad told the staff they'd leave unless the woman was removed. The staff did remove her, they got a free roll, but they still left.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about discrimination, ethics, and restaurant policies. \n\nHomeless individuals often face stigma and mistreatment. Restaurants, especially in less affluent areas, might serve a diverse clientele. By demanding the homeless woman's removal, the author and their dad might be seen as contributing to that mistreatment. The staff didn't initially act, perhaps due to policy or compassion, but the customers forced their hand. That could be problematic because it's not the customer's place to dictate how the restaurant handles its patrons, especially those in need. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of health concerns. The woman was coughing intensely, which could be a health risk. In some places, public health laws might require removing someone who's ill if they pose a risk. But the author's reaction was based on the appearance of illness rather than a confirmed diagnosis. Also, the smell might be a concern, but that's part of homelessness and personal hygiene struggles, not necessarily a public health issue unless it's infectious. \n\nThe author left because they were uncomfortable, not necessarily because there was a real health hazard. That could be seen as discriminatory or classist. Restaurants should serve all people, regardless of their appearance or social status. By pressuring the staff to remove the woman, the author might be violating the restaurant's right to serve whom they choose, unless there's a specific health and safety violation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the staff didn't act initially, maybe they had a policy to accommodate all customers, but the author's insistence forced a different action. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of the homeless person's rights and dignity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because their demand was based on appearance and discomfort rather than a legitimate health threat. They didn't give the restaurant time to handle it, and their action contributed to a negative experience for the homeless woman. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
