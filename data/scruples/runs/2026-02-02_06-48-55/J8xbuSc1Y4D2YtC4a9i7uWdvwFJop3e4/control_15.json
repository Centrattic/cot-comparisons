Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves the person and their dad going to a new sushi place. They found the restaurant packed and were at the bar. Then a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough came in, the staff didn't do anything, and they demanded she be removed. The staff complied, but they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are the treatment of the homeless woman, the health concerns, and the restaurant's responsibility. The woman was homeless, which implies she might be facing societal challenges. The author felt that her presence was unhygienic due to the cough and smell, leading them to demand her removal. But is it right to ask a restaurant to remove a customer based on appearance and health concerns?\n\nFrom a public health perspective, if someone is visibly ill, there might be reasons to be cautious, but the restaurant staff didn't take action initially. The author and their dad took it upon themselves to demand her removal. However, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate against someone based on their appearance or homelessness. Restaurants are public spaces and can't just remove patrons without cause. Unless the person was actually causing harm, like threatening others or breaking rules, the staff might not have grounds to eject them.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as discriminatory. They judged the woman based on her appearance and health, which are protected characteristics. The smell and cough could be due to circumstances beyond her control. The fact that the staff didn't act might be because they can't just kick someone out for being homeless or looking disheveled. The author's demand to remove her could be considered prejudiced against the homeless.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about health is understandable. If someone is coughing violently, it's natural to worry about contagious diseases. However, the appropriate action would be to inform the staff and ask them to handle it according to health protocols, not to demand the person's removal themselves. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason to ask someone to leave, like disruptive behavior.\n\nAlso, the response from the restaurant was to apologize and give a free roll. The author left without eating it, which might indicate that they felt uncomfortable, but that's their choice. However, the act of demanding her removal without the restaurant's initiative could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which isn't the restaurant's policy. The staff's inaction might be due to legal or ethical guidelines against discrimination.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, there's a growing awareness about treating homeless individuals with dignity. Public spaces should be accessible to everyone, and assuming someone is a health risk just because they're homeless is a harmful stereotype. The author's actions, while perhaps driven by self-preservation, could be viewed as contributing to the marginalization of homeless people.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they discriminated against the homeless woman based on her appearance and health, which could be considered prejudiced. The appropriate step would have been to ask the staff to handle the situation, perhaps by providing cleaning supplies or addressing health concerns, rather than demanding her removal.\n"
