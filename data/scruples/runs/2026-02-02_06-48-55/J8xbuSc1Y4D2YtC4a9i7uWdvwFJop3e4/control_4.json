Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person with a cough was served there. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The restaurant was serving a homeless woman who looked very dirty and had a bad cough. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable, asked the staff to remove her, and then left without eating the free roll offered. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nNow, considering different angles. On one hand, the customers felt health concerns due to the woman's cough and smell. They might have felt their safety or comfort was compromised. Also, they did ask the staff to remove her before leaving, which could be seen as giving the restaurant a chance to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant chose to serve that customer, and the customers' reaction might be seen as discriminatory. The homeless person might have a right to service regardless of appearance. The cough could be a health concern, but maybe the staff handled it differently. Also, the customers didn't give the restaurant a chance to address their concerns before leaving, which could be seen as abrupt.\n\nHealth and safety are valid concerns. If the woman was indeed sick, maybe the restaurant didn't take proper precautions. But is the customer allowed to demand removal of a patron just based on appearance and coughing? That might depend on local laws and the restaurant's policies. If there's no immediate health risk, it could be seen as the customers overreacting.\n\nAlso, the social responsibility aspect: should people not judge others based on appearance? The customers might have acted out of fear or discomfort, which is understandable, but treating someone poorly because they're homeless is a societal issue. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason to remove someone (like causing harm).\n\nThe fact that the sushi chef apologized and gave a free roll shows they acknowledged the customers' discomfort, but maybe the action of removing the woman was necessary for the customers' peace of mind. However, the customers leaving without eating might be seen as holding a grudge or overreacting to the situation.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, customers have some rights, but they also have responsibilities. Demanding someone else to leave might be crossing a line. The restaurant might have policies against that, so the customers' behavior could be considered rude or discriminatory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they based their actions on the appearance and health of another customer, possibly discriminating against her. However, there's a counterargument that health concerns are valid. But in public places, people have the right to be there unless violating rules. The customers didn't have the authority to demand her removal. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
