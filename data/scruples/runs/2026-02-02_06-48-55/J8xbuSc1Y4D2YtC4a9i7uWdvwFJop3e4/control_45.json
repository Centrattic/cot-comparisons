Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. The situation involves the person and their dad going to a new sushi place. They were at the bar, enjoying the food, when a homeless woman with a bad cough and dirty appearance came in. The staff didn't intervene, so they demanded she be removed. When she was taken out, they left because they lost their appetite, even though the chef offered a free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The restaurant is a public space, and serving anyone is part of their policy, especially if they're not causing immediate harm. But the woman's health might be a concern. However, the patrons aren't in a position to demand someone be removed just because of appearance or coughing unless there's a health and safety violation. The question is whether the patrons had the right to ask the staff to remove her. Restaurants can ask someone to leave if they're a threat or breaking rules, but the patrons aren't the ones who can decide that. They can ask the staff, but if the staff didn't act, maybe the patrons were within their rights to leave. But was it right to demand her removal? The woman might have a right to be served, especially if she's paying. The smell and coughing could be health concerns, but unless there's an actual health risk (like contagious disease), it's subjective. The patrons might be acting on prejudice, seeing her as a threat based on her appearance. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't have the authority to demand her removal, and the restaurant's policy should have been followed. But maybe the staff did their job by giving her water and not intervening, so the patrons felt uncomfortable and left. It's a gray area. The key points are: Did the woman pose a real threat? Were the patrons justified in their request? Is it the restaurant's responsibility to handle such situations? The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory if the woman wasn't actually a health risk. So, the answer could be A (they're in the wrong) for acting on their assumptions rather than trusting the staff to handle it. Alternatively, B if they felt genuinely threatened. But I think the consensus here is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't have the right to demand the woman's removal based on her appearance and coughing without clear evidence of a health risk.\n"
