Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: they went to a restaurant, and while there, a homeless person comes in and sits nearby. The person's appearance and coughing made them uncomfortable. They asked the restaurant to remove her, which they did, and then the author and their dad left without eating their free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the restaurant. If the restaurant allows people to eat there, regardless of their social status or appearance, then the staff should handle such situations. The staff did apologize and remove the woman, so maybe they have policies in place. The author's action was to demand her removal, which the restaurant then did. But was that the right thing to do?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, everyone should be treated with dignity and allowed to access public services, including restaurants. However, if the person was indeed a health hazard\u2014like coughing violently and smelling terrible\u2014that might be a different case. But the author's account says the restaurant didn't do anything except give her water. The staff might have had their own reasons for not acting sooner. \n\nThe author's demand to remove her could be seen as being judgmental and possibly discriminatory. On the other hand, if the person was genuinely making them feel physically ill, maybe they had a right to leave. But demanding the person be removed and then leaving might be seen as rude or intolerant. \n\nAlso, the restaurant gave a free roll as an apology, but the author didn't eat it. Maybe the restaurant tried to make amends, but the author still left. Was the author's reaction proportionate to the situation? It's a balance between personal comfort and respecting others' rights to be in a public space. \n\nIn some places, homeless individuals do have the right to enter businesses unless they are causing a disturbance. The woman's coughing might be perceived as disturbing, but unless it's confirmed that she's a health risk, it's not the right to demand her removal. The author's action could be seen as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless people. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the restaurant to handle the situation on their own terms and for being intolerant towards someone who was in a vulnerable position. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
