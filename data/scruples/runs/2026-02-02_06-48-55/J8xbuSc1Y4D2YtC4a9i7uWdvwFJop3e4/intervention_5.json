Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person describes a woman who was very dirty and coughing. They confronted the restaurant staff to have her removed, which led to her being escorted out. Then they left without eating the free roll offered. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's a fair assessment.\n\nHomelessness is a complex social issue. Restaurants are public spaces and typically serve everyone regardless of their circumstances. The staff didn't ask her to leave initially, which suggests they were following their policy of serving all customers. The author and their dad demanded her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory. Judging someone by their appearance and health, especially coughing, might be based on unfounded assumptions about their health status. \n\nHowever, the smell and coughing could cause discomfort, but that doesn't justify requesting someone to be removed. The restaurant's role is to provide service to all, and as customers, the author might have overstepped by demanding her removal. They could have chosen to leave themselves if they were uncomfortable, rather than expecting the restaurant to take action. \n\nOn the other hand, the person's reaction might stem from legitimate discomfort, but the way they handled it was problematic. The key issue here is the assumption that the homeless woman was a threat or unwelcome, which is a common bias. The restaurant's apology and offering a free roll might indicate they felt guilty about how the situation was handled, but the initial action of the author was inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were based on prejudice against a homeless individual, which is wrong. They should have respected the restaurant's policy and perhaps left themselves without demanding the staff to remove someone else. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
