Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them leaving a restaurant because a homeless woman was being served there. They felt uncomfortable due to her appearance, cough, and smell, and confronted the staff, leading to her removal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant was packed, and the woman was a customer. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, which the staff did. The author then left without eating the complimentary roll. \n\nEthically, the author's actions might be seen as discriminatory. The woman was a customer, and as a business, the restaurant has a right to serve anyone unless there's a safety issue. The author's judgment based on her appearance and health could be considered prejudiced. However, the author might argue that they were concerned about health risks, but that's a stretch unless the woman was clearly contagious. \n\nOn the other hand, their right to leave a business because of personal discomfort is a factor. However, the way they handled it\u2014demanding her removal rather than politely asking to be seated elsewhere\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's actions could be viewed as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless individuals. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They should have considered the woman's rights as a customer and handled their discomfort differently. However, there's a nuance. The smell and cough might be health concerns, but those are subjective. Still, the act of forcing the restaurant to remove her is problematic. So, A is the correct choice.\n"
