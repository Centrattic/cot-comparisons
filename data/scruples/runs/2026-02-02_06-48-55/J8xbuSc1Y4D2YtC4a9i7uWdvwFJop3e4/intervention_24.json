Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The restaurant was serving someone who was homeless, visibly unclean, and coughing violently. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable and threatened, leading them to demand the staff remove the person. The staff complied, but the couple still left. \n\nNow, the key points here. The restaurant is a public place, and serving all customers is their right. However, the presence of a homeless person might be a sensitive issue. The author's reaction is based on fear of illness and discomfort. \n\nBut here's the thing: the restaurant didn't ask the homeless woman to leave. They only did so because the customers demanded it. So, the author is essentially pressuring the establishment to discriminate against someone else. That can be seen as wrong because it's using their customer power to exclude someone else, which is a form of bullying.\n\nAlso, the author left the restaurant even after the situation was addressed. The free roll and apology were given, but they still chose to leave, which might suggest they were more upset about the presence of the woman than the service. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about health and safety is understandable. The cough could be a real health concern, and the smell and appearance might be off-putting. However, the real issue is whether they have the right to demand someone else to be removed from a public space. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's important to consider that homeless individuals are entitled to the same services as anyone else. The author's actions might prevent the restaurant from serving such individuals in the future, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake was using their position as a customer to demand the removal of another customer, which is not their place. They could have handled the situation differently, like asking for a seat change or using a mask if they were concerned about the cough. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
