Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a restaurant, which was in a sketchy area but had good reviews. They were at the sushi bar with their dad when a homeless woman came in. She was visibly dirty, coughing, and had a bad smell. The author and dad told the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, but they can ask someone to leave if they're causing a disturbance or a health issue. The woman's cough could be a health concern, especially in a food establishment. However, the author and dad didn't immediately leave; they gave the staff a chance to address it. The staff did remove her, but the author still left. \n\nThe key points are whether the woman was a health hazard. The cough resembling TB is a strong concern, but without medical confirmation, it's an assumption. The smell and appearance might have been due to homelessness, which is a social issue. The restaurant allowed her to enter, so maybe they have a policy of serving everyone. The author's reaction is understandable due to fear of illness, but it's also a matter of treating all people with dignity. \n\nHowever, the restaurant staff did act on their request. The author might be in the wrong if they judged the woman without knowing her situation. But they also have the right to feel uncomfortable and leave. It's a tough call. Some might say the author was reasonable in protecting their health, while others might think they were insensitive. But given the health concerns and the staff's response, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
