Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. The person is a sushi fan and went to a new restaurant with their dad. When a homeless woman with a bad cough came in, they told the staff to remove her, and when they did, the family left without eating the free roll given.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was homeless, visibly unclean, and had a severe cough. The family felt uncomfortable and threatened their departure unless she was removed. The staff didn't seem to intervene until asked, which might be a point of contention.\n\nOn one hand, the family's concern about health and safety could be valid. If someone is coughing heavily and has a strong smell, it's natural to worry about illness and hygiene. However, the restaurant is a public place, and serving homeless people isn't against any rules. The family's actions might be seen as discriminatory, as they were asking staff to remove a customer based on her appearance and condition.\n\nBut wait, the family didn't know she was homeless initially. They were reacting to her health and hygiene, which they perceived as a threat. However, their assumption about her condition could be based on stereotypes. Also, leaving because of someone else's presence might be seen as selfish, especially since the staff tried to accommodate them with an apology and a free roll.\n\nHomeless individuals often face stigma and discrimination. By demanding her removal, the family might be contributing to that stigma. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, and the family's interference in that could be problematic.\n\nHowever, from the family's perspective, they were protecting their health and comfort. But in a public setting, people have to tolerate others to some extent. The line here is between legitimate health concerns and intolerance towards others' circumstances.\n\nI think the key points are: was their action discriminatory, did they have a right to ask for her removal, and was their reaction proportionate? The answer likely leans towards the family being in the wrong because they judged the woman based on appearance and forced the staff to remove her, which could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. Even if the staff didn't object initially, the family's threat to leave pressured them into compliance.\n"
