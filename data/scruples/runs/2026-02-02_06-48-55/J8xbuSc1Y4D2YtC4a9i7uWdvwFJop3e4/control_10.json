Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, which was serving a homeless woman who was very dirty and coughing a lot. The author and their dad demanded that the restaurant remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should be accessible to everyone, including homeless individuals. Serving them is part of providing service to all patrons. The author's reaction might be seen as discriminatory or rude, as they were the ones who asked for the woman to be removed. That's a clear sign of being inconsiderate towards someone in need.\n\nBut then, there's the health and safety concern. The woman was coughing, which the author perceived as potentially contagious. The smell and appearance might have made the dining experience unpleasant. The restaurant's responsibility is to ensure the well-being of their customers. If the woman was a health risk, maybe the restaurant should have addressed it. But the author's immediate reaction was to confront the staff, leading to her being escorted out. That shows a lack of patience and empathy.\n\nAlso, the restaurant didn't take any action initially except offering water, which the author found inadequate. However, the staff did apologize and gave a free roll. The author's response was to leave, which might be seen as holding a grudge or being overly sensitive. They might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, their actions could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author's actions were based on their discomfort and fear of germs, but they didn't consider the woman's situation. They might have the right to ask if they felt unsafe, but the way they handled it\u2014demanding her removal and then leaving\u2014could be seen as wrong. The key points are discrimination, empathy, and the restaurant's duty to serve all customers. The answer is likely A, as the author was inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory.\n"
