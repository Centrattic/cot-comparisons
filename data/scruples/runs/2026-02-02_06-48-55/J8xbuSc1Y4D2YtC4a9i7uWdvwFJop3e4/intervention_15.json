Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a new restaurant, which was in a sketchy area but had good reviews. They were at the sushi bar, enjoying the food and the friendly chef. Then a homeless woman comes in, sits next to them, starts coughing, looks very dirty, and they feel disgusted. The staff didn't do anything except give her water, so the author and their dad tell the staff they'll leave unless the woman is removed. The staff apologizes, removes her, and the author leaves without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author felt uncomfortable and unwell because of the woman's appearance and cough. They might have been concerned about health or hygiene, or just the overall atmosphere. On the other hand, a homeless person entering a restaurant could be seen as their right to do so unless the restaurant has specific policies against it. The staff didn't ask her to leave initially, so maybe they don't have a policy against homeless people. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the woman was there because the restaurant is open to all. However, if the woman was indeed very ill and the author was worried about the health of others, maybe that's a different angle. But the author's description of her as \"one of the dirtiest looking people\" and the smell might be contributing to their discomfort. Also, the staff did give her water, but didn't remove her until the author intervened. \n\nThe question is whether their action of demanding her to be removed is wrong. If it's based on her homelessness and appearance, that could be a form of prejudice. However, if they felt that her presence was a health hazard due to the cough, that's a different argument. But the author didn't mention any actual illness confirmed by the staff. They just assumed she was sick based on the cough. The staff might not be in a position to ask someone to leave unless there's a clear violation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, treating someone differently because of their appearance or socioeconomic status is generally not okay. So the author might be in the wrong for judging the woman and pressuring the staff to remove her without clear cause. But if the author and their dad felt physically uncomfortable and their dining experience was ruined, that's a personal issue. The problem arises when their discomfort leads to others being treated unfairly. \n\nAnother angle: did the restaurant have a policy against homeless people? If not, the author's demand is overstepping. The staff's apology and removal of the woman might indicate they didn't have a policy against it, hence why they didn't act earlier. The author's action could be seen as discriminatory. However, the author might argue self-preservation. But in public spaces, we often have to tolerate people who are different or in different circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action is based on the woman's appearance and their own discomfort, which could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that they had the right to leave if they felt uncomfortable. But the key point is whether demanding her removal is wrong. Since the staff didn't act before, the author's intervention might be seen as pushing their personal discomfort onto others, which is wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
