Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and dirty. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person went to a restaurant with their dad, the place was crowded, and a homeless woman sat next to them. She was coughing, looked very dirty, and the smell was bad. The customers asked the restaurant to remove her, which they did, and then the customers left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the restaurant serves all customers, including those who might be homeless. Asking for someone to be removed based on appearance or health status might be discriminatory. Also, the restaurant didn't seem to have a problem with her initially, and they provided her with water. The customers intervened, which could be seen as overstepping their role as patrons. The health concerns are real, but unless the person was actually ill or posing a health risk, the customers' reaction might be excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the person felt uncomfortable and even sick because of the smell and cough. They might not be at fault for prioritizing their own well-being. However, their actions led to the removal of someone else from the restaurant, which raises ethical questions about treating others with dignity and respect. \n\nI should also consider the legal aspect. In many places, refusing service based on certain characteristics is illegal, but customers can't demand that others be removed unless there's a safety or health issue. Since the restaurant didn't report any issues and the customer's health wasn't directly threatened, the restaurant's responsibility is to manage such situations. The customers might have acted out of fear or disgust, which isn't their fault per se, but the action of demanding removal could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the customer's request was justified. Since the restaurant didn't take action earlier, and the customer's action was based on appearance and perceived health risks, it's more likely that the author is in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
