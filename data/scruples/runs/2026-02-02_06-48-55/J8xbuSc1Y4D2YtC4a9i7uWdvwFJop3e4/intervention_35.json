Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The story is about them leaving a restaurant because they were uncomfortable with a homeless person being served there. I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the person went to a new restaurant with their dad. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless woman entered. The woman was very dirty, had a severe cough, and smelled bad. The restaurant didn't remove her until the author and their dad demanded it. Then the staff apologized, gave them a free roll, but they left anyway.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the restaurant should serve everyone, right? The woman might have been a paying customer. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, treating the homeless person as a problem to be removed. Also, the smell and coughing were issues, but maybe the restaurant should handle such situations without customers intervening.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt they were in a sketchy part of town, maybe expecting certain standards of cleanliness. They were concerned about health risks from someone coughing nearby, which is understandable. However, the restaurant's job is to manage such situations, not the customers. The staff didn't act, so the author stepped in. But is it their place to demand removal? Maybe they could have asked for a different seat instead of leaving. \n\nAlso, the author might have felt their health was at risk. However, the restaurant should ensure all patrons' safety. If the woman was a public health concern, the restaurant should handle it, not customers. The author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate towards a homeless person who might be using the restaurant for a meal.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility. The restaurant should serve all people, but the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the restaurant didn't act, maybe the author had some justification in protecting their own health. But typically, customers don't have the authority to demand that staff remove someone else from the premises. That's the restaurant's responsibility.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to demand the woman's removal, which is not their role. The restaurant should handle such situations. The fact that the staff eventually complied after the demand suggests they should have addressed it proactively. The author's main issue was with the presence of the homeless person, which could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
