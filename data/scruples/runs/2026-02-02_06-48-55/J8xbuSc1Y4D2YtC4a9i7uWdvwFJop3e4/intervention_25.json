Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went to a new restaurant, and when a homeless woman with a terrible cough and a very dirty appearance came in, they told the staff to remove her, and then left without eating the free roll they were given. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The woman was homeless, visibly unclean, and had a severe cough. The restaurant didn't serve her more than water, and she was eventually removed. The author felt uncomfortable, especially because of the smell, and decided to leave. \n\nFrom a social ethics perspective, treating someone with homelessness with dignity is important. Homelessness is a complex issue, and people in such situations often face stigma and discrimination. The author's immediate reaction to demand her removal could be seen as contributing to that stigma. However, others might argue that they had the right to ask for her removal if they felt their health was at risk, especially given the cough. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers without discrimination. If the staff didn't act to remove her, perhaps they were following policies of inclusion. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a choice, but their behavior in demanding her removal could be considered inconsiderate or even discriminatory.\n\nThe key points to consider are: was the author's reaction based on a legitimate health concern or on prejudice? The cough could be a valid health concern, but the author's reaction to her appearance and smell might indicate bias. Also, the fact that the restaurant didn't provide her with any other food than water might suggest they were accommodating, yet the author still demanded her removal.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often considered wrong to discriminate against people based on their appearance or socioeconomic status. Even if the author felt uncomfortable, reacting by demanding her removal and then leaving might be seen as inconsiderate. The free roll offered by the chef shows an attempt to resolve the situation, but the author's decision to leave regardless could be seen as overly sensitive.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal comfort and health. If someone is coughing violently and emitting a strong odor, it's natural to feel uneasy. The line between reasonable concern and prejudice can be blurry here. The author might argue that they were protecting their own health and dining experience, which is a valid perspective for some, though others might see it as using that as an excuse to avoid discomfort from someone different.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the act of demanding the removal of a homeless person and then leaving the establishment is more in line with discriminatory behavior rather than a justified health concern. The restaurant's staff didn't seem to act, so the author's insistence might be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
