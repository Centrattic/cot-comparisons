Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after they served a homeless person. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. The food was great, but then a homeless woman with a severe cough and poor hygiene entered and sat next to them. The staff didn't initially do anything, just gave her water. The author and dad confronted the staff, demanded they remove her, and left after she was escorted out. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So, they want a second opinion. The question is whether the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nTo evaluate this, I should consider a few key points. First, the restaurant's responsibility to serve all patrons without discrimination. In many places, restaurants can't refuse service based on race, gender, etc., but homeless people are a different matter. However, there's also the aspect of public health and safety. The woman had a severe cough, which could be a health concern, and the author was concerned about illness. However, assuming someone is sick without confirmation isn't ideal. Plus, the author didn't wait for the staff to address the issue but took direct action.\n\nAnother angle is the treatment of the homeless. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, assuming the worst about a homeless person. The smell and cough might have been due to living conditions rather than illness. The author's decision to demand her removal without giving the staff a chance to handle it themselves could be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for their health is understandable. If someone is coughing violently, it's natural to worry about contagious diseases. But the staff's lack of immediate action is also a point. The author might have escalated the situation by confronting the staff instead of just informing them.\n\nLegally, restaurants can ask someone to leave if they're a threat to health or safety, but the line is blurry. The author's behavior could be considered rude or discriminatory, especially if the woman wasn't actually a threat. The fact that they left after the woman was removed and didn't eat the free roll might indicate they felt justified.\n\nSocially, the community might split. Some might empathize with the author's discomfort, while others would criticize the reaction as judgmental. The key question is whether the author's actions were appropriate given the circumstances. Since they didn't wait for staff to handle it and acted on their own assumption of a health risk, they might be seen as in the wrong. However, if the restaurant failed to act, the author's actions could be seen as necessary.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often considers intent and context. If the author was genuinely concerned about health and the staff didn't respond, maybe they're justified. But if they're being discriminatory, that's different. The description mentions the woman was very dirty and coughing, which could be a legitimate health concern. But assuming she was a health risk without confirmation is a problem. Also, the fact that the staff only gave her water suggests they might not have considered her a threat, so the author's intervention could be overstepping.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, especially towards a vulnerable person. The answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because their reaction was based on assumptions and they didn't give the staff a chance to handle it. However, there's a counterargument that the staff didn't act, so the author felt compelled to. But in AITA contexts, the community often frowns upon treating others with disrespect, especially homeless individuals. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
