Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a restaurant, and there was a homeless woman who was very dirty and coughing. The author and their dad told the staff to remove her, and when she was escorted out, they left the restaurant even though they were given a free roll as an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, visibly unwell, and the author felt uncomfortable, leading them to demand her removal. The staff didn't act initially, just gave her water. The author is asking if they were in the wrong for leaving after this.\n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and restaurants often have policies about serving homeless individuals due to public perception or policies. However, the woman was a customer, so the author's demand might be seen as rude or discriminatory. But then again, the author felt health and safety concerns because of the cough and smell. However, the restaurant is responsible for ensuring a safe environment and might have their own protocols.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be personal discomfort and fear of illness, but they didn't wait for the staff to address it. They escalated the situation by demanding her removal, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, leaving because the situation wasn't resolved immediately might be justified if they felt it was affecting their experience, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is a public space, and they have a duty to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate reason to ask someone to leave. The author's actions might have contributed to making the restaurant less welcoming to others who are homeless. However, the author's discomfort is understandable, but reacting by confronting the staff and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not giving the restaurant a chance to handle it themselves and for treating the homeless woman poorly. But there's a balance here between personal comfort and social responsibility. The staff might have had a policy, but the author's reaction was abrupt. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
