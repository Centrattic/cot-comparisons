Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to a new restaurant with their dad, had a good experience, but then a homeless woman entered, was very dirty, coughed a lot, and they asked the staff to remove her. When she was escorted out, they left without eating the free roll and the check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, which is a sensitive issue. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because of her appearance and cough, which they associate with illness. They confronted the staff, leading to her removal. Then they left the restaurant.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is it wrong to ask a person to leave a public place because of their appearance or health? Public places are generally for everyone, so maybe they shouldn't be required to accommodate their discomfort. However, the woman's health (coughing, possible TB) might be a concern for others' safety. But the staff didn't remove her initially unless there was a violation of health codes or rules. The author and dad took it upon themselves to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory or violating the woman's right to be in a public space. The smell and appearance are subjective; others might not mind them. Also, the restaurant might have policies about such situations, but the staff didn't act first, so the customers stepping in could be problematic. The authors' action might have been rude and judgmental. On the other hand, if the woman was a health hazard, maybe they had a right to ask for her removal, but that's a stretch unless she was visibly violating health regulations. The act of leaving after being given a free roll might be seen as a reaction to the situation, but the initial demand might have been the issue. So, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for demanding the woman's removal based on her appearance and cough, rather than the restaurant's policies or health regulations.\n"
