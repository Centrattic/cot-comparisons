Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and looked very dirty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person went to a new restaurant, which was packed. They were at the sushi bar with their dad. A homeless woman sat next to them, coughed a lot, and looked very unclean. The restaurant didn't ask her to leave initially. The person and their dad demanded she be removed, and after she was, they lost their appetite and left, even though the sushi chef offered a free roll.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should analyze the situation from different angles. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place, and the staff has a duty to serve all customers unless they pose a direct threat to health or safety. The woman was a customer, and the staff didn't remove her until the patrons demanded it. The fact that the staff didn't act first might indicate they didn't see her as a threat. The patrons then took it upon themselves to ask for her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory. The woman's appearance and cough might be due to her circumstances, not her fault, and the patrons' reaction could be based on prejudice rather than a real health risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if the woman was indeed coughing in a way that made others uncomfortable, the restaurant might have a responsibility to protect other customers from potential illness. However, the patrons didn't report her to the staff first; they directly demanded her removal. Also, the smell and cough might be legitimate health concerns, but the restaurant's role is to handle such situations, not individual customers. The patrons' actions could be seen as overstepping, assuming the restaurant should remove her without proper assessment.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's policy. If they didn't ask her to leave, maybe they have a policy of serving all customers regardless of appearance. The patrons' insistence might have violated that policy. Also, the fact that the chef apologized and offered a free roll suggests they acknowledged some fault, but the patrons still left, which could be seen as not giving the restaurant a chance to address the issue.\n\nHowever, if the woman was a health risk, the patrons have a right to feel unsafe. But the line between health concern and judgment based on appearance is thin. The description of her cough as sounding like TB is a strong statement, but without medical confirmation, it's an assumption. The smell could be from lack of hygiene due to homelessness, but again, the patrons didn't offer help, just demanded removal.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's important to treat all people with dignity. The patrons' actions might have been based on fear or discomfort rather than a justified health threat. The restaurant's failure to act first could be a flaw, but the patrons' approach was confrontational.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems the patrons acted out of their own comfort without giving the restaurant a chance to handle the situation appropriately. They made a judgment based on appearance and behavior without considering the woman's circumstances. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
