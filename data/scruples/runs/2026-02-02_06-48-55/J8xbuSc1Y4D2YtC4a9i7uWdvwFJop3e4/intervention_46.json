Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person with visible signs of illness and poor hygiene. The person felt uncomfortable and asked the staff to remove her, which they did. Then they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person might be judged for their reaction. On one hand, a restaurant should serve all customers, including homeless individuals. Discriminating against someone based on their appearance or social status is generally frowned upon. The staff didn't refuse service to the homeless woman, which is the right action. \n\nHowever, the person in the story was concerned about health and safety due to the woman's cough and smell. Public health is a valid concern, especially if someone is coughing in a food establishment. If the person genuinely believed there was a risk of disease transmission, maybe their reaction is somewhat understandable, though the way they handled it could be questioned.\n\nBut then, the main issue is their decision to leave. They didn't ask to be seated away from the woman or request a transfer. They directly told the staff to remove her. That might be seen as demanding the restaurant to discriminate. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve everyone, and the patrons have a right to a safe and healthy environment. However, the line between legitimate concern and prejudice is thin here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author and their dad left immediately without even trying the free roll might come off as rude or inconsiderate. The restaurant did apologize and offered compensation. The key point is whether their reaction was based on a reasonable health concern or a bias against homeless individuals. The story mentions the woman's appearance and smell, which could indicate a lack of empathy, but the coughing might be a genuine health issue.\n\nIn terms of judgment, society often values compassion for the homeless and non-discrimination. However, public health is also a priority. If the woman was visibly ill, the staff should have addressed it. The patrons' demand to remove her could be seen as overstepping, assuming the restaurant already took care of her needs (providing water). The action might be viewed as the author prioritizing their comfort over the rights of a homeless person, which could make them the asshole in the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
