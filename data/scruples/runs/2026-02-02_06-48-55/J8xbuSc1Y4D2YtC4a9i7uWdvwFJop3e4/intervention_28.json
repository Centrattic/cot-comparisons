Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was there, specifically because of her appearance and coughing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their dad went to a new sushi place. The place was packed, and they were seated at the bar. Then a homeless woman comes in, appears very dirty, coughs a lot, and the restaurant didn't seem to do much. The customers then demanded she be removed, which they did, and the customers left without eating more.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate if their actions were justified.\n\nHomelessness is a sensitive issue. People experiencing homelessness often face stigma and discrimination. The author's reasoning here seems to be about health concerns and personal discomfort. But is it fair to ask a business to remove a customer just because they look different or are sick? Restaurants are public spaces and generally can't discriminate against customers based on appearance unless there's a legitimate health threat. However, the woman was coughing, which could be a health concern. But is that enough to demand her removal?\n\nOn one hand, the author felt uncomfortable and threatened, which is understandable. On the other hand, demanding someone's removal based on their appearance and a cough might be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant might have a policy about health and safety, but unless the woman was clearly contagious or violating specific rules, the action might not be appropriate. Also, the fact that the staff didn't act on their own could indicate that the woman's presence wasn't a problem for them, and the customers overstepped.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the woman was escorted out after they demanded it. That implies that the customers exerted pressure on the restaurant to do something, which might not have been necessary. The author's discomfort led to an action that affected another person's right to be in a public space.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. The restaurant should be responsible for handling such situations according to health codes, not customers demanding someone's removal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
