Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman with a severe cough and poor hygiene who was served at the same restaurant. The author and their dad confronted the staff, leading to the woman being escorted out, after which they left without eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The restaurant serves all customers regardless of their background, which is a principle of equal treatment. The homeless woman is a customer, and the author's reaction is based on her appearance and cough. The staff didn't do anything to address the situation initially, which the author might have found unacceptable. However, the author's action of demanding her removal could be seen as discriminatory, as they're prioritizing their own comfort over another person's right to service. \n\nThe author might argue that the situation posed a health risk due to the cough and smell, but the staff did provide a glass of water, indicating they were handling the situation. The author's immediate reaction to leave might be seen as rude, but their concern for health could be a valid point. However, the main issue is the request to remove the woman, which could be considered discriminatory. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman's presence might have made the dining experience unpleasant, and the author is within their rights to ask for removal if they felt it was a health hazard. However, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, and the staff's inaction might have contributed to the author's frustration. \n\nConsidering these factors, the decision to leave is more about the author's personal discomfort, which isn't the restaurant's fault. The act of demanding the woman's removal is where the ethical issue lies. So the author might be in the wrong for treating a homeless person in a discriminatory manner. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
