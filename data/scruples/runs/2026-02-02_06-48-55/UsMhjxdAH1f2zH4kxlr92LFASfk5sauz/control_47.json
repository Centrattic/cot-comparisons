She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's wife went out to dinner with a female friend the day before the incident. She was supposed to be back by 8 pm. The author, who was at his regular's table, called her when he was about to leave earlier, but she didn't pick up. He didn't think much of it and went home. When he arrived, her car wasn't there, so he tried calling again. He did some housework, watched TV, and sent a text at 10 pm asking when she'd be home. He also mentioned needing her to revisit some paperwork, which she read but didn't reply to. \n\nBy 11 pm, he's really worried because it's a big city and it's not like her to not answer. He uses Android's Find My Device feature on her phone to track her location. He found she was in a familiar place, so he thought he was okay. But she got a notification about her phone being located and was upset. When she came home at midnight, she was grumpy because they had to get up early and she blamed him for not trusting her. The author is unsure if he's an asshole or just being stupid.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife was out with a friend, which isn't inherently suspicious. The author was worried when she didn't answer and didn't show up on time. He tracked her phone without her knowledge. While his intention was out of concern, tracking someone's location without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if he was worried, the act of using the tracking feature without informing her might be seen as violating her trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. The wife might feel that her privacy was invaded, even if the author had good intentions. The fact that she was notified about the tracking could make her feel that he didn't respect her boundaries. The author's justification is that he was worried, but there might be other ways to handle the situation, like checking with her friend or using a more direct conversation approach. \n\nAlso, the wife came home late and was upset about the lack of sleep, which she attributed to the author. This suggests that the tracking might have caused some conflict. While the author's actions were out of concern, the method he used could be considered overstepping. \n\nSo, the key points here are: tracking without consent, the lack of communication about the tracking, and the resulting breach of trust. Even though the author was worried, the act itself is a privacy violation, which is a big deal. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the unauthorized tracking and the impact on trust.\n"
