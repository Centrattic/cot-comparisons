She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location. The situation is that the author used their phone to track her, worried when she didn't answer calls, and ended up causing her anger because she found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's intention was concern for their wife's safety. They mention that she didn't answer calls, her car wasn't home, and they had to meet early. Their actions were driven by genuine worry. But the method they used\u2014tracking her phone\u2014without her knowledge is a privacy issue. \n\nNow, the question is whether the ends justify the means. Even though the author's concern is understandable, tracking someone's location without their consent can be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. The wife felt untrusted, which is a valid reaction. The author might argue they were worried, but there are other ways to handle it, like contacting mutual friends or waiting a bit longer before taking such steps. \n\nAlso, the fact that the tracking feature sent a notice to the wife shows that the system is designed to protect privacy. The author should have respected her privacy and discussed their concerns openly instead of resorting to tracking. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and this action might have eroded that trust, even if the intent was good.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to ensure her safety, the method used was a breach of privacy. The balance between concern and respecting autonomy is key here. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the action violated trust and privacy, despite the good intentions.\n"
