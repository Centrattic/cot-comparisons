She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone. The scenario is that his wife didn't come home when expected, he got worried, and used her phone's location tracking. She found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent. Did the wife know he had access to her phone's location? If he set up tracking without her knowledge, that's a privacy issue. Even if his intent was concern, privacy is a big deal. People generally expect their personal information, like location, to be private unless they've agreed otherwise.\n\nThen there's the method. Android's Find My Device usually requires permission. If he accessed it without her knowing, that's a breach of trust. He mentions she got a notification, which implies the feature might be designed to alert users if someone accesses their location. So, technically, he might have violated the app's intended use.\n\nHis reasoning was worry, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Trust in a relationship is important. If he's concerned about her safety, communication is key. Maybe he should have waited longer, called more, or talked about his worries instead of using tracking. The fact that she came home late and was grumpy adds tension, but his action was invasive regardless of her mood.\n\nAlso, the wife didn't respond to his messages, which could have other explanations. Tracking her without asking could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. Even if she was late, she might have had a valid reason, and he shouldn't assume the worst without communication.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between privacy and safety. If there were signs of real danger (like multiple missed calls, threats), tracking might be a different scenario. But in this case, it was just a late return. The husband's action was a breach of privacy, even if his intent was good. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
