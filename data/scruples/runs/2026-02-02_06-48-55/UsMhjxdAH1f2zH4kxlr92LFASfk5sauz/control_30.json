She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The author's wife went out for dinner with a friend, and she said she'd be home by 8 PM. The author called her, but she didn't answer. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, and tried contacting her again without success. He eventually used the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. He found out where she was, which eased his worry. However, she found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author didn't ask his wife if it was okay to track her phone. Even though his intention was out of concern, using a tracking feature without her knowledge is a privacy violation. In many relationships, trust is crucial, and actions like this can erode that trust. The wife felt untrusted, which is valid. There's also the fact that he didn't communicate his actions or reasons to her after the fact. \n\nOn the other hand, he was worried about her safety, especially since she didn't respond to calls and came home late. His intention wasn't malicious. However, the method he used\u2014tracking her phone without her consent\u2014is problematic. There are other ways to handle situations where someone is worried about a partner's safety, like contacting mutual friends or local authorities if there's a real emergency. \n\nAnother angle is whether the tracking feature was set up with her permission. If he had set it up without her knowing, that's another privacy issue. If the phone was linked to his account without her consent, that's a separate problem. Even if it was his phone, unless she agreed to be tracked, it's a privacy breach. \n\nThe wife's reaction is important here. She's upset because he didn't trust her, and she was grumpy the next day. This indicates that the action hurt her feelings and damaged their relationship. The author should consider that even if his intentions were good, the action was a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, open communication is key. Instead of tracking her, he could have discussed his concerns with her, set boundaries, or talked about how to handle such situations in the future. Tracking without consent, regardless of intent, is generally seen as wrong because it disregards the other person's autonomy and privacy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author had good intentions, the act of tracking his wife's location without her knowledge or consent is a violation of her privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
