She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. I need to analyze the situation based on the provided details.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The wife went out for dinner with a friend, told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He called her when he got home early, but she didn't answer. Her car wasn't there. He tried texting and calling multiple times but got no response. By 11 PM, he used her phone's location tracking feature to check where she was. He found her at a familiar place, which made him feel better. However, she found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this is the author's fault. Privacy is a big factor here. Even with good intentions, tracking someone's location without their consent can be a violation of trust. The wife was a grown woman, and she had every right to privacy. The husband's actions, though motivated by concern, overstepped into her personal space. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and such actions can erode that trust. Even if there were legitimate worries, the proper approach would have been to communicate and express his concerns rather than secretly tracking her. The wife feeling \"grumpy\" and blaming him for lack of trust supports that the action was perceived as a breach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he didn't think she'd find out, which shows a lack of consideration for her privacy. The fact that he used her phone's location tracking without asking is a clear violation of her boundaries. Relationships require mutual respect, and this action seems to lack that. While the intention was to ensure her safety, there are better ways to handle such situations, like checking with her friends or contacting them directly. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband was worried because she didn't respond and was late. However, even in such cases, the right approach isn't to invade her privacy. The wife's reaction is valid because feeling spied on can lead to feelings of distrust and disrespect. The husband should have discussed his concerns openly instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions might have been good, the act of tracking her phone without consent is a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
