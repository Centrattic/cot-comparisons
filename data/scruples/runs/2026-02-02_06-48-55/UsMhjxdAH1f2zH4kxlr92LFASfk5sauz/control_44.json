She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking their wife's phone. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's location using her phone without her knowledge. He was worried because she didn't answer his calls and came home late. He thought it was okay because he was worried about her safety. But she found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her. The user is asking if he's an asshole for doing this.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Even if the intent was good, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy violation. Trust in a relationship is important. The wife might feel that his actions undermine her autonomy and trust. He mentioned he didn't think she'd find out, but that doesn't excuse it. There's a lack of communication here. Maybe he should have talked to her about his concerns instead of using the tracking feature. Also, using a feature like \"find my device\" is typically for emergency situations, not routine worry. So even though he was worried, the method he used might be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut on the other hand, he was concerned about her safety. However, the appropriate action might have been to contact her friends or check in with them, not use her phone's location. Also, he could have waited a bit longer before taking such a step. The fact that she was with a friend and came home safely might mean his actions were unnecessary. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. Even if the intention is good, the action can still be wrong. So the husband's decision to track her without consent is likely the wrong move. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
