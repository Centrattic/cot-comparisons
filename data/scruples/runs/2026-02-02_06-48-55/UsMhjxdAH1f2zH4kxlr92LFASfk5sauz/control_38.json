She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by tracking his wife's phone without her knowledge. So, the situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband got worried. He used her phone's location feature via Android Find. The wife found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy issues. Tracking someone's phone without their consent is a big privacy violation. Even if the husband had good intentions, like being worried, it's still unauthorized. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might have broken that trust. The wife felt untrusted, which is a valid reaction. \n\nBut then, the husband was worried. She didn't come home, didn't answer calls, and he was concerned about her safety. However, there might have been other ways to handle the situation. Maybe calling more times, sending more texts, or contacting her friend to check on her. \n\nThe problem here is the method he chose. Instead of communicating or finding alternative ways to check on her, he used a tracking method without her knowledge. Even if he thought it was harmless, the fact that she received a notice and got mad shows that it's not acceptable. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, the husband's action was a breach of privacy. Even though his intentions were good, the action itself was wrong. Privacy is important, and unless there's an emergency where there's a real threat to someone's life, tracking without permission isn't justified. The wife's reaction is understandable because she expects trust and respect in the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he violated her privacy without consent, even if his motives were concern for her safety.\n"
