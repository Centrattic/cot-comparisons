She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The story is that the wife went out with a friend, the husband got worried when she didn't pick up his call, noticed her car wasn't home, tried contacting her multiple times, and eventually used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. He thought she wouldn't notice because he didn't get alerts when his phone was tracked. But she did get a notification and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Tracking someone's phone without their consent is a big deal. Even if the husband had good intentions\u2014like being worried about her safety\u2014it's still a violation of her privacy. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might be seen as a breach of that trust. The wife being upset makes sense because she didn't give permission for her location to be monitored. \n\nBut there's also the angle of concern for her safety. He waited until 11 PM, tried calling, texting, and then resorted to tracking. Maybe he was genuinely worried and felt like he had no other options. However, there might be other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friend to check on her or involving local authorities if he was really concerned. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he thought she wouldn't find out, which shows a lack of consideration for her privacy. Even if he had good intentions, the method he used was invasive. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels her privacy was violated. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of tracking her, maybe he should have discussed his concerns with her beforehand. Now that she's upset, he needs to address her feelings and perhaps explain his reasoning, but that doesn't negate the fact that he acted without her consent.\n\nSo, while his intentions might be understandable, the action of tracking her phone without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
