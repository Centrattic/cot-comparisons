She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone location.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband called his wife when he got home early, but she didn't answer. Her car wasn't there, so he tried contacting her again. When she didn't respond, he used his account on Android's Find My Device to locate her. He found her at a familiar location, thought it was okay, but she found out and is upset. She came home late, was grumpy, and blamed him for not trusting her.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The key points are consent and trust. The husband didn't inform his wife he was tracking her phone. Even if his intentions were out of concern, privacy is important in relationships. Using a tracking feature without her knowledge is a breach of privacy. Trust is a two-way street; while the wife was out without answering, she might not have realized the concern he had. However, the husband should have had a conversation first. Maybe he could have waited a bit more before acting, or asked her friends for help instead. \n\nPossible arguments for the husband: He was worried about her safety. The wife didn't respond to calls or texts, leading to genuine concern. He found her in a safe place, so no harm done. \n\nBut the fact remains that he accessed her location without her knowledge. Even if it's a shared account or something, using the tracking without permission is a problem. Privacy issues can erode trust. The wife feeling untrusted is valid because he didn't communicate his concerns or check in another way. \n\nAlso, the husband's statement that he didn't think she'd find out shows he wasn't considering her right to privacy. Maybe he should have had an open discussion about such situations beforehand. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. While the husband's intentions were to ensure her safety, the method was invasive. The wife's reaction is reasonable because she feels her privacy was violated without cause. The husband's actions, though well-meaning, were a breach of privacy and trust. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone without her consent, despite his intentions.\n"
