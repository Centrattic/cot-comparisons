She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the husband was worried when his wife didn't come home on time. He used the phone tracking feature to see her location, which he did on his own account, thinking she wouldn't notice. But she got a notification and is upset now. \n\nHe mentions that he had a legitimate reason\u2014concern for her safety in a big city. He didn't want to call her again because she didn't pick up before. The problem is the method he used. Without her knowledge or consent, using her phone's location tracking is a privacy issue. Even if the intent was to check on her, the act itself is an invasion of privacy.\n\nEven if his intentions were good, the key point is consent. Trust in a relationship relies on mutual respect and communication. By not discussing the situation with her first or getting her permission, he overstepped. He could have communicated his concerns instead of tracking her. \n\nShe was upset because he didn't trust her, leading to arguments and strained feelings. The husband's actions, while out of worry, didn't consider her autonomy and privacy, which are important in a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, even though his motives were to ensure her safety, the method was a breach of trust. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he violated her privacy without consent. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
