She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking their wife's phone. The main points are: the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, the husband got worried, used her phone's location tracking, found out she was okay, but she got mad. Now the question is whether this was wrong.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor here. When you track someone's phone without their knowledge or consent, it invades their privacy. Even if the motive is concern, the act itself is a breach of trust. The husband mentioned he didn't think she'd find out, but she did. That shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and boundaries.\n\nThen there's the communication aspect. Instead of tracking, maybe he could have reached out more directly, like contacting the friend or using other methods to check on her. He did call and text, but maybe he could have considered that she might be busy or intentionally not answering. Using the tracking feature might have been an overstep, especially since it's a feature that's meant to be used with consent.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She's upset because she feels disrespected and not trusted. The husband's action might have made her feel like her autonomy was violated. Even if his intention was to ensure her safety, the method he chose had negative consequences on their relationship.\n\nOn the other side, the husband was worried because she didn't come home on time and they had an important task. His concern is valid, but the solution he chose was problematic. There's a balance between concern for safety and respecting personal space. In this case, the balance tipped towards the wrong side because of the lack of transparency and consent.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. When one partner takes actions that the other might see as intrusive, it can lead to tension. The husband's action, while coming from a place of worry, didn't account for the wife's perspective and feelings. So even if he thought he was doing the right thing, the outcome shows that it was a mistake.\n\nTherefore, considering privacy, communication, and trust, the husband was in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
