She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author tracked his wife's location using her phone. He mentions that she went out for dinner with a female friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. He called her but she didn't pick up, so he went home. When she wasn't there and didn't respond, he started getting worried. He ended up using the Android Find feature to locate her phone. He found her at a familiar place and thought she wouldn't notice, but she did get a notification and is upset. She came home late, was grumpy, and blamed him for not trusting her. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is tracking someone's phone location without their consent. Even if the intent was out of concern, it's a privacy violation. Trust is a big part of relationships, and actions that undermine that trust can be problematic. The author's justification is that he was worried about her safety in a big city, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. \n\nHe should have considered alternative ways to handle the situation. For example, maybe calling again, reaching out to her friend, or informing others he knows she's with. Instead, he took a direct but invasive action. The fact that the phone's location tracking feature sent a notification to her shows that the system was designed to alert users when someone else is tracking their location, which is a clear red flag. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction indicates that she felt her privacy was invaded. Even if she was late, being tracked might make her feel like her autonomy is not respected. The author's action might lead to ongoing trust issues. While his intention was to ensure her safety, the method was inappropriate. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. If he was worried about her safety, he could have discussed his concerns with her beforehand to have a plan in place. Tracking her phone without her knowledge breaks that trust. So, even though his motivations were good, the action itself is a breach of privacy and trust, making him at fault.\n"
