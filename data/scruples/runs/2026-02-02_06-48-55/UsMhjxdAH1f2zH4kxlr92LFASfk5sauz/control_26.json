She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. Let me read through the situation again and break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the wife went out to dinner with a female friend, told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He called her when he got home earlier, but she didn't answer. He didn't think much of it. When he got home, her car wasn't there, so he tried calling again. Then he did some housework and watched TV. By 10 PM, she still hadn't called back. He sent a text because he needed her help with paperwork. At 10:30, still no response. They usually go to bed at 10, so he's getting worried. At 11, he called her twice. Then he used the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. He found her at a familiar location, thought she was safe. He didn't think she'd find out, but she did and is upset. He felt worried but didn't see another option. Now she's mad, says he doesn't trust her. He's asking if he's an asshole or just stupid.\n\nSo, the main issue here is tracking a spouse's location without their knowledge or consent. Even if the intention was out of concern, privacy is a big deal in relationships. Did he have a right to use her phone's location feature without her knowing? Probably not. The wife's privacy was invaded, even if it was with good intentions. There might have been other ways to handle the situation, like being more direct in communication, maybe checking in again, or contacting her friends. Instead of tracking her phone, he could have tried other methods to ensure her safety. Also, the fact that he used her phone's tracking feature implies that he had access to her account, which might not have been properly set up with his access in mind. The wife's reaction is understandable because it's a breach of trust and privacy. Even if he was worried, the method he chose was invasive and without consent. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
