She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who tracked their wife's location is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's phone because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. He used the Android Find My Device feature. She found out and is upset, feeling he didn't trust her. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Privacy is a big factor here. Even if his intention was concern, accessing her location without her consent might be a breach of trust. But he did get worried because she didn't respond and was out later than expected. Maybe he felt it was necessary to ensure her safety.\n\nOn one hand, he had valid concerns. She didn't answer calls, came home late, and he needed to check on her. On the other hand, tracking someone without their knowledge can be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if it's a spouse, mutual trust and communication are key. Maybe there's a better way to handle such situations, like talking about setting up a way to check in without invading privacy.\n\nAlso, he used a feature he thought wouldn't alert her. That's a bit of a mistake because some tracking services might send notifications. But the fact that he did it without asking is the main issue. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might have made her feel that her privacy wasn't respected.\n\nSo, while his intentions were good, the action itself was a breach of privacy. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because consent is crucial even in relationships. However, there's a counterpoint about his concern for her safety. But in the end, the act of tracking without consent is problematic. So I think the answer is A.\n"
