She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. Hmm. The key points here are the actions taken and the reasons behind them.\n\nThe author's wife went out with a friend and said she'd be back by 8pm. The author tried to reach her but she didn't answer. When he got home, her car wasn't there, so he got worried. After several attempts to contact her with no response, he used the Android Find My Device feature to locate her. He found her in a familiar place, which made him feel better, but she found out and is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether this is an asshole move or just a mistake. The author claims he was worried and thought she might be in trouble. But tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intent was to ensure safety, the method used was invasive. There's also the fact that he didn't consider she might not want him to know her location at all times, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nI need to weigh the intent (concern for her safety) against the violation of privacy. In relationships, trust is important. If the wife felt that her privacy was invaded, that's a big deal. The author might have acted out of fear, but there are other ways to handle the situation, like contacting her friends or authorities if she didn't come home. Using tracking without consent is a gray area, but in most cases, it's seen as a breach of trust. So, probably the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
