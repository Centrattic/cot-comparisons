She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The wife went out with a friend, said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband called her but she didn't answer. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, and tried to reach her again. At 10 PM, he texts her about paperwork. No response. By 11 PM, he uses the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. She found out and is upset. He was worried because she was out later than expected in a big city.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. The husband accessed his wife's location without her consent. Even if he had good intentions (concern for her safety), using her phone's tracking feature without telling her is a privacy violation. Trust and mutual respect in a relationship are crucial. While his actions were driven by worry, it's important to consider that he didn't communicate his concerns directly instead of secretly tracking her. \n\nThere are other ways he could have handled the situation, like contacting her friends or local authorities if she was unresponsive. However, he chose a method that intruded on her privacy. The wife's reaction is valid because it's about trust and boundaries. The husband's justification that he thought she wouldn't notice doesn't mitigate the breach. So, even if his intentions were good, the action itself is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong."
