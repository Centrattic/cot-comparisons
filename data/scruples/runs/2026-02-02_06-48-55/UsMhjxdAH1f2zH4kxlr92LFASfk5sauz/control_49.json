She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person tracked their wife's location via her phone because they were worried when she didn't answer their calls and came home late. The wife found out and is upset because she feels her privacy was invaded. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they were worried because their wife didn't come home as expected and didn't answer calls. They used a tracking feature thinking it would be okay if they checked her location. But the wife was mad because she felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nNow, from a privacy perspective, even if the intention was good, tracking someone without their consent is generally considered a violation of their privacy. Relationships require trust, and secretly tracking someone's location could be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the author was worried, the method they used might not be acceptable. There's an expectation of privacy in personal devices, even within a marriage. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was concern for their wife's safety. They mention that they were worried because it was a big city and anything could happen. So, there's a balance between concern for safety and respecting privacy. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the action was wrong. The wife didn't consent to being tracked, and the fact that she received a notice about her phone's location suggests that the system is designed to notify the user if someone else is accessing their location. That means the author's action is against the intended use of the feature, which is meant to protect privacy. \n\nIn many cases, even with good intentions, violating someone's privacy without their consent is considered wrong. The wife's reaction is valid because it's about trust and autonomy. The author could have handled the situation differently, like checking with friends or contacting the restaurant where she was, instead of secretly tracking her phone. \n\nSo, while the intention was to ensure her safety, the method used was a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
