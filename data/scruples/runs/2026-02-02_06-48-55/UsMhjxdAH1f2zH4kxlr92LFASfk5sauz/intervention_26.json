She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The key points here are about privacy, trust, and the circumstances leading to the action.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he was worried when his wife didn't answer his calls and her car wasn't home. He used the Android Find feature, which he thought wouldn't alert her. He was genuinely concerned because it was late and she didn't come home as expected. However, he ended up violating her privacy, which she found out about and was upset about. She felt he didn't trust her, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering privacy and trust in a relationship. Even with good intentions, using someone's phone without their consent is a breach of trust. The husband didn't ask for her permission or discuss his concerns, which could have been a better approach. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and actions like this can erode it, even if done out of concern. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable because she might feel that her privacy was invaded. Even though she didn't answer the calls, the husband could have considered other possibilities, like her phone being on silent or her being busy. The fact that he didn't communicate his worries and instead took unilateral action is problematic. \n\nHowever, the husband's concern wasn't unfounded\u2014he was worried about her safety. But the method he chose (tracking her phone) was inappropriate. There are other ways to address his concerns, like calmly discussing his fears with her or checking in another way, perhaps by contacting her friend. \n\nIn many relationships, transparency and communication are key. Using tracking without consent, regardless of the reason, can be seen as a violation. The husband's mistake was not communicating his concerns and instead acting on his own, which led to mistrust. \n\nSo, even though his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method was wrong. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because of the privacy breach and lack of communication, despite his initial concern.\n"
