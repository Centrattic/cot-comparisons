She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone was in the wrong. The situation involves the wife going out with a friend, the husband not hearing from her, getting worried, and using a tracking app. The wife found out and is upset, leading the husband to question if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried about his wife's safety, especially since she didn't come home on time. He tried calling and messaging, which went unanswered. In his anxiety, he used the phone's tracking feature, which he didn't realize would notify her. Now she's upset because he didn't trust her, even though his intention was to check on her.\n\nBut the key point here is privacy. The wife didn't consent to being tracked. Even though the husband had good intentions, tracking someone's location without their knowledge or consent is a breach of trust. The husband should have respected her privacy and not used the tracking feature. Instead of tracking, he might have considered other options, like contacting the friend or checking with others who might know her whereabouts.\n\nAlso, the husband's actions led to her feeling untrusted, which could harm their relationship. Even if he was worried, the method he chose was inappropriate. It's important to communicate openly and address concerns without invading privacy. So while his concern was understandable, the action was a violation of trust and privacy, making him at least partially at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). The husband acted without consent and overstepped by using tracking, which is a privacy issue regardless of intent.\n"
