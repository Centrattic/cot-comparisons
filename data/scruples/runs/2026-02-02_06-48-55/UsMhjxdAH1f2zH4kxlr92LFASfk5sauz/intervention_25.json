She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author called his wife multiple times without getting a response. His wife didn't come home until midnight, which is unusual. He was worried because it's a big city and safety is a concern. He used her phone's location tracking feature to find out where she was. The wife got a notification that her phone was being tracked and is upset.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband had a legitimate concern for his wife's safety. She didn't answer calls, and she's a woman in a big city. He tried to check on her using a feature that he thought she wouldn't notice, but she did. That's a problem because it's a violation of her privacy. Even if his intentions were good, using her device without consent is an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, he was worried and didn't know where she was. Maybe he felt he had no other options. But consent is key here. If he had asked her where she was or if he had a conversation instead of using tracking, that would be different. Tracking without telling her is a breach of trust. Even if it's for safety, it's still a privacy invasion.\n\nAlso, the wife was grumpy the next day and blamed him for not trusting her. That suggests that she felt disrespected. The husband should have considered her feelings and maybe communicated better. There might have been other ways to handle the situation, like reaching out to her friend or calling the police if she didn't answer after some time.\n\nSo, even though the husband's intentions were protective, the action of tracking without her knowledge is a violation of her privacy. That makes the author in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
