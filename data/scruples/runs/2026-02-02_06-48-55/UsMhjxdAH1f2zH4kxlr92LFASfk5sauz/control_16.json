She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife went out with a female friend and was supposed to be back by 8 PM but didn't show up. The husband called her, but she didn't answer. He then went home, noticed her car wasn't there, and tried contacting her multiple times without success. He was worried because it's a big city and anything could happen. He used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location, which he had used before without her knowing. However, she found out and is upset, feeling that he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. The husband didn't tell his wife he was tracking her, which could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Even if his intentions were out of concern, the act of tracking without her knowledge might be considered a breach of trust. Trust in a relationship is mutual; even if one party is worried, the other might feel disrespected if their privacy is invaded without permission.\n\nHowever, the husband's actions were driven by genuine concern, especially after multiple failed attempts to contact her. He mentions that she had been marked as read on a message about important paperwork, which might add to his worry. Still, the method he chose to use involved tracking her phone, which could be seen as overstepping, regardless of his intentions.\n\nIn many relationships, privacy is important. Even if the wife's behavior wasn't suspicious, the husband's action of tracking without consent could be viewed as a mistake. The wife's reaction about feeling untrusted is valid because transparency is key. The husband didn't discuss his concerns with her or ask for her permission to use the tracking feature. Instead, he acted on his own, which led to her feeling betrayed.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a worrying situation, such actions are understandable. However, the lack of communication and the breach of privacy likely outweigh the concern in this case. The husband should have considered other ways to address his worry, maybe by contacting her friend or involving local authorities instead of using a tracking method without her knowledge.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was a privacy violation even if done with good intentions. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
