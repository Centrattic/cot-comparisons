She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong by tracking his wife's location.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife went out with a friend and said she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband found out he was home earlier but her car wasn't there. He tried calling but no answer. He ended up tracking her phone via Find My Device and found her location. She got a notification and got mad. He says he was worried because she didn't come home when she said and there's no history of her being late without notice. She came back late and was upset, blaming him for not trusting her.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and privacy. The husband used a tracking feature without her explicit consent. Even if he had good intentions (like being worried), using such a feature without telling her could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and actions that undermine that trust, even with good intentions, can be problematic.\n\nHe mentioned that he tried the feature before and didn't get notifications, but she did this time. That might be a tech issue, but the main issue is the act of tracking without her knowing. She felt her privacy was violated, and he admitted he thought she wouldn't find out. This suggests he didn't consider her feelings or her right to privacy.\n\nEven though he was concerned, there are other ways he could have handled the situation, like calling repeatedly, contacting her friend, or waiting a bit longer. Tracking without consent might not be the best approach. His actions led to her feeling untrusted, which is a significant issue in a relationship.\n\nSo, while his intentions were to check on her safety, the method he used without her knowledge is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he violated her privacy without her consent, which is a breach of trust.\n"
