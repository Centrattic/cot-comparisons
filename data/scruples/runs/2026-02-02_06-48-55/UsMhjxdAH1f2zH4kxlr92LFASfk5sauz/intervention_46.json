She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author tracked his wife's location via her phone because he was worried when she didn't come home on time. The key points here are consent, privacy, and trust.\n\nFirst, the author didn't ask his wife if it was okay to track her phone. Even though he had a legitimate reason for being worried, using the tracking feature without her permission is a big privacy issue. People have a right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. The fact that he didn't discuss this with her beforehand is a problem.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. The wife was upset because he didn't trust her. If you're in a committed relationship, trust is a fundamental part. By tracking her without telling her, he might have broken that trust, even if his intention was to ensure her safety. It's possible that there's an underlying issue of trust in the relationship that needs to be addressed through communication rather than surveillance.\n\nThe author mentioned that he thought she wouldn't find out. That's a risky assumption. Even if the tracking feature didn't notify her by default, relying on that without her knowledge is a breach of privacy. The wife's reaction is understandable because her personal data was accessed without her consent.\n\nAlso, the wife came home late, but that doesn't necessarily mean there was a problem. Maybe she had a valid reason for being late, like staying for dinner or socializing. The author's reaction stems from worry, which is natural, but the method he used to address that worry is questionable.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, maybe he could have communicated more, checked in with her in a respectful way, or discussed his concerns about her safety. Instead of tracking her phone, he could have talked to her about his worries and established some kind of agreement for future situations. Using a tracking app without her consent is a form of covert surveillance, which is generally frowned upon unless there's a legal or safety reason, like in cases of abuse or danger, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014the lack of consent, the invasion of privacy, and the impact on trust\u2014it seems like the author did something wrong. Even with good intentions, the method he used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
