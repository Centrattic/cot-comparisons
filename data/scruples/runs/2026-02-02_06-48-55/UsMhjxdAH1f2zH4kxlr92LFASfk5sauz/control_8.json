She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband tracked his wife's phone location because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. She was out with a friend, came home late, and found out he tracked her. She's upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind his actions. He was worried because she didn't respond, her car wasn't home, and it's a big city. He used the Android Find My Device feature, which he thought she wouldn't notice. But she did notice and is now mad. \n\nOn one hand, his concern for her safety is understandable. He didn't know what happened, and it's late. He might have felt it was necessary to check on her. On the other hand, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if it's out of worry, it's an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe wife is upset because he didn't trust her. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he had communicated his concerns instead of tracking her, maybe she would have been more understanding. But tracking her without telling her might have made her feel like he didn't respect her boundaries. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of how he handled the situation. He tried to track her after multiple failed attempts to contact her. But instead of maybe involving someone else or waiting longer, he chose to use her phone's location feature. \n\nSo, while his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method he used breached her privacy. In a healthy relationship, open communication is key. He should have discussed his concerns with her before taking such actions. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not respecting her privacy even if his intent was good.\n"
