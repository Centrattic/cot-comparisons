She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone. Hmm. So, the situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer her phone, and the husband got worried because she wasn't home by 10 PM. He used the Android Find My Device feature to track her. She came home late, was grumpy, and he got in trouble for not trusting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because she didn't respond and wasn't home on time. He mentions she's a strong woman, but he's in a big city where anything could happen. So his motivation was concern for her safety. But tracking her phone without her knowledge is a privacy issue. Even if he had good intentions, did he have her consent?\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he acted out of fear for her safety. On the other hand, accessing her phone's location without permission breaches her privacy. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action might have undermined that. Even if he thought it was okay because the location showed she was safe, the act itself without her knowledge is problematic.\n\nAlso, the wife felt blamed and that he didn't trust her. The husband acknowledges that she didn't respond to his earlier message about paperwork, but maybe he should have considered that she might be busy or had other reasons for not answering. Instead of tracking, maybe he could have given her more time or tried another method of communication.\n\nIn relationships, privacy boundaries are crucial. Even if well-intentioned, violating those boundaries can cause harm. So, while the husband's actions were driven by concern, the method he used was disrespectful of her autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because the action itself was a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the intent.\n"
