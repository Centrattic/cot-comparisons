She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is that he tracked his wife's location using her phone because she wasn't answering his calls and he got worried. She later found out and is upset. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He called her, she didn't pick up. Her car wasn't there. He tried multiple times, got worried. Then he used her phone's location feature to check where she was. He says he didn't think she'd find out because he didn't get any notifications when he used his own phone's feature. But she did get a notice.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and trust. Even if his intentions were good, tracking someone's location without their knowledge or consent is a privacy issue. People generally expect their location to be private unless there's an explicit agreement. He didn't ask her if he could track her, even though he was worried. His actions might have been out of concern, but they violated her privacy.\n\nAlso, he mentions she came home grumpy and blamed him for not trusting her. That suggests that his actions hurt her feelings and made her feel untrusted. Even if he was worried, the method he used wasn't respectful of her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, he was genuinely worried and didn't have any prior incidents. But privacy is a big deal. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If he had a conversation with her about his concerns instead of tracking her, it might have been a better approach. \n\nSo, even though his intentions were good, the act itself without consent is a breach of privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
