She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location. The situation is that the wife went out to dinner with a friend and didn't answer her phone. The husband got worried, especially since they needed to get up early, and used her phone's location tracking to check where she was. He found out she was in a familiar place, but she got mad because he used her phone without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the action. The husband was worried because she wasn't responding. But tracking someone's phone without their consent is generally an invasion of privacy. Even if the intention was to ensure her safety, there are other ways to handle the situation. He could have called more, waited a bit longer, or maybe asked their friends to check in. Also, he mentioned that he didn't receive any notifications when his phone was tracked, leading him to believe it was okay. However, privacy policies usually state that tracking requires permission. The wife's reaction is about being trusted, so the husband's action might have breached that trust, even if well-intentioned.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of him being genuinely concerned. People might argue that in stressful situations, such actions are understandable. However, privacy is a key issue here. The fact that she got a notification and felt betrayed suggests that her privacy was violated. The husband's mistake was not respecting her boundaries, even if his motives were good. So, while his intent was to care for her safety, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated his wife's privacy without her consent, which is a significant issue in a relationship.\n"
