She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation involves him using Android's Find My Device feature without her knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy issues. Even if his intentions were to check on her safety, accessing her phone's location without her consent is a breach of privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and such actions can erode that trust. The wife felt betrayed because she wasn't informed, and she's upset about being tracked.\n\nNext, the husband's reasoning: he was worried when she didn't answer his calls or texts, especially since she had a history of being prompt. However, there are other ways to handle the situation, like contacting mutual friends or using other non-invasive methods to check on her. Tracking her phone without her knowledge crosses a line, regardless of the intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that the tracking feature sent a notification to her indicates that the system was designed to alert users when their location is being accessed. This means the husband's action was detectable and thus a direct violation of her privacy.\n\nThe wife's reaction is valid; she feels untrusted and there's a lack of communication. The husband didn't discuss his concerns with her beforehand, which could have prevented the issue. The outcome, with her being grumpy due to lack of sleep and blaming him, shows the negative impact of his decision.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual respect are important. Even if the husband's intent was to ensure her safety, the method he used was inappropriate. He should have addressed his worries through open communication rather than covert tracking.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband's action, while stemming from concern, was a violation of his wife's privacy and trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
