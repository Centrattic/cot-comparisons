She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who tracked their wife's location without her knowledge is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband tracked his wife's phone because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. She came home late, and he used the Android Find My Device feature. She found out and is upset because she feels he didn't trust her. \n\nSo, the main points here are consent and trust. The husband didn't ask her if it was okay to track her phone. Even though he had good intentions (he was worried), tracking someone's location without their permission can be a privacy violation. Privacy is important in relationships, and trust is a big part of that. \n\nHe mentioned that he had used the feature before on his own account and didn't get notifications, thinking she wouldn't find out. But he should have considered that there's a reason apps have alerts for tracking. Maybe he should have communicated his concerns directly instead of using a tracking method. \n\nAlso, when she came home, she was upset because of lack of sleep and blamed him for not trusting her. That indicates that his actions hurt her feelings. Even if he was worried, the method he used to check on her might have been a breach of trust. \n\nHe could have called her more, maybe asked a mutual friend, or gone to her location if he was really worried. Tracking without permission, even with good intentions, can be seen as an asshole move because it infringes on her privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
