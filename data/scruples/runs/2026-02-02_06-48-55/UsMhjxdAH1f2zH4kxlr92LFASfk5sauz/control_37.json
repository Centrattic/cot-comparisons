She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer his calls, and he got worried, so he used the Android Find My Device feature to locate her. The wife found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intent was good\u2014like concern for their safety\u2014it's still a breach of trust. The husband didn't communicate with his wife about his actions, which could lead to feeling disrespected. Privacy is a mutual agreement in relationships, and without consent, this action could be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband was worried. His wife didn't respond to his calls, and he was anxious about her safety in a big city. The lack of communication from her side might have contributed to his decision. However, the right approach would have been to talk about his concerns instead of secretly tracking her. There are other ways to handle the situation, like contacting the friend or waiting for her to return, but he chose an invasive method.\n\nThe wife's reaction is valid. Feeling \"grumpy\" and blaming him for not trusting her shows that this action hurt her feelings. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and secret tracking can damage that. Even if he thought it was for her safety, the method used is problematic. \n\nThe husband might not have realized the implications of his actions until he got caught. But the fact remains that he used a tracking feature without her knowledge, which is a violation of her privacy. The key point here is consent. If he had discussed his concerns with her beforehand and perhaps set up a mutual agreement on how to handle such situations, it might have been different. \n\nSo, while his intent was to ensure her safety, the method he used is ethically questionable. The answer is likely that he is in the wrong (Option A) because of the lack of consent and the breach of privacy, despite the good intentions.\n"
