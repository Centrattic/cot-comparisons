She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the wife went out for dinner with a friend. She told her husband she'd be back by 8 PM. The husband was at his regular's table (maybe a sports bar or something?) and they finished early. He called her, but she didn't pick up, which he thought was normal. He went home, noticed her car wasn't there, called again, no response. Then he did some housework, TV, but by 10 PM, he's worried because she didn't reply to his earlier message about paperwork, even though he saw it was read. At 11 PM, he calls twice, then uses the Android Find My Device feature to track her phone. She came home at midnight, was upset about the lack of sleep and blamed him for not trusting her. The husband is now worried he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is the unauthorized tracking of a spouse's phone. Even if the husband was worried, using the tracking feature without her consent is a privacy invasion. Trust in a relationship is important, so her feeling that he didn't trust her makes sense. He had a valid reason for being concerned\u2014she was late, didn't answer, and they have a routine. But even if the intention was good, accessing her phone's location without asking could be seen as overstepping. \n\nIn many relationships, transparency about such things is expected. If he wanted to track her phone, maybe he should have asked first or discussed having a way to check in. But since he did it without her knowledge, it's likely a breach of trust. The wife's reaction is about feeling untrusted and the invasion of privacy. The husband might argue he was worried, but the action itself is problematic regardless of the reason. So, I think the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
