She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the husband tracked his wife's phone location without her knowledge because she didn't answer his calls and he got worried. The wife found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind his actions. He was worried because his wife didn't come home by 10 pm, which is unusual. He mentions that he tried calling her, sent texts, and eventually used the phone tracking feature. He thought he could do this without her knowing because he didn't get notifications when his phone was tracked. But the wife did get a notification, so she found out.\n\nNow, is tracking her phone without asking a violation of privacy? Even if the intention was concern, accessing someone's location without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Trust is important in a relationship, and even if he was worried, not discussing it with her first might have been a mistake. The wife felt that he didn't trust her, which adds to the tension here. \n\nBut then again, he was genuinely worried. Maybe he didn't realize that tracking her phone would be an issue. However, in most relationships, privacy is a mutual respect thing. Even if it's for safety, the husband should have communicated his concerns and perhaps asked if she wanted to share her location voluntarily. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the wife didn't respond because she was busy or had a bad connection. The husband took it upon himself to track her, which could be seen as overstepping. The key issue here is the lack of communication and consent. Even with good intentions, actions without permission can be problematic.\n\nAlso, the wife was upset about the lack of trust. If he had just kept trying to contact her, maybe he could have avoided the situation. Maybe he should have considered that she might be in a situation where she couldn't respond, but not used tracking without her knowledge. \n\nIn some contexts, using tracking features might be acceptable if there's prior agreement, like if they've set up a way to share locations in emergencies. But if there's no such agreement, then it's a privacy issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action, while coming from a place of concern, was a violation of his wife's privacy without her consent. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
