She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The story says he did this because he was worried when she didn't come home on time. He used a feature called Android Find, which he had tested before without her knowing. But she found out and is upset because he didn't trust her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and privacy. Even if his intentions were good, tracking someone's location without their knowledge is a privacy issue. Trust is a big part of relationships, and this action might have broken that trust. He might have had valid concerns, but the method of checking her location secretly could be seen as a violation of her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, he was worried about her safety, which is understandable. Maybe he didn't think about the fact that she might have her reasons for not answering, like being in a situation where she couldn't. However, the key point here is the lack of communication. Instead of secretly tracking her, he could have talked to her about his concerns or checked in more openly.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She's upset about being tracked and feeling untrusted. Even if she was just out late with a friend, the act of tracking without her knowledge is a breach of trust. There's no guarantee that the tracking was necessary or that she wouldn't have explained herself if he had just asked.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. Using a tracking feature without discussing it first might be seen as an overreaction and a lack of respect for her privacy. So, even though he was worried, the wrongdoer here is likely the husband for invading her privacy without consent, despite his intentions.\n"
