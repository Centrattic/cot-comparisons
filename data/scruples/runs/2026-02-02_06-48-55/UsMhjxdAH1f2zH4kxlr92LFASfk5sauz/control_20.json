She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because his wife didn't answer her calls and was running late. He tracked her phone out of concern for her safety. He mentions he tried calling multiple times and eventually used the \"Find My Device\" feature because he was genuinely worried.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. Did the husband have permission to track his wife? If not, even with good intentions, it's an invasion of privacy. Tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is a breach of trust. Even though his motive was concern, the method without consent is problematic.\n\nAlso, the wife was upset because she felt her privacy was violated. The husband believed he wouldn't be detected, but the fact that she found out and is now upset shows that it caused harm to their relationship. The husband should have communicated his concerns directly rather than resorting to tracking. There might be other ways to address his worries, like having an open conversation about their expectations for communication.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband had a valid reason for being worried, given that his wife didn't respond and was late. However, the ethical aspect here is about respecting boundaries. Even if the action was driven by care, the lack of consent makes it questionable.\n\nIn many relationships, tracking each other's phones without permission is generally considered a no-go. It's a violation of personal space, regardless of the reason. The husband might argue it was out of love, but the wife's reaction indicates that her trust was broken.\n\nSo, weighing the intention against the impact: while the intention was concern for safety, the impact was a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't seek consent and overstepped personal boundaries.\n"
