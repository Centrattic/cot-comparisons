She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked his wife's phone is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband tracked his wife's location using Android's Find My Device. He did this because she was late coming home and he was worried. He didn't tell her beforehand, and she found out later, which made her upset. She felt he didn't trust her.\n\nNow, considering the situation. On one hand, his concern might be genuine. He called and texted, no response, and since they have to get up early, he was worried something might happen. On the other hand, privacy is a big factor here. Using her phone without her knowledge to track her could be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if he had good intentions. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. By tracking her without her consent, he might have breached that trust. Even if he thought it was necessary, the lack of communication and transparency could hurt the relationship. Also, the fact that she was upset and felt blamed for not sleeping might have made things worse. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of his intention. He wasn't trying to be malicious, just worried. However, the method he chose didn't involve her, which might be the issue. Maybe he should have waited a bit longer before taking such action or had a conversation with her about being concerned. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But generally, respecting a person's privacy is important. Unless there's an immediate danger, tracking someone without their knowledge might not be acceptable. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because of privacy violation despite his intentions.\n"
