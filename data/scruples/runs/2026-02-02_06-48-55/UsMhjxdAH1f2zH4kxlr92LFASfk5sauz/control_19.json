She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband called his wife multiple times but didn't get a response. She was supposed to be home by 8 PM but her car wasn't there. He got worried, did housework, watched TV, then started calling more around 10 PM. He used the Android Find My Device feature to track her. She came home late, was grumpy, and now he's worried about being an asshole for doing that. \n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. Even if he was worried, tracking someone's location without their knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust. The wife didn't know he was doing this, and she got a notification about it. That's a problem because she didn't give him permission to track her. \n\nHe mentions that he thought she wouldn't find out because he didn't notice any notifications when he used the feature on his own phone. That shows he wasn't aware that the system would alert her. But even if he didn't mean to, he still went ahead and tracked her without her knowledge. \n\nTrust is important in a relationship. Even if he was concerned for her safety, the way he handled it might have crossed a line. There might be other ways to handle the situation, like calling the friend she was with, or contacting her work. \n\nHe also notes that she's a strong woman who can take care of herself. So maybe his worry was unfounded, or at least could have been addressed differently. Now that she's upset, he needs to take responsibility for his actions. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's privacy is crucial. Even if his intentions were good, the act of tracking her without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). But there are nuances. He was worried, but the method he chose had consequences. The wife's reaction is valid because she expected privacy and felt her autonomy was invaded.\n"
