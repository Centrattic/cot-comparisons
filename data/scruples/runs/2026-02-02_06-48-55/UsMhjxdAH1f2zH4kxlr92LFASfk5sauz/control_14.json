She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone location. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife went out with a friend, told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He called her but she didn't answer, came home, noticed her car wasn't there, tried to reach her, but she didn't respond. He got worried, especially because she didn't reply to a message about important paperwork. Then he used the Android Find My Device feature to locate her phone. He found her in a familiar place but she found out and is upset. She blames him for not trusting her.\n\nNow, the key points here. Privacy is a big factor. Even if his intentions were to check on her safety, accessing her phone's location without her consent could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If he didn't discuss this with her beforehand, it might have made her feel distrusted. He mentions that he thought she wouldn't find out because he used his account, which shows he might have anticipated privacy issues but went ahead anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, he was genuinely worried. She didn't come home when expected, and there's a need for her to be home early. His actions were driven by concern for her safety. However, there are other ways to handle this situation, like checking with her friends or contacting the restaurant to see if she left there. Using tracking without consent, even if it's for safety, crosses a line for many people.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She's upset because she felt her privacy was invaded and that he didn't trust her. Even if he was worried, the method he chose might have been inappropriate. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. So while his intentions were good, the action itself is questionable.\n\nIn many cases, tracking someone's phone without their knowledge is considered a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the intent. The fact that he didn't discuss it with her first suggests he didn't consider her perspective. Even if she was late, there are other ways to address the situation without accessing her phone data. So, the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong because his actions, regardless of intent, violated her privacy and trust without her consent.\n"
