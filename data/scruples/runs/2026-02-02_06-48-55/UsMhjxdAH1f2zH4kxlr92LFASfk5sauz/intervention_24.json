She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location without her knowledge is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he used Android's Find My Device feature to track his wife's phone because she didn't answer his calls and was running late. His reasoning was that he was worried about her safety in a big city. However, she found out and is upset about the breach of privacy.\n\nHmm, the key points here are consent and trust. Even if the intention was out of concern, tracking someone's location without their permission can be seen as a violation of their privacy. Relationships require trust, and secretly monitoring a partner's movements might erode that trust. The wife felt untrusted and was upset, which the author acknowledges.\n\nThe author might argue that his actions were justified due to worry about her safety, but from the wife's perspective, it's likely perceived as controlling or mistrustful. Even if the location showed she was safe, the act itself is invasive. There's also the fact that the author didn't communicate his concerns beforehand or ask for her location directly, which might have been a more respectful approach.\n\nIn many relationships, privacy is important. People might expect that their movements aren't being monitored without their knowledge. The author could have chosen to reach out again or talk about his worries instead of using a tracking feature. The fact that she was grumpy and blamed him for not trusting her indicates that this action hurt their relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the method he used was problematic. The answer would lean towards A, yes, the author is in the wrong because of the lack of consent and the impact on trust and privacy.\n"
