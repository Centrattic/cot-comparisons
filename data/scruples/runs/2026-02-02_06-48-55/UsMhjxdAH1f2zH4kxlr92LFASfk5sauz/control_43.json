She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. So, first, I need to recall the situation. The husband tracked his wife's location because he was worried when she didn't answer his calls and her car wasn't home. He found out later she was mad because she got a notification about her phone being located.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are privacy, trust, and the husband's intent. On one hand, he was worried and wanted to ensure her safety, which is a valid concern. But on the other hand, accessing her phone's location without her consent might be a breach of privacy. Even if his intention was good, the action itself could be seen as an invasion of her privacy. \n\nNow, in relationships, trust is crucial. If the husband didn't trust his wife enough to go to dinner with a friend, that might be an issue. But he mentions she didn't respond to his calls and her car wasn't there, which made him anxious. However, maybe there were other ways to handle it, like contacting her friend or checking with her workplace. \n\nAlso, the fact that he used an Android feature to track her suggests he did it without her knowledge, which is a red flag. Even if he thought she wouldn't notice, the act of tracking someone without their consent is generally considered wrong. The wife's reaction is understandable because she felt her privacy was violated. \n\nBut I should consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, people might have different views on privacy and surveillance in relationships. However, in most modern discussions, consent is key. The husband didn't ask for permission, so even if his motives were good, the method was inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle: the wife had previously agreed to meet with a friend, which is normal. The husband's reaction might indicate a lack of trust, leading to the wife feeling untrusted. The consequence is that she's upset, not only because of the tracking but also because she had to stay up late and was grumpy. \n\nSo, putting it all together. The husband's action was a breach of trust and privacy, even if his intention was concern for her safety. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
