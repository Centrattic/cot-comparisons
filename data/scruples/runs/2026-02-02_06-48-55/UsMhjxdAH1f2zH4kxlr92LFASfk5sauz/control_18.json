She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The scenario is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband got worried and used the phone's location feature. She found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the husband had good intentions, using the phone's location without her consent is a privacy violation. Most people would see this as an invasion of their personal space. The fact that he didn't receive a notification before suggests he might have bypassed her settings, which is a problem.\n\nThen there's the context. He was worried because she didn't answer and came home late. But that doesn't justify tracking her. Trust is important in relationships, and actions like this can erode it. Even if she's a strong woman, the husband's actions might make her feel distrusted.\n\nHe mentioned he needed her to revisit paperwork, and she read the message but didn't reply. Maybe he should have followed up differently instead of tracking her. Also, the wife was upset about not getting sleep and blamed him, which indicates the action caused conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, he was genuinely worried. But there are other ways to handle worry, like contacting friends or authorities. Using the location feature without consent seems to overstep boundaries regardless of intention.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action, while coming from concern, is an invasion of privacy and breaches trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
