She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone location. The situation is that he got worried when she didn't come home on time, tried her repeatedly, then used the Android Find feature to check her location. She found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because she didn't answer her phone and her car wasn't home. He tried calling multiple times and sent messages. He mentions that she had previously said she'd be back by 8, but she came home at 12:30. He used the tracking feature because he was genuinely concerned about her safety in a big city. He thought she wouldn't notice because he had used it on his own account before without alerts.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and trust. Using someone's phone without their permission, even for concern, is a privacy issue. Even if his intention was to ensure her safety, accessing her location without her knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust. In many relationships, mutual trust is crucial, and such actions can erode that trust. If he had been concerned, a better approach might have been to reach out more persistently or contact someone else she was with. Using tracking without consent, even if well-intentioned, can come off as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. So, while his intentions were to check on her safety, the method was problematic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA, meaning he's in the wrong for not respecting her privacy despite his concern.\n"
