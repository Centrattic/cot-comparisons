She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone.\n\nFirst, the author explains that their wife went out with a friend and was supposed to be back by 8 pm. When she didn't answer the call and her car wasn't home, they got worried. They tried calling again, sent messages, and eventually used the phone's location feature because they were concerned. They found her at a familiar place, which made them feel better. However, the wife found out and is upset, feeling that her trust was violated.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy. The author used a feature that tracks the wife's phone without her knowledge. Even though their intention was concern and worry, accessing someone's location without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and actions that undermine it can cause significant distress, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was genuinely worried. They tried other methods first (calling, texting) and only used the location tracking as a last resort. The wife did mark the message about the paperwork as read but didn't respond, which might have added to the author's anxiety. However, the lack of prior communication about the location tracking feature is a problem. The author didn't discuss or get permission for using such a feature, which is a key factor here.\n\nAnother point is the wife's reaction. She felt that the author didn't trust her, which is a valid feeling. Even if the author's actions were based on concern, the method of checking her location without her knowledge can be seen as controlling or invasive. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's privacy and autonomy.\n\nThe author might argue that their actions were out of love and worry, but the ethical aspect here is about consent and transparency. Without discussing and agreeing on such a feature, using it without the other person's knowledge can indeed be considered a breach of trust. The wife's right to privacy is important, and the author's actions, regardless of intent, violated that.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because they used a method that invades their wife's privacy without her consent, even if the motivation was concern. The right approach would have been to communicate their worries openly and perhaps have a conversation about how they can ensure safety without compromising trust.\n"
