She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who tracked their wife's location is in the wrong. So first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe husband tracked his wife's phone because he was worried when she didn't show up on time. He tried calling her multiple times but got no response. He mentioned they live in a big city, so his concern might be valid. He used a feature he thought wouldn't alert her, but she found out and is upset. \n\nOn the other hand, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was to ensure her safety, it's a breach of trust. The wife felt untrusted and was upset about it. The husband thought he was being cautious, but the method he used was intrusive.\n\nI should also think about whether there were other options. Maybe he could have contacted her friend or called the police if he was that worried. But he did check the location and found she was safe. Still, the act itself is problematic because of the lack of consent. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the husband had good intentions, the action of tracking without asking might be seen as a violation. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because of the privacy breach despite his intentions.\n"
