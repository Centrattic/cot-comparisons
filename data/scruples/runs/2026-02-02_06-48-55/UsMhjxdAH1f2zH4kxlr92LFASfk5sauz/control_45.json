She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband's wife went out for dinner with a female friend. She told him she'd be back by 8pm, but she didn't answer his call when he got home early. He noticed her car wasn't there, tried calling again, but no response. He waited until 10pm, then 10:30, and finally at 11pm, when he got worried, he used a tracking feature on her Android phone. The wife found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her. She came home at midnight and was grumpy the next day.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, privacy, and communication. The husband's actions were motivated by worry, but the method he used was secret. Even though he had a concern, tracking her phone without telling her is a privacy issue. The wife felt that her privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern. \n\nI should consider if using a tracking feature without her consent is a breach of trust. Even if his intention was to ensure her safety, the lack of communication beforehand is a problem. Maybe he should have discussed his worries with her and asked if she was okay with being tracked. The fact that he used her phone's tracking feature and didn't inform her before might have been a mistake, regardless of his intentions. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is understandable. She might feel that her autonomy is respected, and being tracked without her knowledge could make her feel like he doesn't trust her. The husband's reasoning is that he was worried, but the question is whether his actions were wrong. In most cases, privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if it's for safety, using a tracking method that the wife wasn't aware of could be seen as an asshole move. \n\nOn the other hand, he was concerned because she was late and didn't answer her phone. But the mistake was in not talking to her about setting up tracking first. Maybe if he had a mutual agreement about using tracking for emergencies, it would be different. However, since he did it without her consent, it's a privacy violation. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The action was a privacy breach, even if well-intentioned. The wife's trust is important, and the husband should have communicated better instead of tracking her secretly. The outcome shows that she was upset, which indicates that the move was indeed wrong in the context of their relationship.\n"
