She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe husband's wife went out to dinner with a friend and said she'd be back by 8. He called her but she didn't pick up. He got home, noticed her car wasn't there, tried contacting her again, but no luck. After waiting till 10, then 11, he got worried and used her phone's location tracking. He found out her location, but she found out and was upset. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent. Using someone's phone without their permission is a big no-no. Even if he was worried, he didn't ask. Privacy is important, and tracking someone's location without their knowledge breaches that trust. He might have thought it was okay because he was worried, but that doesn't make it right. The fact that he didn't inform her beforehand is key here. \n\nAlso, the wife felt that he didn't trust her. Trust in a relationship is crucial. By tracking her, he might have undermined her trust in him. Even if she was late, there are other ways to handle it: maybe call again, leave a message, or wait. Tracking her location without consent could be seen as invasive. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of his concern for her safety. He mentioned it's a big city, so his worry is understandable. However, the method he used was the problem. Instead of tracking, he could have tried reaching out more or maybe asked their mutual friends if she was okay. \n\nThe wife didn't respond to his previous message about the paperwork, so maybe there was some communication issue already. But that doesn't justify the tracking. The main issue here is about respecting her privacy versus his concern. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries matter. If he didn't have her permission, then he overstepped. Even if his intentions were good, the action itself was a violation of her privacy. The answer here would likely be that he was wrong because he didn't have consent and acted without considering her autonomy. The answer is A.\n"
