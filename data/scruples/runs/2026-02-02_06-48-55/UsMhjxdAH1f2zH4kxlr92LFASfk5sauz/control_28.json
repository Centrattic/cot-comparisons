She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for tracking their wife's location via her phone. The story is that the wife went out with a friend, didn't answer calls, and the husband, worried, used the phone's location tracking without her knowledge. The wife found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because his wife didn't come home when expected and didn't respond to calls. He used a feature that allowed him to track her phone. The key issue here is consent. Did he have the right to track her phone without her knowing? \n\nIn many relationships, privacy is important. Even if his intention was to check on her safety, using a tracking feature without her knowledge could be seen as a violation of her privacy. The husband might argue that he was worried and had a right to ensure her safety, but the wife likely expected her privacy to be respected. \n\nAlso, the husband mentioned that he didn't think she would find out because he checked on his own account before. That shows he might have been aware that tracking could be a privacy issue, but he proceeded anyway. \n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable. She felt that her trust was broken. The husband's actions, while coming from a place of concern, might not have considered her right to privacy. Even if the outcome was okay (she was safe), the act itself was secretive and non-consensual. \n\nIn some cases, mutual agreements about phone access might exist, but there's no indication here that such an agreement was in place. Therefore, the husband's action could be seen as overstepping, making him at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he tracked her phone without her consent, which is a privacy violation, even if his intentions were good.\n"
