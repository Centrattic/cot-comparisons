She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about tracking his wife's phone location without her knowledge. He did this because he was worried when she didn't come home on time. But she found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons. He was worried about her safety, right? The wife went out with a friend, and he wasn't sure why she didn't answer or come home. He tried calling and texting, but she didn't respond. Then he used the Android Find feature to check her location. It showed she was in a familiar place, so he thought she was safe. But she got a notification and was mad because he didn't trust her. \n\nNow, the question is whether his actions were wrong. Well, tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intention was to check on her safety, it's a breach of trust. The wife felt that he didn't trust her, which is a valid feeling. People have a right to privacy, even in relationships. Maybe there's a better way to handle situations where someone is concerned about their partner's safety, like having an open conversation about it instead of using tracking features.\n\nBut on the other hand, he was genuinely worried. He tried contacting her multiple times. The problem is that he resorted to tracking without discussing it with her first. In a healthy relationship, trust and communication are key. If he had expressed his concerns to her, maybe they could have found another solution. By tracking her, even with good intentions, he undermined her privacy and possibly her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the wife was upset because she felt blamed and not trusted. That could damage their relationship. So, even if his actions were out of concern, the method was inappropriate. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because he violated her privacy without consent, even if the motive was to ensure her safety. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that he's not the asshole because he was worried and acted out of love. However, the consensus usually is that privacy matters, and such actions without consent are a no-go. So the answer is likely A.\n"
