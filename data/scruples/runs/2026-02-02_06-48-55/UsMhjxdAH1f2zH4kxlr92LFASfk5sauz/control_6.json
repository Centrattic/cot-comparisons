She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife went out to dinner with a friend, and the husband tracked her location through her phone because he got worried when she didn't come home on time. Now she's upset because he did that without her consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was worried because she didn't answer his calls, wasn't home by the expected time, and he had to file some paperwork. He mentioned he used the Android Find My Device feature, which he thought wouldn't notify her. But she found out and is angry. She's blaming him for not trusting her, even though he says he was just worried.\n\nI know that tracking someone's location without their permission is generally a privacy issue. Even if the intention was to care or be cautious, violating someone's privacy can be seen as a breach of trust. The wife feels her privacy was invaded, and that's a significant point. Even if the husband had good intentions, the action itself was unauthorized. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The husband's actions, while stemming from concern, might have undermined the trust she has in him. The fact that she was upset about being tracked, even after coming home, suggests that the method he used was problematic. He didn't communicate his concerns to her directly before taking action. Maybe if he had called her again, left a message, or reached out to her friend, he could have found out where she was without invading her privacy.\n\nAlso, the husband thought he wouldn't get noticed, but since the app is designed to alert users when their phone is being located, that's a flaw in his reasoning. He should have known there's a possibility she might find out. The key issue here is consent. He used her phone's tracking feature without asking her, which is a privacy violation regardless of the reason.\n\nOn the other hand, his intention was worry and concern for her safety, which is understandable. But the means he used might not be acceptable. It's a balance between reasonable concern and respecting her privacy. There might be better ways to handle such situations without tracking someone. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that using tracking without consent is wrong, even if the motive is good. The wife's reaction is valid because privacy matters, and she might feel that her autonomy was disrespected. Even if he was just trying to help, the method was inappropriate. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he violated her privacy without her consent, even if his intentions were good.\n"
