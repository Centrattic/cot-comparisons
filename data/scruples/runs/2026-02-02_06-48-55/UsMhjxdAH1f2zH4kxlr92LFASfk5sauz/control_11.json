She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for tracking his wife's phone. The situation is that she went out with a female friend, didn't answer his calls, and he got worried. He used the Android Find My Device feature to check her location. She came home late, was grumpy, and he's wondering if he was an asshole.\n\nFirst, consider the intent. He was worried because she didn't answer his calls and wasn't home when expected. He had a legitimate reason to be concerned, given it's a big city. His action was to check her location via her phone, which he had access to via his account. \n\nBut here's the catch: tracking someone's phone without their consent is a privacy issue. Even if the intent was concern, it's a violation of their privacy. The wife was understandably upset because she didn't know he was tracking her. In a healthy relationship, trust and communication are key. Instead of secretly tracking her, he should have talked to her or asked others if they knew where she was. \n\nAlso, he mentions that he didn't think she'd find out, which shows he might have been aware that this wasn't something she'd agree to. The fact that she felt betrayed and blamed him for not trusting her indicates that his actions caused harm to their relationship. \n\nEven though his intention was out of worry, the act itself is a breach of trust. So, while he might not be an \"asshole,\" he made a mistake by not respecting her privacy. The answer likely is A (the author is in the wrong) because he violated her privacy despite good intentions.\n"
