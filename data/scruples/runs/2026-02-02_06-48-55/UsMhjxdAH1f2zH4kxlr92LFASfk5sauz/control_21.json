She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who tracked his wife's location via her phone is in the wrong. The situation involves him checking her location when she didn't come home on time. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, he mentions that his wife went out with a female friend, told him she'd be back by 8 PM. He finished his dinner early, called her but she didn't pick up. Then he went home, noticed her car wasn't there. He waited, did some stuff, then tried texting and calling again. When she didn't respond, he used Android's Find My Device to check her location. She found out, got mad, and now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did he have a valid reason to track her? He was worried because she didn't come home on time, didn't answer his calls. He thought something might have happened. But tracking her without her consent is a privacy issue. Even if his intentions were good, the act of tracking without permission can be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the husband's actions were out of concern, using a tracking feature without prior agreement or her knowledge is a problem. The wife felt that he didn't trust her, which led to her anger. She might have expected open communication instead of him checking her phone. There's a balance between concern and respecting privacy. \n\nHe could have tried other steps first, like contacting her friend to see if there's an update, or maybe waiting a bit longer. Using the tracking feature without her consent, even if it was accessible through his account, wasn't the right approach. The fact that he didn't think she'd notice shows a lack of consideration for her privacy. \n\nSo, while his intentions were to ensure her safety, the method he used was inappropriate. The answer here is likely that he's in the wrong because privacy matters, and the way he acted without discussing it first damaged trust. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
