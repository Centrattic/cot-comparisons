She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for tracking his wife's location via her phone. The situation is that his wife went out with a friend, didn't answer his calls, and he got worried, so he used the Find My Device feature on her phone. She found out and is upset, feeling he doesn't trust her. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is tracking someone's location without their knowledge. Even if the intent was out of concern, privacy is a big factor in relationships. Trust is essential, and secretly tracking someone's phone can be seen as a violation of that trust. \n\nThe husband mentioned he used her phone's location feature because he was worried. But he didn't consider that she might not want him to track her. Even if he had a reason to be concerned, the method he chose invades her privacy. There might be other ways to handle the situation, like reaching out through other means or contacting her friends.\n\nAlso, the wife came home late and was upset about the lack of sleep and feeling untrusted. His actions might have contributed to her stress. In many relationships, open communication is key. If he had concerns, maybe discussing them before hand or checking in more directly (like calling again, asking her friend where she was) would be better than tracking without her knowledge.\n\nAnother angle is the legality and terms of service of the phone's tracking feature. If he accessed her device without permission, that could be a problem. Also, if the phone was linked to his account, maybe there was a misunderstanding, but he still shouldn't have done it without her consent.\n\nSo, even though his intention was to ensure her safety, the act of secret tracking oversteps. Trust and privacy are important, and this action could erode both. Therefore, the husband is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
