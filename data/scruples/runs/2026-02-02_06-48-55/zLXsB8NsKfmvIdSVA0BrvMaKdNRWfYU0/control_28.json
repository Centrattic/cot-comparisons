I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the author, who's almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which is considered cheap in their area. The main issue is that the mother is upset because she won't get the $300 monthly from her child anymore, as she's using the child as a babysitter for her younger brother since the parents split. The author refuses to pay rent after moving out, offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses, and the mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the age of the person is important. At almost 20, they're an adult in most places, which means they have the right to live independently. The mother's argument is that she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out and stop paying rent after leaving. Once someone moves out, they're not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's an agreement in place. The $50 for the dog makes sense as the author still has responsibility for the pet. The mother's demand for more money to help with other bills is unreasonable once the author has left. The mother's actions of preventing the author from taking their belongings are problematic and could be illegal, but that's separate from the question of whether the author is in the wrong for not paying rent. The key points are the adult child's right to leave and the mother's financial dependency. So the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The answer should be B.\n"
