I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out at almost 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she's losing the rent money and using the author as a babysitter since the parents split. The author is not paying rent anymore, offering $50 a month for the dog instead, and the mom is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and moral aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a prior agreement. The author is an adult and in a new living arrangement, so they're not required to continue paying. The mom's argument that she can't afford babysitting is her problem, not the author's. The author is also taking responsibility by contributing to the dog's care, which is fair since they own the dog.\n\nThe mom's actions, like trying to block the author from taking their belongings, are problematic. Legally, the author owns their stuff and can't be prevented from removing it. The mom might be acting out of anger or financial distress, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author is within their rights to call the cops for a civil standby.\n\nMoral considerations: The author's reasons for moving out are valid\u2014needing their own space, relationship, and escaping an unfair babysitting role. The mom's treating the rent as a financial gain rather than supporting her child's independence is questionable. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and life after becoming an adult.\n\nThe $50 for the dog is a reasonable gesture, showing the author still cares but isn't liable for the mom's financial issues. The mom's anger and attempts to block the move are more about her losing income than the author's actions being wrong. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
