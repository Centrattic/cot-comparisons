I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out of the mom's house because the mom is treating the user like a babysitter. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent. The user plans to move in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. The user is giving $50 a month for the dog's expenses but not more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a formal agreement. The user is moving out, so they're not bound by any ongoing financial responsibility unless they had a written agreement. The mom's anger seems to stem from losing the financial support, but the user isn't required to continue payments after moving out.\n\nEthically, the user is seeking independence and trying to escape an unfair situation where they're acting as a babysitter. The mom's behavior\u2014being livid and trying to block the user from taking their belongings\u2014shows control and possibly misuse of the financial arrangement. The user's decision to pay for the dog's care is generous, given they can't take the pet. The mom's demands for more money after the user moves out don't seem justified, especially since the user has their own bills.\n\nThe mom's actions in trying to prevent the user from taking their belongings could be a legal issue. The user might have a right to their possessions, and calling the police for a civil standby is a reasonable step if the mom is blocking access. So the user isn't in the wrong for asserting their rights here.\n\nPutting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision to move out and are not legally or ethically obligated to continue financial support after leaving. The mom's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
