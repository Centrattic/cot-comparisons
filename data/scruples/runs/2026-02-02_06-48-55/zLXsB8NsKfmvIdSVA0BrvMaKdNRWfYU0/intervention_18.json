I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The mom is upset because she was using the author to watch the brother a few nights a week, and now she's angry about losing the $300. The author is giving $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom is demanding more, which the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a legal or moral obligation to continue paying rent after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they are no longer responsible for the rent of another person's residence. So the author isn't in the wrong there. The mom might have been using the author as a live-in babysitter, implying an informal agreement, but once the author moves out, that arrangement ends. The author isn't obligated to continue financial support beyond what was agreed.\n\nThe mom's reaction seems to be based on her own financial planning, which she adjusted to include the author's supposed rent. However, that's not the author's responsibility anymore. The author is also standing up for their own needs, wanting to move out and have a relationship. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but it's reasonable that the author doesn't want to pay more. The mom's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is problematic and potentially illegal, which might require police intervention.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They are asserting their independence, and the mom's demands are unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
