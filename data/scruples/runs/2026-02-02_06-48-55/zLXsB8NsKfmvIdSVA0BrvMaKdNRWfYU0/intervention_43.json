I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out at almost 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which is a good deal. The author wants to leave because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from the author anymore. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses to pay more for other bills. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a formal agreement. The author isn't staying in the house, so they shouldn't have to pay rent there. The $300 was for the new place, so that's separate. The mom is upset about losing income, but that's not the author's responsibility. However, the author is offering $50 for the dog, which they took care of while living there. That's being reasonable. The mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff, which is illegal because the author owns them. \n\nEthically, the author has a point about wanting independence and not being treated as a babysitter. The mom's reaction of being livid and trying to block the move seems excessive. But the question is about being in the wrong. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They are also not in the wrong for not helping with other bills since they're moving out. The mom's demands beyond the dog's expenses are unreasonable. The author is handling their own responsibilities now. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have considered the mom's situation more, but the mom's behavior seems to be the root problem. The author is taking steps to become independent, which is a normal part of adulthood. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
