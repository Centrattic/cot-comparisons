I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is moving out of their mom's house because they've been acting as a babysitter since the parents split. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and wants help with other bills. The person is offering $50 a month for the dog's care but not more.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person is in the wrong. The key points here are the legal and ethical responsibilities. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The person is moving to a new place and paying rent there, so refusing to pay their mom's bills seems reasonable. The mom's financial situation and needing help with the brother's childcare isn't the person's responsibility anymore once they move out. However, the person is offering to help with the dog's expenses, which is a nice gesture but not required. The mom's reaction of trying to block the person from taking their belongings is problematic and might be illegal, so the person might have a right to involve the police.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. From the analysis, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not legally obligated to pay their mom after moving out. The mom's anger and attempts to prevent the person from taking their belongings are on her. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
