I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's almost 20, wants to move out and is refusing to pay rent once they leave. Their mom is upset because she was using them as a babysitter for their brother and now is upset about losing the $300 rent. The author is giving $50 a month for the dog's care and is taking their stuff, but the mom is blocking them and calling the cops. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the basics: moving out is a person's right once they're an adult. The author isn't a child anymore, so they aren't obligated to pay rent after moving out. The mom was using them as a babysitter, which isn't fair. The author is taking their belongings, which they own, so the mom can't legally stop them. The $50 for the dog is reasonable since the author owns the dog. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for not paying rent after moving out. Since they're moving out, they don't owe rent anymore. The mom's reaction is about her losing income, but that's not the author's responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own life and independence. So the answer should be B.\n"
