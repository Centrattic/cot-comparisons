I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 and is using that money to cover the cost of babysitting her younger son. The author offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refused to pay more. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the core issue is whether the author is obligated to continue paying rent to their mom after moving out. Typically, once someone moves out, they are no longer responsible for paying the parent's rent unless there's a prior agreement. The author was contributing $300 before, but that was when they were living under the same roof. Now, they're moving out, so the financial arrangement should change. The mom is using the $300 to cover babysitting costs, which isn't the author's responsibility anymore. \n\nThe author is in their right to refuse paying more since they are moving out. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, not the author's well-being. The author's offer to help with the dog's expenses is reasonable and shows some consideration. However, the mom is being unreasonable by trying to block the author from taking their belongings. Legally, the author can retrieve their possessions, and the cops can help if necessary. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to pay, so they aren't in the wrong. The mom is the one acting wrong by not allowing the move and trying to withhold belongings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
