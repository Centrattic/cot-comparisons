I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which sounds affordable. The main reason they want to move out is because their mom has been acting like they're a live-in babysitter for their brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The person refuses to pay her more than $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is blocking them from taking their stuff, so they might need to call the cops.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLet's break it down. Legally, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving into a new place where they pay rent there, so they aren't responsible for their mom's bills anymore. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300, but that's her responsibility now. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. They also offer $50 for the dog, which is a gesture but not required. The mom's actions of blocking the author from taking their belongings are problematic. Legally, the author owns their things, and the mom can't prevent that. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels they were overburdened with childcare duties and want independence. The mom seems to be using the brother's care as a reason to keep the author, but that's not the author's responsibility once they move out. The mom's reaction is more about financial loss than the brother's wellbeing. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to move out, stop paying rent, and set boundaries. The mom's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
