I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which seems affordable. The main reasons for moving out are the mom treating them like a babysitter for their younger brother after the parents' divorce. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent and now has to manage without that income to help with her other responsibilities. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's care because they can't take the dog with them. The mom demands more money and is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is moving out, the mom is upset about losing the rent money, and the author isn't continuing to pay rent because they're not living there anymore. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent for the previous residence unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving into a new place with a different rent arrangement. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to live independently. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the mom is demanding more, which the author isn't required to do. The mom's actions of trying to prevent the author from taking their things might be the bigger issue here, possibly involving legal matters like property rights.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is moving out and isn't required to pay rent to their former residence, they aren't in the wrong. The mom's behavior (calling them names, trying to block their belongings) is problematic, but the author's refusal to pay rent post-move is justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
