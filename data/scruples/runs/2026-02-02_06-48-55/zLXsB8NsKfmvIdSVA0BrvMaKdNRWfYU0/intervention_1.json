I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out of their mom's house because they feel overburdened by taking care of their younger brother since the parents split. The mom is upset and trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. When you move out, you are no longer obligated to pay rent to your parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author isn't in a rental situation anymore; they're leaving their own home. So legally, they don't owe rent. The mom might be treating the author as a tenant, but that's not the case here. The author is removing their belongings, which they own, so the mom can't legally stop them. The part about the dog is interesting. Since the dog is still the mom's, the author isn't responsible for her bills beyond what they agreed to. \n\nMorally, the situation is more complex. The author feels they've been overworking as a babysitter, and the mom is using the brother's care as a reason to keep the author. The mom's reaction seems to be about financial loss rather than the children's well-being. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the part where the author says they won't pay more than $50 for the dog might be seen as cutting ties, which could be justified. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't required to pay rent after moving out, the mom is using emotional manipulation, and the author is trying to protect their own financial interests. The mom's actions (trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings) are problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B makes sense.\n"
