I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out at almost 20 to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she was getting $300 from them as rent, which she used to help with the brother's care. Now, the person is saying they won't pay rent anymore, and the mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out of their parents' house, they're no longer obligated to pay rent unless they were a tenant there. Since this was their mom's house and they were likely living under their parent's roof before moving out, there's no legal obligation to pay rent. So the person isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nThen there's the emotional manipulation part. The mom is upset because she's using the $300 to cover childcare costs. However, the person moving out to be with their partner and friends is a personal choice. The mom's reliance on the child for childcare might be an issue here. The person is trying to establish independence, which is reasonable. \n\nThe person is also being fair by offering $50 for the dog's expenses, showing some consideration. The mom's threat to block them from their belongings is a red flag. That's not acceptable, and the person is right to consider legal action like a civil standby.\n\nSo, the key points are: legal obligation doesn't apply after moving out, the person is being reasonable in their offer for the dog, and the mom is acting inconsiderate by trying to prevent them from their belongings. The person isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
