I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The mom is upset because she was getting that $300 as \"rent,\" but the author isn't actually staying in the house anymore. The mom is treating the author as a babysitter since the parents split, and the author wants to move out for that reason. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, legally, when you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent unless you have a lease agreement. Since the author is moving out, they're not required to pay any more money. The mom might have been using the $300 as a kind of contribution towards household expenses, but once the author leaves, that arrangement is over. The author is being clear that they're moving out and not continuing the financial arrangement. The mom's reaction of being angry and trying to block the author from taking their stuff is the real issue here. The author is within their rights to not pay and to seek help from the police if needed to retrieve their belongings. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
