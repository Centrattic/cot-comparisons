I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out of their mom's house, moving in with a boyfriend and friends, and the mom being upset about not receiving the $300 rent. The mom is using the money as a babysitter for the brother, and when the person refuses to continue paying, the mom is angry and even trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parent unless there's a formal agreement. The scenario mentions that the person was paying $300 per month in rent before moving out, but now they're moving out and not continuing to pay. The mom is upset because she's using that money for childcare, but ethically, is it the adult child's responsibility to continue contributing once they've moved out?\n\nThe person argues that they have their own bills to pay and can't continue supporting their mom financially. The mom is in a difficult situation post-divorce, relying on the child's rent for childcare. However, the adult child is making a choice to prioritize their own independence and relationships. The author mentions they bought their own stuff and might need to call the police to retrieve their belongings, which is a legal matter about property rights.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the mom's situation is challenging, the adult child has a right to independence. The original agreement was rent in exchange for living in the house, which no longer applies once they've moved out. The mom's expectation of continued financial support after the child has left might be unrealistic. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since they were already paying rent and now are choosing to live independently. The mom's attempt to block the child from their belongings is problematic, indicating an overreach on her part.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the child has a moral obligation to help their parent, especially given the family context. But in many cases, adults moving out are expected to be self-sufficient. The key points are the legal right to leave, the end of the rental agreement, and the parent's refusal to respect the child's independence. The author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay after moving out.\n"
