I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out at almost 20, into a place with a boyfriend and friends where rent is $300 per person. The main reason for moving out is that the mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and is now trying to block the person from taking their stuff.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to analyze this step by step. First, legal age of majority. In the US, that's 18, so the person is above that. Moving out is their right. The mom was using the rent to cover babysitting costs, but once the person moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent anymore. The mom's demand for more money after the move is probably unreasonable. The person offered $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable because they're still responsible for the dog. The mom is now blocking access to the person's belongings, which is a legal issue. The person might need to involve the police to reclaim their property, which they have a right to.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not obligated to pay rent once they've moved out. The mom's demands are outside what's reasonable. The person is standing up for themselves, which is justified. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
