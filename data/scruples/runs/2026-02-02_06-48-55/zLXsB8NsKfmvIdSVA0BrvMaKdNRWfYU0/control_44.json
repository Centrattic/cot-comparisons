I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to be with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore, which she was using as a babysitter for the brother. \n\nFirst, the author isn't legally obligated to pay rent once they've moved out. When you move out, your responsibility to pay rent to the landlord ends. The mom isn't the landlord here; she's the parent. So the author isn't in the wrong by not continuing to pay her. The mom's anger seems misplaced because she was using the rent as a form of support, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nThe author offered $50 for the dog's expenses, which shows they're trying to be considerate. The mom's demand for more money is unfair. The author has their own bills to pay, so refusing is reasonable. Also, the mom is now trying to block the author from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. The author might need legal help, but that doesn't make them wrong for not paying.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
