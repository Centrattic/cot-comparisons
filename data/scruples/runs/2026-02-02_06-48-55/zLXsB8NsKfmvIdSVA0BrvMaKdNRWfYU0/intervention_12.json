I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason they want to move out is that their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter for their brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 a month anymore and can't afford to pay someone else for the babysitting. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more money and is now trying to prevent them from taking their stuff.\n\nSo, the key points here: the person is an adult moving out, the mom is using them as childcare, and now she's upset about losing that financial support. The question is about whether the person is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out.\n\nHmm. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parent unless they have a specific agreement. The person is now living in a different place, so the original arrangement (living at home for free in exchange for childcare) is no longer in effect. The mom's anger seems to be about the loss of financial benefit, not about the person needing to move out for personal reasons. The person is also trying to help with the dog expenses, which shows some consideration, even if the mom isn't satisfied.\n\nThe mom's reaction of trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings is problematic. That's where the legal issue might come in. The person might need to involve authorities to retrieve their property, which is their right. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, once you move out, you're not responsible for the parent's financial situation. The person is making a choice to live independently, which is a common step in adulthood. The mom's reliance on the child for childcare is a separate issue, but the person isn't obligated to continue that once they've moved out.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They're exercising their right to independence, and the mom's demands are unreasonable after the move-out. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
