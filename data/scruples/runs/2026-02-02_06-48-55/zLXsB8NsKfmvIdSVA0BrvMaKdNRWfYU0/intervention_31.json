I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, the author is 19 and moving out. They've informed their mom, who's upset because she was expecting rent money. The mom was using the author as a babysitter since the parents split. The author wants to move out to be with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The author refuses to pay rent after moving out, offers $50/month for the dog's care, and the mom is now blocking them from taking their belongings.\n\nThe key points here: Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a legal agreement. The author is not at fault for not continuing to pay rent post-move. The mom's expectation might be based on a misunderstanding or emotional manipulation. The author is also handling their own responsibilities now. The mom's actions of preventing the author from taking their stuff are problematic. The $50 offer for the dog is reasonable, but the mom's demand for more is her issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. So the answer should be B.\n"
