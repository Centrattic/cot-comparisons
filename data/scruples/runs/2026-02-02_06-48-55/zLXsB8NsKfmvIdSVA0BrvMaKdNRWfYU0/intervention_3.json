I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The author is 19, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems cheap. The main reason for moving out is that the mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she loses the $300, and she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author offers $50 for the dog's food and grooming but refuses to help with other bills. The mom is now blocking their stuff, leading the author to consider calling the cops.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: When someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay their parents' bills unless there's a prior agreement. The author is not responsible for their mom's expenses once they're independent. The mom's anger seems more about financial loss than actual need. The author is setting boundaries, which is positive. However, the mom's claim about not being able to afford childcare is a red flag. Maybe the author was acting as a free babysitter, and the mom is now struggling without that. The author's offer to help with the dog is reasonable, but other bills aren't their responsibility. The mom's actions in blocking belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, so the author might need to involve authorities. Overall, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The mom's behavior is more at fault here.\n"
