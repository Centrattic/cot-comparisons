I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason for moving out is that the mom is treating them like a babysitter for the younger brother since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300, and she can't afford care for the brother. The author refuses to pay more than $50 for the dog, and the mom is blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's a specific agreement. The author isn't living there anymore, so the rent they paid in their new place isn't related to their mom's expenses. The mom's financial situation is her own responsibility now that the author has left.\n\nThe $50 for the dog seems reasonable since they're still the owner. But the mom's demands for more money are pushing beyond what's fair. The author has their own bills to pay, so they can't help beyond that. The mom's anger about losing the $300 is about her own financial loss, not the author's responsibility.\n\nThe mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings. Legally, the author owns their stuff, so the mom can't stop them. They might need legal help to retrieve their belongings, which is a red flag for the mom's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying their mom's bills after moving out. The mom is the one acting inconsiderately by expecting financial support from her adult child. The author's actions are about setting boundaries after being mistreated.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
