I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she was getting the money as if it were rent, but the person is moving out.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out, so the arrangement of paying her mom for rent while living at home is ending. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300, but the person is not obligated to continue paying once they're no longer living under the same roof. The person is also contributing $50 for the dog's expenses, which seems reasonable since they own the dog. The mom is demanding more money for other bills, but the person has their own expenses to handle.\n\nThe mom's actions of trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings are problematic. Legally, the person owns their stuff, so the mom can't stop them from retrieving it. The person might need to involve the police to do a civil standby, which is a valid step if the mom is being uncooperative and obstructing.\n\nThe mom's argument that she can't afford to watch the brother is her issue, not the person's. The person was helping out, but now they're moving out, and the responsibility shifts back to the mom. The person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and moving out, especially since they were using the money for their own living expenses while at home. Now that they're independent, they don't owe the mom anything beyond what they've agreed to (the $50 for the dog).\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to move out and stop paying rent, and the mom's actions are unreasonable.\n"
