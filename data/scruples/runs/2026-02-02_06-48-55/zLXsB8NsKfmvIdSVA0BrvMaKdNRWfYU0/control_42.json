I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They were supposed to move out, and their mom was upset because she was losing the $300 rent. The person also mentioned they have to leave their dog behind, which their mom still has. The mom is now trying to keep their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're generally not obligated to pay rent anymore unless there's a lease agreement that binds them. Since the person is moving out, it's their right to stop paying. The mom was using the money as a substitute for babysitting, but that wasn't a formal agreement. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The person felt used by their mom, acting as a babysitter while the mom had other commitments. The decision to move out is about reclaiming their independence. The mom's reaction is over the financial loss, which seems self-centered. \n\nThe person offered $50 for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable if they want to maintain some responsibility. But the mom is demanding more money for other bills, which the person can't afford. The mom's threats to keep their belongings are problematic. Legally, people can't prevent someone from taking their own property, so calling the cops for a civil standby makes sense here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person isn't at fault for stopping rent payments. The mom is acting out of self-interest and not respecting the person's need to leave. The person's actions are justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
