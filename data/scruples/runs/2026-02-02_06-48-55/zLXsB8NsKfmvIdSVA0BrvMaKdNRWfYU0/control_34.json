I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The main points are that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 and is treating the kid like a babysitter since the parents split. The kid is giving $50 for the dog's food and grooming. The mom is trying to stop them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is obligated to pay rent after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't responsible for rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The mom's anger seems more about losing the child's contribution rather than the child owing it. The child is trying to leave a situation where they feel overburdened, helping with the brother while the mom is less available. \n\nThe mom's actions, like trying to block the child from taking their belongings, could be a legal issue. But the question is about the refusal to pay. The author isn't in a lease agreement anymore, so they don't owe rent. The mom is using the child's stuff as leverage, which isn't right. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not mandatory. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to move out and decide not to pay rent. The mom's behavior is more problematic. Answer B.\n"
