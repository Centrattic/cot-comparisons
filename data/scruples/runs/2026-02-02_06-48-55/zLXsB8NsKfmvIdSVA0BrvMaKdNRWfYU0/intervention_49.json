I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves the author, almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. Their mom is upset because she's not getting the $300 anymore, which she claims she needs to pay for babysitting their brother. The author says they're sorry but they have their own bills. The mom is now trying to prevent them from taking their belongings, leading the author to consider calling the cops for a civil standby.\n\nFirst, legally, once someone moves out, they typically aren't responsible for their parents' bills unless there's a specific agreement. The author bought their own stuff, so they should be able to take it. The mom's demand for more money seems like a breach of that. The author is being independent, which is a good thing. The mom is using the brother's care as a justification for not letting the author go, which might be a bit manipulative. \n\nBut wait, the author is still considered a minor in some places if they're under 21. However, the text says they're almost 20, so maybe they're emancipated. If they're emancipated, they're legally an adult, and their mom can't force them to pay rent. The issue is the author's decision to stop paying the $300, which was part of the arrangement when they left their mom's house. The mom is now upset because she's losing that income. The author is in a position where they want independence, and the mom is trying to hold onto financial support. \n\nThe author is also offering to pay $50 for the dog, which they own. The mom is asking for more money, even though the author isn't part of the household anymore. The author's refusal to help with other bills is justified if they have their own responsibilities. The mom's behavior of trying to block the author from taking their belongings is problematic. Legally, the author has the right to their possessions, so the mom's actions could be considered illegal. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They're taking steps towards independence, and the mom is making it about her financial needs rather than the child's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
