I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason for moving out is that the mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has been seeing a friend with benefits multiple times a week, while the author gets limited time with their boyfriend. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses to pay more. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving to their own place, so they're not living under their mom's roof anymore. Ethically, the author is trying to set boundaries after feeling used as a babysitter. The mom is using emotional manipulation, claiming she can't afford the babysitting now that the author is moving out. However, the author is not responsible for the mom's financial decisions post-move-out. The $50 for the dog seems reasonable if the dog is the author's pet still. The mom's refusal to let the author take their things is a red flag; that's not right, and the author might need legal help there. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the mom's situation more? But the scenario describes the mom's behavior as being selfish, prioritizing her own needs over the author's well-being. The author is young and trying to establish independence, which is important for personal growth. Refusing to pay rent after moving out is their right, and the mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than genuine concern. The author's offer to help with the dog shows some consideration. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is moving out and not obligated to pay rent anymore, the mom is using the child's belongings as leverage, which is wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
