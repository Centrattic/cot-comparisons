I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out from their mom's house because their mom has been using them as a babysitter. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and wants more help with bills. The person is offering $50 for the dog's care but not more. The mom is blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent anymore. The person's mom was charging them rent, but that stops when they leave. The person isn't in the wrong for not continuing payments. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, but that's her issue, not the person's. \n\nThe person's reasons for moving out are valid\u2014personal freedom and not wanting to be a babysitter. Offering to help with the dog is a gesture, but they aren't responsible for other bills. The mom's actions of preventing them from taking their belongings are inappropriate. The person might need legal help to retrieve their stuff, but that's the mom's fault for trying to hold onto it.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're not obligated to pay rent after moving out, and the mom's actions are the problem here.\n"
