I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author, almost 20, wants to move out because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and is now trying to block the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is obligated to continue paying rent after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not responsible for rent anymore unless there's a lease agreement that binds them beyond their stay. The author is moving out, so they're not under any legal obligation here.\n\nThe mom is upset because she's losing the $300, but that's her financial situation, not the author's. The author is offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming, which seems reasonable if they want to help but aren't responsible for other bills. The mom's reaction\u2014calling the author a brat and blocking them from their belongings\u2014is problematic. The author's right to their belongings is important here; the mother can't legally prevent them from taking their stuff. If the author has to call the cops for a civil standby, that shows the mom is overstepping her bounds.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a life choice to move out, which is their right. The mother's actions are what's problematic here. The author isn't obligated to pay rent after moving out, and they're standing up for their own needs and belongings. The mother's resentment and attempts to block the move are on her side. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
