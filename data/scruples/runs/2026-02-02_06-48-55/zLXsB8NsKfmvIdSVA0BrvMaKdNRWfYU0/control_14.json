I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems low. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore and is treating the author like a babysitter since the parents split. The author is not continuing to pay the mom after moving out, but the mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parent unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving out, so they don't have a legal responsibility to keep paying rent to the mother. The mom's request for money beyond the $50 for the dog's care isn't enforceable unless there was a contract, which there isn't. \n\nEmotionally, the mom's reaction is tough. She's likely feeling the loss of financial support and maybe resentment. But the author has a right to move out and manage their own life and finances. The mom's actions of trying to block the author from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, as personal property should be allowed to be collected. The author might need to involve authorities if the mom is blocking access legally.\n\nThe author's offer to pay $50 for the dog is reasonable, showing they're trying to be fair. The mom's demand for more money is unreasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not continuing to pay rent after moving out. The mom's behavior is more concerning here. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
