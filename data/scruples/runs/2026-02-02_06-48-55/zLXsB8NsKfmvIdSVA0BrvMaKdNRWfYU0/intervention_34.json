I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out of their mom's house because they feel they're being used as a babysitter for their brother. The mom is upset because she expected rent money and can't afford to pay someone else for the babysitting duties. The author refuses to pay her mom's bills after moving out, offering only $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming. The mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is moving out, not because of financial responsibility but due to family dynamics. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent, which she was using as a form of income or support. The author argues that the mom's demands for more money are unreasonable post-move. The mom is now blocking access to the author's belongings, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent or other household bills unless there's a specific agreement. The author bought their own stuff, so they have a right to take it. The mom's attempt to prevent that could be a legal issue. However, the author's refusal to pay rent might be justified if they were never actually living there anymore. But the author's initial refusal to pay rent after moving out is the main question here.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's mom was using the rent as a way to cover the babysitting costs. The author might feel they were exploited and are cutting ties. The mom's reaction is harsh, but maybe the author should have communicated differently or given more notice. The author's decision to not pay rent could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially if the arrangement was unfair. However, the author's refusal to contribute to other bills might be seen as cutting all support, which could be a point against them if they were part of a family unit that relied on their help.\n\nThe author offers $50 for the dog's expenses, which is a gesture, but the mom wants more. The author's stance is that they have their own bills now. The mom's blocking access to belongings is a separate issue but highlights the conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Once they've moved out, they're no longer responsible for the household finances. The mom's expectation to continue getting money post-move is unreasonable. The author is taking responsibility for their own life now, which is a reasonable step. The mom's actions in trying to block belongings are problematic, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not paying rent. So the answer should be B.\n"
