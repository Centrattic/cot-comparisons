I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person including utilities, which they consider a good deal. Their main reason for moving out is because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mother is upset because she loses the $300 from the child's rent, and she can't afford someone else to watch the brother 3-4 nights a week. The author offered to pay $50 for the dog's food and grooming, which the mom demanded more for, but the author refuses. The mom is now blocking them from taking their belongings, leading to a possible police call.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay rent anymore unless there's a lease or agreement in place. The author never mentioned a lease, so they're probably not legally bound. The mom is upset about losing the $300, which suggests she might have counted on that income. However, the author's right to their own belongings is a legal matter. The mom can't prevent them from taking their personal property, so if she does, the author is justified in contacting the police for a civil standby. \n\nThe author's decision to stop paying rent after moving out is reasonable. They are moving into their own place and should be responsible for their own expenses. The mom's argument about babysitting is about the time spent, not financial help. The $50 offered for the dog is a gesture of goodwill, but the mom is overreaching by asking for more to cover other bills. The author isn't obligated to help with those, especially if they're moving out. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom's actions in blocking access to belongings are the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
