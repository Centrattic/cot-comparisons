I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they're moving out of their mom's house, and they're refusing to pay rent once they leave. The mom is upset because she was using the $300 to help with the bills, specifically to take care of the younger brother while she's with her FWB. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to pay rent anymore because they're moving out, and they're only offering $50 for the dog's care.\n\nFirst, legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to continue paying rent to your parents unless there's a contract. The author is moving out, so from a legal standpoint, they're not in the wrong for not paying rent after leaving. The mom's anger seems more about financial loss than actual legal entitlement. \n\nBut the moral angle here is tricky. The author mentions that their mom was using the money to cover babysitting costs. The author might feel they shouldn't have to support their family financially once they're independent. However, if the $300 was part of an agreement or expectation when they were living at home, the author might have a responsibility to honor that, especially if they were aware of it. But since the author is moving out and the situation has changed, the obligation might not exist anymore.\n\nThe mom's actions\u2014trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings\u2014could be a red flag. That's not right, regardless of the situation. The author might need to involve authorities to get their stuff back, which is understandable.\n\nThe author is offering $50 for the dog's care, which is a gesture, but the mom is demanding more. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries with their own finances once they're independent. The core issue is about the author's right to financial independence after moving out. The mom's anger stems from losing that income, but the author isn't obligated to continue supporting them once they're no longer living under the same roof. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally and ethically, the author isn't wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The mom's expectations might be unreasonable, especially if there was no formal agreement. The author is asserting their independence and managing their own expenses now. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
