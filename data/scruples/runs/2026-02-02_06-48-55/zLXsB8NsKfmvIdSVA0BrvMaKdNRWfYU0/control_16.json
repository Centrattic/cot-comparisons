I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities, which they consider a good deal. The main reason they want to move out is that their mom has been using them as a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else for babysitting.\n\nThe person offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses, but the mom wants more money for other bills. The person refuses, and the mom is trying to prevent them from taking their belongings, which they bought. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not paying their mom's bills after moving out.\n\nFirst, legal standpoint: Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's a prior agreement. The person is moving out, so they're not under their parents' roof anymore. The mom's financial situation is her problem, not the child's. The person is taking responsibility for their own bills and even offering to help with the dog, which is reasonable. The mom's attempt to block them from taking their things is a red flag. Legally, the person has the right to their belongings, so calling the cops for a civil standby is justified. The mom overstepped by trying to prevent them from taking their stuff. The person isn't in the wrong here; they're making a responsible choice to live independently and aren't responsible for their mom's new expenses. The mom's reaction is selfish and controlling. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
