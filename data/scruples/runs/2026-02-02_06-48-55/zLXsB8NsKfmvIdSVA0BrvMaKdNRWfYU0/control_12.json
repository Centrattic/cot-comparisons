I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is about to move out with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each for rent. Their mom is upset because she was using them as a live-in babysitter since the parents' divorce. The mom is now upset about losing the $300 and is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parents for room and board unless there's a specific agreement. The user is not staying in their mom's house anymore, so the $300 was part of their new living arrangement. The mom's claim about needing help with the brother isn't their responsibility anymore once they've moved out. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The user felt used as a babysitter, which is a valid reason to move out. The mom's reaction is about losing money, which might be more about her own stress than the child's well-being. The user is being reasonable by offering $50 for the dog, showing they're trying to help without being unfair.\n\nThe mom is now trying to prevent the user from taking their belongings. Legally, the user owns their stuff and can take it. The mom can't block that. The user might need to involve authorities if it escalates.\n\nSo overall, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and managing their own finances now. The mom's behavior is more about her own issues. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
