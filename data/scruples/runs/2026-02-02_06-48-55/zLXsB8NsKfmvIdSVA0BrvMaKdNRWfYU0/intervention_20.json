I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is about to move out with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person for rent and utilities. The mother is upset because she won't get the $300 and is treating the author as a babysitter for the brother. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but the mom wants more. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay the parent's bills unless there's a written agreement. The author is not under any legal obligation here. Ethically, the author is trying to leave to have their own life, which seems reasonable. The mother is using the child as a babysitter and now is upset when they leave, which is a bit selfish. The author is not at fault for wanting to move out and not continuing to pay rent to their mother. The offer of $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the mother's demands for more money are unreasonable. The mother's actions in blocking the author from taking their things are problematic and possibly illegal, as belongings belong to the person, even if they live at home. The author might need to involve authorities to reclaim their property, which is their right.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to move out and not pay rent anymore. The mother's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
