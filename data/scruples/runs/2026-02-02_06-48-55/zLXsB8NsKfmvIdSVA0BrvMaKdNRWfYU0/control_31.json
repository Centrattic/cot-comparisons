I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves a 20-year-old moving out because their mom is using them as a babysitter for the younger brother. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and is now trying to block the person from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement. Since the person is moving out, they\u2019re no longer residing there, so the responsibility to pay rent ends. The mom is trying to claim she can't afford to cover the brother's care costs, but that's her issue to resolve, not the kid's. \n\nMoral considerations: The person has the right to their belongings. The mom's reaction of being livid and trying to prevent them from taking their things is problematic. The person is offering $50 for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable if they still have a pet. The mom's demand for more money beyond that seems like an overreach. \n\nAlso, the parent's role in providing for the child until they're independent is part of the dynamic here. Once the child moves out, it's expected that the parent stops supporting them financially. The mom is acting as if the child still has an obligation, which might be the parent's problem, not the child's. \n\nThe police involvement to reclaim belongings is a red flag. The person shouldn't face obstacles to taking their own possessions. The mom's actions in blocking access to personal items are wrong, and the person has the right to do a civil standby if necessary.\n\nPutting it all together: The person isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom is the one acting inconsiderately by expecting continued financial support and interfering with the child's property. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
