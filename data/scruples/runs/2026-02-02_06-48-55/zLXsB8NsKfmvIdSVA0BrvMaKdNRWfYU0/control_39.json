I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person, almost 20, wants to move out because their mom is treating them like a babysitter for their brother while she's with her boyfriend. The mom is upset because she loses the rent money, and now the person is refusing to pay any more money for bills after moving out. The mom is even trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal responsibility and boundaries. The person is moving out to live independently, which is a common step into adulthood. The mother's reliance on the child for childcare and financial support might be an issue. The person is cutting off the $300 rent because they're no longer living there, and the mother is demanding more money for bills, which the person refuses. The person is also offering to pay for the dog's expenses since they still own the dog. \n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay for the parent's bills unless there was a prior agreement. The mother's anger might stem from financial dependency rather than the child's right to leave. The person is standing up for their own independence and financial autonomy, which is a valid choice. The mother's actions (blocking belongings) are problematic and could be considered harassment or interference with personal property. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's about whether the person is being selfish or self-reliant. The person's decision to leave is about their own well-being and freedom. The mother's behavior is manipulative and controlling. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not providing financial support beyond what's agreed (like the dog's care). The mother's threats and attempts to block the move are more concerning than the author's refusal to pay. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
