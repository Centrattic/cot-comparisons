I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The main conflict is that the mom is upset because she won't get the rent money anymore, which she was using to cover childcare for her younger brother. The author refuses to pay her mom's bills after moving out, only offering $50 a month for the dog's care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. Once someone moves out, they are generally not obligated to pay their parents' bills unless there's a specific agreement in place. The author isn't living in the house anymore, so the rent arrangement should cease. The mom might have been using the rent to help with the brother's care, but that's a separate issue.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're moving out to have their own space and the mom's behavior has been problematic. The mom's actions, like trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, seem like overstepping. The author is standing up for themselves, which is understandable. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the author isn't responsible for other bills as they're moving out.\n\nEmotionally, the mom's reaction is harsh, but the author is within their rights to stop paying after moving out. The key point is that the author isn't in the wrong because there's no legal obligation to pay rent once they've moved out. The mom's financial situation shouldn't affect the author's decision to leave. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
