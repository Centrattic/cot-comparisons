I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom was upset because she expected rent from them, which she's using to cover babysitting for their brother. The person says they want to leave because their mom treats them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. They offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refused to pay more for other bills.\n\nNow, legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay the previous household's bills. The mom's argument that she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother might be her problem, not the person's. The person isn't responsible for their sibling's care unless they were legally obligated, which they weren't in this case. Also, the mom's reaction of trying to block them from taking their own belongings is aggressive and possibly illegal. \n\nThe person didn't break any laws by refusing to pay rent after moving out. They were providing support for the dog, which is reasonable. The mom's resentment and actions seem to stem from financial stress, but that doesn't make the person at fault. The key point is that leaving the family home is a right, especially when there's a valid reason like the parent's behavior. So, the person isn't in the wrong here.\n"
