I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 19 years old and wants to move out. They've been helping their mom by acting as a babysitter for their brother because their parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent from her when she moves out. The person is refusing to pay rent after moving out and is only offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the person is an adult (almost 20) and moving out is a normal step towards independence. It's reasonable for them to want to live separately, especially since their mom is relying on them for childcare instead of her own social life. The rent arrangement the person is moving into is cheaper, so they might not have the extra money to continue paying their mom. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The person isn't legally obligated to support their parents unless there's a specific agreement. Also, offering to pay for the dog's care is fair since the dog is theirs. The mom's attempt to block the person from taking their belongings is problematic. So, the person isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
