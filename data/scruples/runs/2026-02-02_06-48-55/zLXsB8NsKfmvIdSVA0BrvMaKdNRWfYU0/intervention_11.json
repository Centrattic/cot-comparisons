I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. They want to move out because their mom has been using them as a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has a FWB (friends with benefits) who she sees multiple times a week, while the user only gets to see their boyfriend once or twice a week. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The user is offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses but not more. The mom is trying to prevent them from taking their stuff, and they might need to call the cops.\n\nFirst, the user is moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent to your parents unless there's some kind of agreement in place. So the user isn't in the wrong for not continuing to pay rent after leaving. The mom is upset because she's losing the money, but that's her problem, not the user's. However, the user is offering $50 for the dog, which shows some consideration, but the mom is asking for more. The user is within their rights to say no.\n\nThe mom's behavior is questionable. Trying to prevent the user from taking their belongings is illegal in most places. The user might have a legal right to their property, and calling the police is a reasonable step. The mom's anger about the $300 seems more about her financial situation than the user's responsibility. The user's main issue was the lack of personal time due to babysitting, which is a valid reason to move out.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an unspoken expectation in some families to contribute financially even after moving out, but there's no legal obligation here. The user isn't avoiding responsibility entirely, just not continuing to pay rent. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not required. The mom's reaction might be overblown. The user is taking their stuff, which they own, and isn't being unreasonable there. The mom's attempts to block them from taking their belongings could be a bigger issue, but that's her fault, not the user's.\n\nSo considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They have a valid reason for moving and are not obligated to continue paying. The mom's behavior is more to blame here. The answer would be B (the user is not in the wrong).\n"
