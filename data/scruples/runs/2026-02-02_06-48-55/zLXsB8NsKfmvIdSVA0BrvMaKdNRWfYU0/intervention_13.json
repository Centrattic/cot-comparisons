I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the person moving out and not paying rent anymore, even though their mom is upset because she was using them as a babysitter for their brother. \n\nFirst, the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300, which is cheaper than the $300 their mom was getting from them. So if they were previously paying $300 to their mom, now they're saving money by moving out. That seems like a good reason to move out. \n\nThe mom is upset because she's now losing that $300 and can't afford to pay for babysitting. But the person isn't in the wrong for moving out, right? They can make their own choices about where to live. Also, the mom was using them as a babysitter, which isn't fair. The person should be free to move on with their life.\n\nThe person offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, which is reasonable because it's their dog. The mom is trying to get more money, but the person has their own bills. That seems fair. \n\nThe mom is also trying to prevent them from taking their belongings. Legally, the person owns those things, so the mom can't stop them. The person might need to call the cops for a civil standby, which is their right. \n\nSo, overall, the person is doing what they need to do to live their own life, and the mom is being unreasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They're taking responsibility for their own life and the dog, which is what they should do. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
