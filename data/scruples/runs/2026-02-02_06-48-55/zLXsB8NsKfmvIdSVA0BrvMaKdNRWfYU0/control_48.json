I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The mom is upset because she was getting rent from the author before, but now the author isn't paying anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent unless there's a specific agreement. The mom might have been using the author's rent to help with the household, but that's different from a legal obligation. The author isn't under a lease anymore, so they don't have to pay rent. The $50 for the dog's expenses is a separate matter\u2014maybe a voluntary contribution, not rent.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mom is upset and is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings. That's a red flag. If the mom is using the situation to control the author, that's a problem. The author is trying to become independent, which is a normal part of growing up. The mom's reaction might stem from her own issues, like financial stress or feeling responsible for childcare after the divorce. But that doesn't make the author at fault for wanting to move out and not pay rent anymore.\n\nAlso, the author is offering to cover some costs related to the dog, which shows some consideration. The mom's demand for more money is unreasonable if there's no agreement. The author isn't responsible for the mom's other bills. The mom's actions of trying to block the author from taking their stuff are problematic and possibly illegal. The author might need to involve the police to reclaim their property, which is their right.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They're asserting their independence, and the mom's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
