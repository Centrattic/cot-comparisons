I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom was upset about losing the $300 rent and now the kid is refusing to pay her any money even for the dog's expenses.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong. Let me see if that holds. When you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay your parents for their expenses unless there's a prior agreement. The mom was using the child as a babysitter after the parents' divorce, which seems like an unfair dynamic. The child wanting independence is valid. However, the mom is now upset about losing the money and is trying to block the child from taking their belongings. \n\nThe author offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, which is reasonable if the dog is still their responsibility. The mom's demand for more money beyond that might be unreasonable. The key here is that once someone moves out, they aren't responsible for the parents' bills unless they agreed otherwise. The mom's actions of trying to prevent the child from taking their stuff are problematic. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom is the one acting inconsiderate and trying to hold onto money. The author's decision is about gaining independence, which is a common and acceptable step. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
