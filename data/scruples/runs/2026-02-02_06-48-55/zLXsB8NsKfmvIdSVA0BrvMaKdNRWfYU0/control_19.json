I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. They were paying rent and utilities to their mom, but now they're moving out, so they don't want to continue paying her. The mom is upset because she was using the $300 for bills and taking care of the brother. The person is offering $50 a month for the dog's needs. \n\nI think the key points here are about responsibility and obligations. Once someone moves out, especially as an adult, they're generally not required to contribute to their parent's household expenses unless they've made a prior agreement. The mom seems to have been using the money as a form of childcare, which isn't a typical parent-child dynamic, especially when the parent is an adult. The person wants independence, which is reasonable. The mom's actions in trying to block them from taking their belongings might be more of an issue. \n\nThe person is not in the wrong for stopping the payments once they move out. They're taking responsibility for their own living expenses now. The mom's demands for more money after the move seems like an overreach. Also, the person is still helping with the dog, which is a gesture of continued care. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and not financially responsible for their parent's lifestyle choices.\n"
