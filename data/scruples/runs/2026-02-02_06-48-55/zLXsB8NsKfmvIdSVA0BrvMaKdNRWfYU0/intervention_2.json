I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she won't get the $300 and is treating the author as a babysitter for their brother.\n\nFirst, the author is moving out, which is a common step towards independence. Paying rent in the new place is necessary for their own living situation. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss and needing childcare. However, once the author moves out, they are no longer living under their parent's roof, so the expectation to continue paying rent to the parent might not be valid. \n\nThe author mentions that the mom is using them as a babysitter since the parents split. This could imply that the mom has been relying on the author for childcare, which might not be fair. The author's decision to move out to have their own life is understandable. \n\nRegarding the $50 a month for the dog's expenses, that's a separate agreement and reasonable. The mom's demand for more money to help with other bills after the author moves out might be unreasonable, as the author is now financially responsible for their own living. \n\nThe mom's actions of trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings are problematic. Legally, the author has the right to their belongings, and calling the police for a civil standby is a valid step if needed. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, once someone moves out, they are typically not expected to support their parents financially unless there's a prior agreement (like a contract for living expenses). The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own autonomy and financial responsibilities in their new home. The mom's reaction seems more about financial dependency and lack of support rather than the author's actions being unjust. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a responsible decision to live independently and are not obligated to support their parents financially after moving out. The mom's behavior, especially trying to withhold belongings, is more concerning here.\n"
