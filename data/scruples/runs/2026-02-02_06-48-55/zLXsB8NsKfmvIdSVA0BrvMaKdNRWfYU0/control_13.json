I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The main points here are about the daughter moving out, the mother's reaction, and the financial aspects.\n\nFirst, the daughter is moving out to live with her boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which is considered affordable. The reason she's moving is because her mom has been treating her like a babysitter since the parents' divorce, and she only sees her boyfriend once or twice a week. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and can't afford to pay someone else to watch her brother. The daughter offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses more. The mom is trying to block her from taking her belongings unless she pays more, leading to a possible police call.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The daughter bought her own stuff, so the mom can't legally prevent her from taking them. Ethically, it's about responsibility. The mom was using the daughter as a babysitter, which might be a separate issue. The daughter might feel she's not responsible for her brother's care after moving out. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the mom's demand for more isn't justified if there's no prior agreement. The mom's actions of trying to block her stuff are problematic. The daughter isn't in the wrong for not continuing to pay rent post-move. The mother's anger seems more about the loss of income rather than the daughter's well-being. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
