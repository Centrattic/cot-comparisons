I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent there is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she was getting money from the author before, and now she's not, and she's even trying to block the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay your parents for rent unless there was a formal agreement. The author isn't staying in their mom's house anymore, so it's reasonable they don't have to pay her. The mom might have expected continued financial support, but that's not a legal requirement. The author is giving $50 a month for the dog, which is a personal choice, not a legal obligation either.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author felt used as a babysitter and wanted independence. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than missing the child. The mom's attempt to prevent the author from taking their belongings is problematic and could be illegal, as personal property should be allowed to be collected. The author might need legal help, like the police for a civil standby.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the info, the author isn't obligated to pay rent post-move. The mom's actions are more questionable. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their independence and not violating any legal obligations by not paying rent after moving out.\n"
