I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent to their mom after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, where the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she was getting that money and now she has to cover the cost of babysitting their brother. The author is offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses but not more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parents for room and board unless there's a formal agreement. The author isn't required to pay rent to their mom after moving out. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The author mentions that their mom has been using them as a babysitter since the parents split. The mom now expects the author to contribute financially, but the author is moving out for their own reasons. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than genuine concern for her son's care. The author is offering some financial help for the dog, which they still own. The mom is being unreasonable by refusing to let the author take their belongings.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't legally obligated to pay rent after moving out, the mom's demands go beyond reasonable expectations, and the author is trying to set boundaries. The mom's actions (blocking the author from taking their stuff) are problematic. The author's refusal to pay more than the dog's expenses is justified because they are moving out and have their own responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're making a reasonable decision to move out and aren't obligated to continue paying their mom beyond what they've offered for the dog.\n"
