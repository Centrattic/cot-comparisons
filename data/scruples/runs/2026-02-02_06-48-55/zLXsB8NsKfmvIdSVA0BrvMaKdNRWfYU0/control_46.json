I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They're 19, moving in with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 each. The main reason they want to move out is because their mom treats them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 and can't afford to pay someone else for the brother's care. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses, but the mom wants more and is blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, when someone moves out, they generally aren't responsible for the family's bills anymore. The mom might have been using the rent money to help with the brother's care, but that's her responsibility now. The person isn't obligated to continue paying unless there was a prior agreement. The mom's reaction of being angry and trying to prevent them from taking their belongings is problematic. Legally, you can't stop someone from taking their belongings unless there's a court order. The person might need to involve authorities if the mom is being obstructionist. The offer to help with the dog is generous, but the mom's demands beyond that aren't justified. So, the person isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The mom's actions are more concerning here.\n"
