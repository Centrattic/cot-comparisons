I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. The problem is their mom is upset because she's used to getting $300 a month, which she's now using to pay for babysitting her brother.\n\nFirst, the author isn't legally obligated to pay rent once they've moved out. Legally, once you leave, the landlord (in this case, the mom) can't make you pay unless there's a contract, which there probably isn't here. So the basic premise is that they're not required to pay. \n\nBut there's emotional stuff here. The mom is acting out of self-interest, not the child's well-being. She's using the brother as leverage, but the author is an adult and the reason for moving out is to escape the mom's neglect of the brother. The mom is treating the author as a babysitter, which isn't appropriate once the child is an adult. \n\nThe author is offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable. The mom is demanding more, which the author can't afford. The mom is also blocking the author from taking their belongings. Legally, the author owns their stuff, so the mom can't prevent that. \n\nSo, the author is standing up for their own needs, setting boundaries, and not continuing to support the mom's lifestyle. The mom is the one acting inconsiderately. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
