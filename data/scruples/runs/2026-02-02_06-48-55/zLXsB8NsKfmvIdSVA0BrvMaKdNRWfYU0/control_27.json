I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is almost 20, moving out because their mom has been using them as a babysitter. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. The author is refusing to pay her mom's bills after moving out and is giving $50 for the dog. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their stuff.\n\nSo, the main question is about financial responsibility after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay the previous household's bills unless there's a legal agreement. The author is not in the wrong for not paying rent after they're no longer a tenant. The mom's anger seems to be about losing the money, which might be her own financial mismanagement. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable, especially if they were used as a babysitter. The mom's actions in blocking belongings could be a red flag, but that's more about property rights. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own life and responsibilities. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
