I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and wants to move out. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each including utilities. The main reason for moving is that their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their brother since the parents split. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and can't afford to pay someone else for the brother's care. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but not more. The mom is blocking them from taking their belongings, leading to a possible police call.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the person obligated to pay rent after moving out? Typically, once you move out, you're not responsible for the former home's rent. The mom might have expected continued financial support, but that's not standard unless there's an agreement. The person is paying for the dog, which they own, so contributing to the dog's costs makes sense.\n\nThe mom's anger seems more about losing financial support rather than actual inability to care for the brother. The person isn't legally obligated to pay her bills after moving out. Offering some help with the dog is reasonable, but the mom's demand for more money is where the issue lies. The person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries on their own finances after becoming independent.\n\nAlso, the mom's actions in preventing the person from taking their things are problematic. Legally, belongings belong to the person, so the mom can't stop them. The threat to call the cops is justified if the mom is blocking access to personal property.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking responsibility for their own life and setting healthy boundaries. The mom's expectations are unreasonable, and the author is right to refuse paying more than they've already offered.\n"
