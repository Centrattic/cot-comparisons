I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which they find a good deal. The main issue is that the mom was upset about losing the $300 a month, which she was using to pay for babysitting her younger brother. The person feels they were being used as a babysitter since the parents split. They agreed to pay $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming. The mom is now blocking them from taking their stuff and demanding more money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the person is obligated to pay rent after moving out. Generally, once someone moves out of their parents' house, there's no legal obligation to pay rent unless there's a specific agreement. The person is paying their own bills once they move out, which is reasonable. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300, which she was using for babysitting costs, but that's her responsibility now. The person isn't required to cover that unless there was a prior agreement, which there doesn't seem to be.\n\nThen there's the part about the dog. The person is paying $50 for the dog's expenses, which is fair since they still own the dog. The mom is trying to get more money, but the person isn't obligated to do that. The mom's reaction of calling the cops to block the person from taking their belongings is problematic. Legally, the person has the right to their belongings. The mom is acting in a way that's trying to hold onto their property, which is not right.\n\nThe person's reasoning for moving out is valid\u2014they want independence and aren't being treated fairly by their mom. The mom's reliance on the child for babysitting isn't a valid reason to expect continued financial support once the child moves out. The person is not at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The mom's actions in trying to prevent them from taking their things are wrong. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
