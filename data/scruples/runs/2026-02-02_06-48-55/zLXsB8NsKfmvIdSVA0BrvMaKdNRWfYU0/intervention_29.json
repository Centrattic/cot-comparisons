I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves family dynamics, financial responsibilities, and emotional conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300/month. The mom is upset because she expected this money to help with childcare after the parents' divorce. The author feels they've been treated as a live-in babysitter and wants independence. The mom is now trying to block the author from taking their belongings, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they're generally not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a formal agreement. The author bought their own stuff, so legally they should be able to retrieve those items. The mom's financial situation and childcare needs don't legally bind the adult child to pay. The author's offer of $50/month for the dog's care is a gesture, but not required.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged by their mom's expectations. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than the child's independence. The author's refusal to pay is about asserting autonomy and setting boundaries after years of perceived unfair treatment. The mom's actions (blocking belongings) are problematic and could be considered emotionally manipulative.\n\nEthically, adult children aren't obligated to support their parents financially unless they've made a prior agreement. The author's situation shows a desire for independence, which is reasonable. The mom's financial difficulties don't override the child's right to leave. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay; the mom's actions are more concerning here. So the answer is B.\n"
