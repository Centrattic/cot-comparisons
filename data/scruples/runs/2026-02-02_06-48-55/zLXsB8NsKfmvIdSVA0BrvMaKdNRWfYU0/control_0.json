I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out, a family conflict, and financial responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author is almost 20 and moving out of their mom's house. They were paying rent, but after moving out, they refuse to continue paying her. The mom is upset because she relies on the author to help with their brother and bills since the parents split. The author mentions that they want to move out to have their own life with their boyfriend and friends. They offer $50 a month for the dog's expenses but not more. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings, leading to a potential legal issue.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is an adult moving out, which is their right. They were paying rent before, but once they leave, they aren't obligated to continue. The mom is using the child to make the author stay, which seems manipulative. The author's refusal to pay extra beyond the dog is reasonable. The mom's actions in preventing the author from taking their stuff are problematic and possibly illegal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, once someone moves out, they're not responsible for the previous living arrangement's finances unless there's a legal agreement. The author is within their rights to stop paying. The mom's reaction is more about her financial situation and emotional reliance on the author, which isn't the author's responsibility. The author is trying to establish independence, which is a normal part of adult life. The mom's attempt to block belongings is a red flag; that's not acceptable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to prioritize their own life and set boundaries. The mom's behavior is manipulative and controlling. The answer should be B (No).\n"
