I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the person moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. They mention that their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and is now trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parent rent unless there's a formal agreement. The author is not staying in the house anymore, so the rent arrangement would naturally end. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother is her own financial issue, not the author's responsibility. The author is within their rights to not continue paying rent once they've moved out.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author feels they were being used as a babysitter, which is a valid reason to want to move out. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child leaving home. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable. However, the author offered $50 a month for the dog, which shows some consideration, but the mom is asking for more, which the author correctly refuses.\n\nThe conflict over belongings is another point. The author bought their own items, so they have the right to take them. The mom trying to block that is problematic. Legally, the author can call the police for a civil standby to retrieve their property without confrontation.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. I need to weigh the legal rights versus the emotional dynamics. Legally, the author is not in the wrong. The mom's actions are more concerning. The author is asserting their independence and financial responsibility, which is reasonable. The mom's anger and withholding the author's belongings are her issues, not the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
