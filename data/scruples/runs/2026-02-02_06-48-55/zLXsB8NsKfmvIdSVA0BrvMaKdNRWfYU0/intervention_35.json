I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the person moving out and refusing to pay rent, but they're still giving $50 a month for their dog's care. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author is moving out because their mom is treating them like a babysitter for their brother while she dates someone else. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore, which she uses to pay for the babysitting. The author refuses to pay her mom's bills after moving out, except for the dog's expenses. The mom is blocking the author from taking their belongings, leading to the possibility of calling the cops.\n\nNow, the key points here are about financial responsibility and living arrangements. When someone moves out, they are typically not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is paying rent to their new place, which is standard. The mom is using the money as a form of childcare, which might be a separate issue. The author is offering to help with the dog, which they own, so that's reasonable.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. Once they leave, they're no longer responsible for their parents' household expenses. The mom's anger stems from losing financial support, but that's her responsibility to manage. The author is handling their own bills and is even contributing to the dog's care. The mom's actions in blocking belongings are problematic, as the author owns their stuff.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom is handling the situation poorly by trying to prevent the move and withholding belongings. The answer should be B.\n"
