I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out at almost 20, into a place with a boyfriend and friends where rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300, which she was using to cover babysitting for the brother. The author offers $50 for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more and is blocking the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they usually aren't obligated to pay their parents unless there's a formal agreement. The author is an adult, so there's no legal requirement here. Ethically, it's about responsibility and fairness. The mom seems to be using the author's rent to cover her own childcare needs, which isn't the author's responsibility. The author is trying to become independent, which is understandable. Offering $50 for the dog's care is a gesture, but the mom wants more, which the author isn't in a position to provide.\n\nThe mom's actions of preventing the author from taking their belongings are problematic. Threatening to call the police suggests a possible legal issue because the author owns their stuff. The author might be in the right there. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The author isn't obligated to pay rent after moving out. The mom's anger stems from losing financial support she was receiving, which is her problem, not the author's. The author is setting boundaries, which is healthy. The $50 offer is a nice touch but not required. The mom's response of being \"livid\" and trying to block the author from taking their belongings is the real issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent post-move-out. The mom's behavior is more questionable. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
