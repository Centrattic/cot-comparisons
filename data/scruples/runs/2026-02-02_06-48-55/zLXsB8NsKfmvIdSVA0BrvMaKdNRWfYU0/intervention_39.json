I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is almost 20 and wants to move out. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each for rent and utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author refuses to pay her mom, offers $50 a month for the dog, and the mom is now blocking them from taking their stuff. The author might have to call the cops to retrieve their belongings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying rent to their mom after moving out. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author is an adult, almost 20, and moving out is a normal step. The mom was using the rent as a way to cover childcare costs, but the author isn't obligated to pay rent to their parent once they move out. The $50 for the dog seems reasonable, especially since the author can't take the pet. The mom's actions of blocking the author from their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, as a parent can't prevent an adult child from taking their property. \n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, once someone moves out, they aren't required to support their parents unless there's a legal obligation, which there isn't here. The author's decision to not pay rent is their own choice, and the mom's anger stems from financial loss, not the child's well-being. The fact that the mom is using the dog as a leverage point might be emotional, but the author is covering the dog's expenses as a gesture, not a legal requirement.\n\nThe mom's reaction is extreme\u2014blocking belongings and calling the child a brat. This suggests a possible emotional manipulation or financial dependency. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since they are now independent. The mom's inability to manage childcare is her issue, not the author's. \n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are taking responsibility for their independence, and the mom's behavior is more about her own financial situation than the child's actions. The answer should be B (No)."
