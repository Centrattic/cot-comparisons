I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out to live with a boyfriend and friends, which is a significant step towards independence.\n\nFirst, the author mentions moving out and that the rent is $300 per person. The parent is upset because they lose the $300 and can't afford childcare now. The parent is treating the author as a live-in babysitter since the parents split. The author is not responsible for the parent's current childcare costs once they've moved out. \n\nThe author offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable since they're still responsible for the pet. The parent is demanding more money, which the author can't provide. The parent is also preventing the author from taking their belongings, which is a legal issue. \n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parents' bills. The parent's role in providing childcare is their own responsibility now. The author is within their rights to not pay the $300 as rent because they are no longer living there. However, the parent's actions in blocking the author from taking their belongings are problematic and likely illegal. \n\nThe author is trying to assert their independence and set boundaries, which is a common situation when young adults move out. The parent's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay the rent post-move out. The parent's behavior in blocking belongings is the real issue here. So, the answer should be B.\n"
