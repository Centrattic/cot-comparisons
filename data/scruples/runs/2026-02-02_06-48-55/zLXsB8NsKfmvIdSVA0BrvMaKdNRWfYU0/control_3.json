I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter for their brother since the parents split. The mom has a friend with benefits (FWB) she sees often, while the person only gets to see their boyfriend once or twice a week. The mom is upset about not getting $300 a month in rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The person offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming but refused more help. The mom is now trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the person is moving out, they were paying rent (or contributing) while living at home, and now they're refusing to continue that after moving out. The mom is upset because she can't afford to cover the brother's care without their help. The person is arguing that they're not responsible for that anymore.\n\nLegally, when someone moves out, they're not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The person is moving into a place where they are paying rent, so they're setting up their own household. The mom's argument is that she can't afford to pay for the brother's care now that the person is leaving. However, the person is not in a parent-child financial agreement anymore once they move out. The $300 was part of living at home, not a separate obligation. The mom's anger seems to stem from losing that financial support, not necessarily about the person moving out.\n\nThe person offered $50 for the dog, which is reasonable if the dog is still theirs. The mom's demand for more money is where things get tricky. But the person isn't obligated to help with other bills once they move out. The mom's actions in trying to prevent them from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal if she's denying access to personal property. The person might need to involve authorities to retrieve their items.\n\nConsidering all this, the person isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They were contributing while living at home, which is different from after they've moved out. The mom's responsibilities towards the brother are her own now, and the person isn't obligated to continue financial support. The mom's behavior in blocking belongings crosses a line, but the initial refusal to pay rent is justified.\n"
