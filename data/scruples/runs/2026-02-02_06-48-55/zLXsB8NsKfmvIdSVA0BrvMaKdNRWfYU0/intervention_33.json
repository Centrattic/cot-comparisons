I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the author is almost 20 and moving out with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which they consider a good deal. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she's losing the $300 from the author's supposed \"rent\" to help cover bills, especially since she's acting as a babysitter for the brother. The author is not actually paying rent anymore, so they're not obligated to continue. \n\nThe mom is using the money as a childcare subsidy, which isn't fair because the author is an adult moving out. The author is offering $50 for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable. The mom is being unreasonable by trying to stop the author from taking their belongings. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They're an adult making a choice to live independently. The mom's expectation of continued financial support isn't justified. The answer should be B.\n"
