I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out of their mom's house, which they were already planning to do. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and is trying to use the brother's childcare as a reason to keep the daughter there. The daughter is cutting down to $50 a month for the dog's expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The daughter is moving out, so she's no longer a tenant in her mom's house. The mom's anger seems to be about losing the financial support, which could be a red flag. The daughter has her own responsibilities and wants to establish independence. \n\nThe mom's argument about childcare is manipulative. The daughter wasn't under any obligation to babysit; she chose to do it, but now she's leaving. The mom's reaction of holding her things hostage and threatening legal action over unpaid rent (which would be non-existent after moving out) is inappropriate. The daughter taking $50 for the dog is reasonable since she's still responsible for it.\n\nSo, the daughter isn't in the wrong. She's choosing to prioritize her own life and can't be held responsible for her mom's financial decisions. The mom is the one acting unreasonably. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
