I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the mom is upset because she loses the rent money. The person is refusing to pay rent after moving out and even cutting down the support for their dog from $300 to $50. The mom is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement. Since the person is moving out, there's no lease, so they aren't in the wrong legally. Ethically, maybe the question is about responsibility towards family. The mom was using the person as a babysitter, which is a problem. But the person is an adult, almost 20, so they have the right to live independently. The mom's behavior of using the child as a babysitter is questionable. The person is cutting off financial support beyond what they owe for the dog, which is their responsibility. The mom is trying to prevent them from taking their belongings, which is illegal if they own the items. \n\nThe person is in a situation where they're trying to leave a toxic dynamic. Refusing to pay rent after moving out is understandable because they're no longer living there. The mom's anger stems from financial loss, but that's not the adult child's responsibility. The person is only helping with the dog's expenses, which is reasonable if they're still responsible for the pet. The mom's actions in trying to block them from taking their things are wrong. \n\nSo ethically, the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to move out and not support their parent financially after leaving. The mom's behavior is more problematic here. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
