I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, and they were paying rent to their mom, but now they're not. The mom is upset because she's used to the $300 and now has to cover her brother's childcare costs. The author isn't paying anymore and is giving $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to stop paying rent after moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay rent to your parents unless there's a specific agreement. The mom might have been using the rent money for other purposes, like childcare, but that's her responsibility now. The author is within their rights to stop paying since they're no longer living there. The $50 for the dog is a personal choice and not a legal obligation either. The mom's actions of trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff might be illegal, as personal belongings belong to the individual. \n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The author might feel they were exploited, using their money to cover their mom's childcare while the mom was out. Moving out is a step towards independence, which is understandable. The mom's anger and blocking access to belongings is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and independence. The mom's demands for more money after the move also seem unfair. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom's behavior is more concerning here. So the answer should be B.\n"
