I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main issue is that the author's mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from them anymore, as she uses the author to babysit their brother while she's with her boyfriend. The author isn't taking the dog, so they offer $50 for dog food and grooming.\n\nFirst, the author has the right to move out once they're an adult. It's their choice to leave the family home. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than the author's well-being. The author isn't obligated to pay rent after moving out unless there's a prior agreement, which there doesn't seem to be. The mom's behavior of trying to block the author from taking their belongings is problematic and possibly illegal if she's holding their stuff without reason. The author is standing up for themselves, maintaining that they have their own bills to pay, which is reasonable. The $50 offer is a gesture of goodwill, even though it's not required. The mom's threats and actions suggest she's acting out of self-interest, not the author's best interest. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're taking responsibility for their life and setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
