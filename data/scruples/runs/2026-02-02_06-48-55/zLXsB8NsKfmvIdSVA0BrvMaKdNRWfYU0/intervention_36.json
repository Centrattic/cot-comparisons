I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out because their mom is treating them like a live-in babysitter. The mom is upset because she won't get $300/month in rent and can't afford to pay for the brother's care anymore. The person offered $50/month for the dog's expenses but refused to pay more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone moves out, they're not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement or legal obligation. The person isn't a tenant in this case; the house is their mom's, so the concept of rent might not apply the same way. However, if there was an informal arrangement where the person contributed money towards household expenses, that's different. But once they move out, that arrangement should end unless agreed otherwise.\n\nThe mom is upset because she relied on that $300 to cover the brother's care. The person is moving out for their own reasons, which seems valid. However, the mom's financial situation is now in trouble because of this. The person isn't at fault for needing to move out, but the refusal to contribute after moving out could be seen as a different matter. The person is now living independently and should be responsible for their own expenses. The mom's claim that the person is being ungrateful might be emotional, but the person's actions are about their own autonomy.\n\nThe person offered $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable if the dog was part of the household. But refusing to pay other bills is justified since they're no longer residing there. The mom trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings is problematic and could be illegal; the person might have a right to their possessions regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, combining these points, the person isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. They're taking responsibility for their own life, and the mom's issues stem from her own financial planning. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
