I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is moving out at almost 20 years old, moving in with their boyfriend and friends where rent is $300 per person. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from the author anymore, as she was using the author to help with watching her younger brother since the parents split. The author is not paying rent anymore after moving out and is offering $50 a month for the dog's care. The mom is now trying to block the author from taking their belongings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a written agreement. The mom was using the author as a babysitter, which isn't a valid reason to keep extracting money. The author is now living independently and has their own expenses. The mom's demand for more money beyond the dog's care isn't justified. The mom's actions of preventing the author from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal. The author's decision to stop paying rent is reasonable since they're no longer living there. The $50 for the dog is a gesture but not a legal obligation. The mom's reaction seems extreme and controlling. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay more. They're exercising their right to live independently and are not obligated to support their mother financially beyond what they've already offered.\n"
