I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refused more. The mom is now blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author bought their own stuff, so they have the right to take it. The mom's claim about losing $300 is about her own financial situation, which isn't the author's responsibility once they've moved out. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to leave a situation where they felt overburdened, acting as a babysitter. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than the child's well-being. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the author isn't responsible for the mom's other bills. The mom's attempt to prevent the author from taking their belongings is problematic and possibly illegal, as personal belongings belong to the individual.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They have the right to leave and manage their own finances. The mom's actions are more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
