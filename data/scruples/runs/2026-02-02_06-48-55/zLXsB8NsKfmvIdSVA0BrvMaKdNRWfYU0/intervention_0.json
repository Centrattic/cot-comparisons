I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The main issue is that the mother is upset because she won't be receiving the $300 anymore and is now treating the author like a babysitter for their younger brother.\n\nThe author mentions that they were paying rent as a \"steal\" in their area, so it's not an exorbitant amount. They decided to move out because of the mother's behavior after the parents' divorce. The mother is now trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, which might require a civil standby. The author is also offering $50 a month for the dog's care since they can't take the dog with them.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a written agreement. Since the author was contributing to the household expenses while living there, maybe as part of a family arrangement, but once they move out, that financial obligation typically ends. The mother's argument that she can't afford to pay for babysitting now seems like a personal issue rather than something the author is responsible for. The mother's actions of trying to block the author from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, which the author might need to address with authorities.\n\nEthically, the author has the right to leave and manage their own finances. The mother's reaction and attempts to control the author's possessions after moving out are concerning. The author isn't in the wrong for deciding to live independently and stop contributing financially once they're no longer part of the household. The mother's behavior is more at fault here for not respecting the author's decision and trying to hold them accountable beyond the initial arrangement.\n"
