I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out of their mom's house into a place with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and is treating the author like a babysitter for their brother since the parents split. The author isn't paying rent anymore and is only offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a formal agreement. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here. The mom might have been using the rent as a form of child support or to cover childcare, but that's not the author's responsibility once they're adults. \n\nThen there's the emotional and familial aspect. The author feels they were being used as a babysitter, which is a valid concern. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for their own independence. \n\nThe part about the dog is a bit tricky. If the dog is legally the mom's pet, the author isn't obligated to pay for it, but offering $50 shows they're trying to be fair. The mom demanding more money for other bills is unreasonable. \n\nThe mom blocking the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. The author might need to involve the police for a civil standby, which indicates the mom's actions are overstepping. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice to move out, set boundaries, and aren't legally responsible for their mom's bills post-move. The mom's behavior is more about her own financial issues and not respecting the author's independence. So the answer should be B.\n"
