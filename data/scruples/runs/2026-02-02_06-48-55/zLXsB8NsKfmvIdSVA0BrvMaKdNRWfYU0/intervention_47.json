I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person is almost 20 and wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. They mention their parents split up a couple of years ago, and their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter for their younger brother. The mom sees her friend with benefits multiple times a week, while the author only sees their boyfriend once or twice. The author is moving out, and the mom is furious because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. She's also upset about not having someone to watch the brother. The author refuses to pay more than $50/month for their dog's food and grooming. The mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings, leading the author to consider calling the cops.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about others' opinions.\n\nFirst, let's consider legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving out, so the obligation to pay rent would end. The mom is upset about losing the $300, but if the author is moving out, they're not required to keep paying. The $50 for the dog's care seems reasonable as a separate agreement, maybe out of goodwill or to maintain some responsibility for the dog.\n\nThe mom's reaction is about not being able to afford childcare for the brother. However, the author isn't the one responsible for caring for the brother; they were forced into that role by the mom. The author's main issue is the mom's expectation of continued financial support after moving out. The mom is treating the author's rent as a personal financial need, which might not be fair, especially since the author is becoming independent.\n\nThe mom's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. Legally, a parent can't prevent a child from taking their personal belongings, especially if they're of age. The author might need to involve authorities to reclaim their property, which the mom is withholding out of spite or financial pressure.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to create boundaries and gain independence. The mom's demands for continued financial support after the author has moved out are unreasonable. The author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent once they've left. The $50 for the dog is a separate matter and could be seen as a reasonable gesture, not a continuation of rent.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the author might have a moral obligation if there were prior financial agreements or if the mom is struggling. But given the context, the author is moving out to create a healthier environment and has personal bills to manage. The mom's behavior seems more about control and financial benefit rather than genuine need.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't obligated to pay rent after moving out. The mom's actions are problematic, and the author is justified in seeking to reclaim their belongings. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
