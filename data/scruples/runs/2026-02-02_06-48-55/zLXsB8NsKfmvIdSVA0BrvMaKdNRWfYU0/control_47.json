I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the user is almost 20 and wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities, and the user mentions it's a good deal. The main reason they want to move out is because their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The user refuses to pay more than $50 a month for the dog's expenses, and the mom is now trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, the user is moving out, which is their right. They're an adult almost 20, so they have the right to live independently. The mom is treating them as a live-in babysitter, which isn't fair. The user isn't legally obligated to pay rent to their parent once they move out. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than genuine concern for the user. The user is offering $50 for the dog, which is reasonable since they still have a responsibility to the pet. The mom's refusal to let them take their belongings is a red flag; she can't legally prevent them from taking their own property. The user might need to involve authorities to retrieve their stuff, which the user is considering. \n\nThe key points here are the user's right to move out, the mom's unreasonable demands for continued financial support, and the legal right to personal property. The user isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom's behavior is more problematic here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
