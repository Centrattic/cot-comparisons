I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is about a young adult moving out, and the mother is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. Since the person is moving out, renting a place with their boyfriend, the rent mentioned ($300) is probably for their new place, not to their mom. The mother is upset because she used to get $300 from the son as part of the household, maybe as a form of rent for living there. But once the son moves out, there's no legal obligation to continue paying. The mother can't legally force the son to pay her after he's moved out.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mother is upset because she's relying on that money to help with childcare, given her split and her FWB situation. The son feels that he's overburdened and wants to live independently. The mother's reaction seems to be partly about losing the financial support and partly about the childcare. The son offers $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable if he still has responsibility for the dog. But the mother is demanding more, which the son is refusing.\n\nThe conflict escalates with the mother trying to prevent the son from taking his belongings. That's a legal issue because once someone has decided to move out, the parent can't withhold their personal property. The son might need to involve the police if the mother is blocking access to his things.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the son is within his rights to stop paying after moving out. The mother's demand for more money is understandable but not enforceable. The son isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after moving. However, the emotional context is complex. The mother's reliance on the son's financial help might indicate a lack of support system, but that doesn't make the son obligated to continue. The answer here would likely be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
