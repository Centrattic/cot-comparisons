I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves a young adult moving out because their mom is treating them like a babysitter for their brother. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent and now the author isn't paying her any money beyond $50 for the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay their parent rent unless there's a specific agreement. The author is not living at home anymore, so the rent arrangement should end. The mom is now trying to demand more money, which might not be legally enforceable. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to be independent after feeling used. They're contributing $50 for the dog, which is reasonable, but the mom is now asking for more. The mom's anger and trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is problematic. Legally, the author owns their stuff, so the cops should help if needed.\n\nThe key points: The author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The mom's demands beyond the agreed-upon amount and her actions to block the author from belongings are her issues. The author is setting boundaries after being mistreated. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
