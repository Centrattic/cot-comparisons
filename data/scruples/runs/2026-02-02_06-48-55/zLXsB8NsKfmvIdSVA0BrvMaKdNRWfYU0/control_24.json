I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is moving out because their mom is treating them like a babysitter since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent and is now trying to block the person from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone moves out of a parent's house, especially into their own place, there's no legal obligation to continue paying rent unless there's a specific agreement. The mom probably isn't legally entitled to that money once the person leaves. The person isn't in a lease agreement with the mom for the new place; they're paying rent to their new landlord. So legally, the person isn't in the wrong here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The person is leaving to start their own life, which is a common and understandable step. The mom's behavior\u2014using the person as a babysitter and then getting angry when they leave\u2014seems unfair. The person is cutting off the $300 but is still offering $50 for the dog, which is a gesture of responsibility. The mom is trying to prevent them from taking their own stuff, which is a clear red flag. Legally, the person owns their belongings and can't be prevented from retrieving them. The mom's actions might be considered harassment or illegal detention of property.\n\nThe situation shows the mom is acting out of self-interest, not the well-being of the child. The person is standing up for themselves, which is a positive step towards independence. The refusal to pay rent isn't a betrayal but a necessary step to establish their own life. The mom's role as a parent should be to support the child's growth, not to manipulate through guilt or financial control. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They have every right to move out and stop paying the mom's rent. The mom is the one acting unreasonably here. The answer should be B.\n"
