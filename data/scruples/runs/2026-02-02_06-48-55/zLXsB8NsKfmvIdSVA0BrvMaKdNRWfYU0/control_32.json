I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 and had been using the author as a babysitter for the brother. The author is only offering $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more. The mom is now trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. But maybe there's a different angle. Did the author have an agreement to pay rent while living at home? If they were a minor, they might not have been responsible for rent anyway. But the author is almost 20, so maybe they were paying rent as part of an arrangement. However, once they move out, that agreement would presumably end.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mother is upset because she was using the author's \"rent\" (which might have been part of the author's allowance or contributions while living at home) to cover other household costs. The author is now moving out and wants to stop contributing, which the mother is resisting. The author is also trying to take their belongings, which they bought, and the mom is trying to stop them. Legally, the author owns their belongings, so the mom can't prevent them from taking them. The author might need to involve authorities if necessary.\n\nThe author is offering $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable if they're still responsible for the dog. But the mom's demands for more money are beyond that. The author isn't obligated to pay for other bills if they're no longer living under the same roof.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're moving out, not required to pay rent anymore, and the mom is being unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
