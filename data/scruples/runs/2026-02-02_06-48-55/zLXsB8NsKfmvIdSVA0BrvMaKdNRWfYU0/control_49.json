I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out of their mom's house because she's been treating them like a babysitter for their brother. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and is now trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying rent unless there's a lease agreement that still applies. Since the author is moving out, they probably aren't legally responsible for the rent anymore. The mom might be acting out of anger, not legal grounds.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author feels they were being overworked, babysitting to allow their mom to have a social life. The mom is now trying to get financial help, but the author is setting boundaries. It's understandable that the author wants to move out and not be responsible for their mom's bills, especially since they have their own expenses.\n\nThe mom's reaction is extreme\u2014blocking the author from taking their belongings. Legally, the author owns their stuff, so the mom can't prevent that. The author might need to involve the police to reclaim their property, which the mom's actions could be considered illegal.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves after feeling used and aren't responsible for their mom's financial situation after moving out. The mom's demands are unreasonable and shouldn't be expected from the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
