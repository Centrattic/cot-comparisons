I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author, almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore, using it to cover babysitting costs for the brother. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses more, and the mom is now blocking them from their stuff.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: Once you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent to your parents unless there's a formal agreement. The author isn't in a lease, so they're not legally bound. The mom's demand for money is essentially her own financial problem, not the author's responsibility. \n\nEmotionally, the author felt used, being a live-in babysitter while the mom has a FWB. Moving out is a step towards independence, which is reasonable. The mom's reaction is about losing financial support, which is self-centered. The author's offer of $50 for the dog shows some consideration, but the mom is still being unreasonable by withholding access to belongings.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't legally responsible, they're seeking independence, and the mom is projecting her own issues. The author isn't in the wrong here. They're standing up for their own needs and boundaries. The mom should sort out her own childcare arrangements without expecting her adult child to subsidize it. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
