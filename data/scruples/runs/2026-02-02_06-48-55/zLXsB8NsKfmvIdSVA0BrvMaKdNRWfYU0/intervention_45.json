I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is moving out of their mom's house and into a place with their boyfriend and friends where the rent is $300 per person. They want to refuse paying their mom rent after moving out because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter for their brother, especially since their parents split up. The mom is upset because she expected the $300 monthly payment and can't afford to pay someone else for the brother's care. The person is offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming. Mom is now trying to block them from taking their stuff, so they might need to call the cops for a civil standby.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: When you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent to your parents unless you had a prior agreement. The original situation was that they were living at home, and now they're moving to a place where they pay $300. The mom is upset because she's losing that \"income.\" Legally, if there was no contract or agreement, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying. But maybe in some cases, if they were still under 18 or in a specific arrangement, but the author is almost 20, which is an adult in most places.\n\nEthically, the author is moving out to be with their partner and friends, which is a valid reason. The mom might be using the financial aspect as leverage, but the author's decision to leave is about their own life and needs. The $50 for the dog is reasonable, especially if they had a prior arrangement where they covered the dog's expenses. The mom's reaction\u2014calling the author a brat and trying to block their stuff\u2014seems more about resentment over losing financial support rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nThe mom's situation: She's having trouble affording to pay someone for her brother's care. However, that's her responsibility now that the son is moving out. The author isn't legally required to support their brother unless there's a custody agreement, but since they're moving out, it's their choice. The mom's anger is misplaced if the author is now self-sufficient.\n\nThe author is almost 20, so they're likely an adult and can make their own decisions. The fact that the mom was treating them as a babysitter before moving out might be part of the issue. The author is asserting their independence, which is understandable. The refusal to pay rent is because they already have a new place, and the mom was upset about the loss of income, which isn't the author's duty unless they agreed to it in advance.\n\nThe key points are legal obligation vs. moral obligation. Legally, no. Morally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're moving out and the mom's demands are about financial support she wasn't entitled to. The author is even trying to maintain some support for the dog, which shows consideration. The mom's actions (blocking belongings) are more aggressive and possibly illegal, so the author might be justified in taking that step.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
