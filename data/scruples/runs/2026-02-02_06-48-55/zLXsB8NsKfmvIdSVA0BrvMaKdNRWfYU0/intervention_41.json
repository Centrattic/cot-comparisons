I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the author, almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore, as she's been using the author to watch their brother. The author isn't taking the dog, so they offer $50 a month for the dog's care. The mom demands more money, and now she's trying to block the author from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. When someone moves out, they're typically not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a prior agreement. The author isn't in a lease agreement with their mom, so refusing to pay after moving out seems reasonable. The mom's argument about not being able to afford childcare is her issue, not the author's. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for independence.\n\nThe mom's reaction\u2014calling the author an \"ungrateful brat\" and trying to withhold belongings\u2014is problematic. Legally, the author owns their belongings and can't be prevented from taking them. The mom's threats might be a civil issue, and calling the police for a civil standby makes sense if needed.\n\nThe author's offer of $50 for dog care shows they're trying to be fair. However, the mom is demanding more, which is unreasonable. The core issue is the author's right to move out and the mom's adjustment to that change. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and independence. So, the answer should be B\u2014author not in the wrong.\n"
