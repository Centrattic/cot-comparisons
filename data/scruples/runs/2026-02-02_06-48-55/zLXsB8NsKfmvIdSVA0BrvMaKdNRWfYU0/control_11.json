I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. They've informed their mom, who's upset because they were contributing $300 a month towards her bills. The mom is acting like it's a big deal, even to the point of trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving out, so it's reasonable they don't want to pay anymore. The mom might see it as them cutting off financial support, but that's not the author's responsibility. The mom had other arrangements (like the FWB) before the author left, so it's her responsibility to manage her own household now. \n\nThe author is offering $50 for the dog's care, which is a gesture, but they aren't required to pay more. The mom's reaction seems more about losing the money than the childcare. The author's main issue was the mother treating them like a babysitter, so moving out is a way to set boundaries. The mom's trying to block them from taking their stuff is a red flag, but that's her issue, not the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
