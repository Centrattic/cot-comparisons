I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The mom is upset because she was getting money from the author as rent, which she used to help with babysitting her brother. The author is cutting off the payments and only offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom was getting $300, but that was likely informal, not a contract. The author isn't responsible for the mom's financial situation after moving out.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. The author feels they were being used as a babysitter, which is understandable. Moving out is a significant step towards independence, and the author is asserting their autonomy. The mom's reaction is extreme, trying to block the author from taking their belongings. This could be a sign of financial dependence or control issues on the mom's part.\n\nThe author is offering to help with the dog, which is a gesture of goodwill. The mom's demand for more money and the threat to take the author to court over moving out might be about control rather than actual financial need. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're not legally obligated to continue payments and have a right to their own life and financial independence.\n\nAlso, the mom's actions (trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff) are problematic. The author might need to involve authorities to retrieve their belongings, which is a red flag about the mom's behavior. The author is standing up for themselves, which is the right thing to do.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice to move out, and the mom's reaction is about financial and emotional control. The answer should be B.\n"
