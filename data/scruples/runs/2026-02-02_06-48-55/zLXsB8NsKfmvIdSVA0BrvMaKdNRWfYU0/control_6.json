I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is moving out at 19.9 years old, which is essentially an adult. They want to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person for rent and utilities. The mom is upset because she was using the child as a live-in babysitter since the parents split. The mom is angry and claims she can't afford to pay someone else for the 3-4 nights a week.\n\nThe author refuses to pay rent after moving out, offering $50 a month for the dog's care. The mom is now blocking access to the author's belongings, leading to a potential police call. The key points here are: the author is an adult moving out, the mom's behavior is using the child as a babysitter, the author isn't staying in the house anymore, and thus not required to pay rent post-move. The mom's claim about needing the money is about her own financial issues, not the author's responsibility once they're out. The author is within their rights to stop paying rent since they're no longer residing in the home. The mom's attempt to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
