She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend using the possibility of having sex as a condition for the author not playing video games all day. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author wanted to play games before their girlfriend arrived, but she made it a condition that if he wants to have sex, he can't play any games at all that day. The author felt this was a power play, using sex as leverage to control his behavior.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect in a relationship. When one person uses a sexual act as a bargaining chip for another's behavior, it can be seen as a form of manipulation. The author is correct in pointing out that the offer doesn't benefit both parties equally. The girlfriend gets to have sex, but the author is giving up something he wants (playing games) without reciprocal benefit. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that she's making an offer, not a demand. But the line between an offer and a power play can be thin. If the offer is conditional on the other person's compliance with a demand (not playing games all day), it's more like a power move. The author isn't wrong to feel uncomfortable with that, as healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and consent without coercion. \n\nThe author's reaction is justified because using sex as leverage can be problematic. It's not about the games but the control aspect. The girlfriend's response not seeing it as a power play suggests a lack of understanding of the issue. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions do constitute a power play, so the answer should be B.\n"
