She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about whether they should have sex during their time together, and how that's linked to playing video games.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially asked not to have sex so they could do other activities. The author agreed, and they planned to cook dinner and maybe play games. Then, the author suggested playing video games, and when he expressed interest in that, the girlfriend offered that if he doesn't play games at all (even before she arrives), then they can have sex. The author felt this was using sex as a power play, while the girlfriend sees it as an offer.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The author feels that the girlfriend is trying to control the situation by withholding sex unless he complies with her conditions. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be trying to balance both activities, wanting to have sex but also wanting to play games with him. However, the author's main issue is that he feels pressured to give up something (his gaming time) to get another activity (sex), which he perceives as a power move.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend did offer the sex conditional on him not playing games at all. The author then tried to negotiate, saying he could play before she arrives, but she refused, leading to the breakdown. The problem arises because the girlfriend's condition is all-or-nothing: either he gives up gaming entirely for the day (including before they meet) or they don't have sex. From the author's perspective, this is using sex as a bargaining chip, which can indeed be seen as manipulative if one party is using the other's desires against them to get their way.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not see it that way. She might be trying to prioritize intimacy over gaming, especially since they often have sex and she wants to focus on other activities. But if she's only offering sex as a reward for giving up gaming, it could be a power imbalance. The author's frustration is valid because he feels his autonomy is being compromised.\n\nBut another angle: if both parties have different needs and expectations, communication is key. The author could have expressed his feelings about the offer being a power play, and maybe they could have found a middle ground. Instead, the author rejected the offer and accused her, leading to a breakup. The question is whether the author overreacted by not considering her perspective. Maybe the girlfriend was just trying to balance her own needs without realizing how it came across. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs, but using sex as a condition can be problematic if it's not mutual. The author's stance that he shouldn't have to sacrifice his gaming time for sex is reasonable, but his reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and \"power play\" might have been harsh, leading to conflict. The girlfriend's offer, while understandable, might not have been the best approach. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's intention was genuine and not manipulative, then the author might be overstepping by labeling it a power play without understanding her perspective. However, if using sex as a condition for other activities is inherently manipulative, then the author is right to push back. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the key here is whether the girlfriend's offer was a manipulative tactic or a genuine suggestion. If she was trying to balance both activities but the author felt pressured, then both sides have valid points. However, the author's reaction of calling her out as manipulative without discussing it further might have escalated the situation. Communication breakdown is a factor here. But given the situation as described, the author's perspective is that he's not okay with being controlled in that way. Whether he's wrong depends on the context of their relationship and past interactions. \n\nGiven the information, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries. However, his approach could have been more constructive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach was the best. Since using sex as a condition can be seen as a power play, his reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
