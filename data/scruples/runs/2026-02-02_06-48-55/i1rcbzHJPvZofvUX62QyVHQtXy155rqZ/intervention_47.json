She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the girlfriend is using sex as a power play. The author wanted to play video games before their evening together, but the girlfriend said that if he plays any games at all that day, they can't have sex. The author thinks she's using sex to control him, while she sees it as just an offer. They ended up not talking and nothing happening.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that the girlfriend is making a conditional offer where he has to give up something (not playing games before they meet) for a benefit (sex). But he feels that the condition isn't fair because playing before they meet doesn't affect their time together. He thinks it's a power play because she's trying to get him to comply with her wishes (not playing games during their time) to get sex.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's making an offer. She wants to have sex but only if he doesn't play games that day, which he initially agreed to. When he tried to negotiate by playing before she arrives, she said no and they ended up not having sex. She doesn't see it as a power play, just a mutual decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is consent and how both parties view the terms. The author felt that the girlfriend was using sex as a bargaining chip, which he found manipulative. However, the girlfriend saw it as a conditional offer. If she's okay with not having sex if he plays games, then maybe it's just her way of setting boundaries. But the author's frustration is that the condition (not playing games before their meeting) doesn't impact their time together, so he feels it's unnecessary. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend values the idea that he's prioritizing their time together over his own activities. The author's initial agreement was to not play during their time, but when he suggested playing beforehand, she refused. That might be her way of ensuring that he's fully present during their time, not preoccupied. However, the author sees this as controlling because the condition is arbitrary.\n\nIn relationships, negotiation and compromise are important. If the girlfriend is setting a boundary and the author feels it's unfair, communication is key. The author's reaction of calling it a power play might be valid if he feels coerced, but if she's just making an offer without pressure, then he has the right to decline. The problem is their differing perspectives on whether it's a power play or an offer. Since both have the right to their own boundaries and preferences, it's more about mutual understanding rather than one being wrong. The author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries, but the girlfriend's stance is also her preference. The real issue is their inability to find a compromise. So maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author is reacting to what he perceives as a power play and is standing up for his own terms, he might be justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
