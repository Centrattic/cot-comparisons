She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend not wanting to have sex that night and then making a conditional offer that if he doesn't play video games all day, they can have sex. The author is upset because he feels she's using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author agreed not to play games during their time together but suggested he could play before she arrives. The girlfriend then insists that in order to have sex, he can't play games at all that day. The author feels this is manipulative because there's no benefit to her if he gives up playing games, just a punishment if he doesn't comply.\n\nThe girlfriend argues it's just an offer and he can decline. The author feels it's a power play because she's withholding sex unless he gives up something. Now, they're not talking, and nothing's happening that night.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and consent. The author thinks she's using sex as a bargaining chip, which can be considered a form of manipulation. The girlfriend sees it as a mutual decision. But the author's concern is that the offer isn't balanced; he's giving up something (gaming time) for her benefit (sex), which she can withhold. That imbalance might be the issue.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should feel that their needs and boundaries are respected. If one partner uses a fundamental part of the relationship (like sex) as a conditional exchange for something else, it can create resentment. However, if both parties agree to such terms voluntarily, some might see it as a personal choice. But the line between a mutual agreement and a power play can be blurry.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he's being asked to sacrifice something personal for her to grant something she's otherwise willing to provide. The girlfriend might not realize that her request is perceived as manipulative. However, she did present it as an offer, and he had the choice to decline. But the author's right to feel that his autonomy is being disregarded is also a factor.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer might hinge on whether using sex as a condition is inherently manipulative or if it's a matter of differing perspectives. Since the author feels wronged and the girlfriend doesn't, it's a communication issue. But if using sex as a bargaining chip is considered a power play, then the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if both parties are consenting adults making their own choices, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nHowever, the main issue here is mutual understanding and respect. The author's perspective is that the girlfriend is using a basic right (sex) as a bargaining chip for something that's not equally beneficial to her. That can be seen as a power imbalance. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
