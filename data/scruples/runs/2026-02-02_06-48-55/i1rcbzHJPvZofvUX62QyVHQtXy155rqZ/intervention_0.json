She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting to spend time without sex and then suggesting they can have sex if he doesn't play video games at all that day. The author thinks she's using sex as a power play, while she sees it as an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend initially asked not to have sex to have a different kind of date night, which the author agreed to. Then, when the author suggests playing games during their time together, she offers that they can have sex if he gives up all gaming that day. The author feels this is a manipulation tactic, while she sees it as a mutual decision.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author argues that the offer isn't balanced because he's giving up something (gaming before they meet) but only getting sex in return, which she might not get any benefit from. However, the girlfriend sees it as an option, not a punishment. The author then accuses her of using sex as a power play, which is a strong claim. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are met and that decisions are made collaboratively. If one partner is using a conditional statement (if you do X, then I'll do Y), it can sometimes be seen as a form of manipulation if it's not a balanced exchange. The author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to sacrifice his activities for her, but the girlfriend might not see it as power play but as a personal choice for intimacy.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and \"power play\" might come off as confrontational, which could escalate the situation. The girlfriend might have been trying to find a compromise, and the author's response might have been too harsh without understanding her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is making conditions that require the author to give up something without a clear mutual benefit, that could be an issue. The author's point about the offer not being beneficial to her is valid if she doesn't derive any value from him not gaming before they meet. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be overreacting by labeling it a power play, but the girlfriend's conditional offer could also be seen as manipulative. However, since the author was the one to accuse her of a power play and escalate the conflict, maybe he's more in the wrong here. So I lean towards A (author in the wrong).\n"
