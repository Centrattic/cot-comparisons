She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and his girlfriend. The author wanted to play video games tonight, but the girlfriend suggested not having sex if he plays games. The author felt like she was using sex as a power play, while she says it's just an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The girlfriend initially didn't want to have sex because they do it often. The author agreed to not have sex that night. Then, when the author suggested playing games, the girlfriend offered sex in exchange for not playing games at all that day. The author agreed but then felt it was a power play because he could play before she arrived. The girlfriend didn't back down, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's perspective is that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's making a mutual offer. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, using sex as a condition for other activities can be seen as a power move if one partner feels pressured or that their autonomy is being compromised. The key here is whether the girlfriend's offer was a genuine mutual exchange or a manipulation tactic. \n\nThe author felt it was a power play because he didn't see a benefit for her in him not playing games before they met. The girlfriend, however, sees it as an offer where both sides get something: he gets sex if he forgoes games. But the issue is that the author felt coerced, even though he had the choice to decline. \n\nIt's possible the girlfriend intended it as a mutual exchange, but the author's reaction indicates he felt disrespected. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable without feeling that their desires are being used as leverage. If one partner feels that their basic wants (like playing games) are being penalized for something else (sex), that could be a red flag. However, if both parties are willing and it's a mutual decision, it might be okay. \n\nBut in this case, the author felt it was one-sided, and the girlfriend didn't see it that way. The fact that the author was able to say \"no problem\" initially when the girlfriend didn't want sex shows he was open to not having sex. But when the offer came with a condition, he felt it was a manipulation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries and not okay with what he perceives as manipulation. The girlfriend's approach might be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which can be unhealthy. So the answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. Maybe there's a different angle. If the girlfriend's offer was meant as a mutual choice, then it's not a power play. But the author's discomfort is valid. It's a difference in how they view the negotiation. Since the author is standing up for himself, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
