She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author is in a relationship and was trying to make plans with his girlfriend. She wanted to have a different activity than their usual sex, so she suggested not having sex that night. The author agreed. Later, when discussing activities, the author suggested playing video games, but the girlfriend wanted to do something together. The author wanted to play games, and the girlfriend then made a conditional offer: if he didn't play video games at all that day (including before she arrived), they could have sex that night. The author felt this was using sex as a power play and got upset, leading to a fight and no plans.\n\nNow, the core issue here is whether the girlfriend's conditional offer constitutes using sex as a power play. The author believes she is manipulating him by withholding sex unless he complies with her conditions. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as just an offer and a difference in opinion.\n\nPower play in relationships often involves using control or manipulation to get one's way. If one partner is using a conditional offer where the other feels pressured to comply, that could be seen as a power dynamic. However, if the offer is mutual and both parties are willing to accept the terms, it might not be. The key here is whether the girlfriend is using sex as leverage to get the author to do what she wants, rather than it being a genuine mutual decision.\n\nThe author agreed not to play games during their time together, but the girlfriend extended the condition to before she arrived. The author felt this was unreasonable because playing before she arrives doesn't affect their time together. The girlfriend's condition might be seen as an attempt to control his behavior outside their time together, which could be a form of power play. However, if she genuinely saw it as an offer without pressure, maybe not. But the author's interpretation is that it was a power move, and she didn't see it that way.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend wanted to have sex, which is her right, but the author feels that her condition is unfair. If the author is willing to give up games before she arrives to have sex, but the girlfriend is not willing to negotiate further, it might be a matter of differing priorities. However, using sex as a reward for compliance could be seen as manipulative if it's done to gain control.\n\nThe author's reaction was to accuse her of using sex as a power play, which she denies. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that accusation. If the girlfriend's offer was indeed a genuine suggestion without manipulation, then the author might be misinterpreting her intentions. However, if the author's feeling of being manipulated is valid, then the girlfriend might be the one in the wrong. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the author's accusation is justified.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author felt pressured and communicated that, maybe the girlfriend should have considered his feelings. But if the author is overreacting to a legitimate offer, he might be the one at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's main point is that the condition is unreasonable because it doesn't affect their time together, and the girlfriend is using sex as leverage to get him to stop gaming entirely. Since playing before she arrives doesn't interfere with their plans, the girlfriend's condition might be an attempt to control his behavior beyond their time together, which could be seen as a power play. Therefore, the author might be justified in his feelings, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for the way he handled it.\n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend was simply presenting an option without pressure, the author's reaction could be unwarranted. However, the fact that he felt it was a power play and she didn't see it that way might indicate a misunderstanding or differing views on healthy relationship dynamics. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for accusing her of manipulation when she didn't intend it. However, if the situation is a textbook example of using sex as a bargaining chip, then the author is correct.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's offer was manipulative. Since she offered the deal, and the author felt it was a power play, but she didn't see it that way, it's possible that the author is correct in his assessment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for his actions. If he accused her of using sex as a power play without considering her perspective, maybe he's at fault. But if his interpretation is valid, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nGiven that the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion, I need to decide. I think the author's main issue is that the girlfriend is using sex to get him to comply with her condition, which is a form of manipulation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
