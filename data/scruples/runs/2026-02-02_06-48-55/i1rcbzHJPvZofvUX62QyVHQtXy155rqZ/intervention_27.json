She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wanted to plan a night with their girlfriend. She asked not to have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to just chill. The author agreed. Then they discussed activities, and the author suggested playing video games. The girlfriend then offered that if he didn't play games at all that day, they could have sex. The author felt she was using sex as a power play and got upset. The girlfriend doesn't see it that way, and now they're not speaking.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual consent and negotiation in a relationship. The author feels that the girlfriend is manipulating the situation by making sex conditional on him not playing games, even before their time together. The girlfriend thinks it's just an offer where both could benefit. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might be right in feeling that the girlfriend is using a conditional offer that pressures him to give up an activity (games) for a specific reason (sex). On the other hand, the girlfriend might see it as a way to express her preference for intimacy over him gaming before their time together. \n\nBut wait, the author clarified that he could play games before she arrived, but she insisted on no games the entire day. His objection is that the condition is unnecessary and uses sex as leverage. The girlfriend, however, might feel that she's just expressing her desire for intimacy when possible. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are respected without manipulation. If one partner uses a conditional offer where the other feels pressured to give up something without mutual benefit, that can be a power play. Here, the benefit for the girlfriend in the author not playing games (other than having sex) isn't clear. So the author might be right in feeling it's a power play. However, the girlfriend might not see it the same way. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author accused her of using sex as a power play, maybe he's overreacting if she didn't intend it that way. But if her offer is indeed using sex as a conditional reward for him giving up something (gaming), even if she doesn't see it as a power play, the author's feelings are valid. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, both could have handled it better. The author's frustration stems from feeling that his activity (gaming) is being restricted for a reason he doesn't agree with. The girlfriend might feel her needs for intimacy aren't being met. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but maybe could have approached it differently. Similarly, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong for making an offer she sees as neutral. However, using conditional sex as an ultimatum can be a form of manipulation. Since the author's main issue is that the condition was unnecessary and a power play, and the girlfriend doesn't see it that way, it might be a difference in perspectives. \n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong. If they accused her of a power play without considering her perspective, maybe they are. However, if the situation does involve that dynamic, then they're justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's interpretation of a power play is valid. In relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries, but also to communicate effectively. The author might be in the right to express his feelings, but if he dismissed her feelings as manipulative without discussion, that could be problematic. However, the act of making a conditional offer based on an activity that doesn't affect the time they're together could be seen as a power play. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's offer could be a manipulative tactic, even if unintentional. The author is justified in feeling that way. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
