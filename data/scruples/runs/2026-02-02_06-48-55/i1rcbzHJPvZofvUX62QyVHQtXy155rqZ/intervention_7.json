She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to have sex one night and then offering it as a trade for him not playing video games at any time that day, including before she arrives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is planning to cook dinner and spend the evening with his girlfriend. She initially says she doesn't want to have sex that night. He agrees, and they start discussing other activities, like gaming. Then she suggests that if he doesn't play games at all that day (including before she arrives), they can have sex. He objects, thinking it's a power play because he thinks the time before she arrives shouldn't matter. He calls her out on using sex as a power move, and they end up not talking anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a reward to get him to comply with her conditions. The author thinks she's manipulating him, while she claims it's just an offer. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking that.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. If she's using sex as a reward or punishment, that could be a form of control. However, the girlfriend might feel that she's just trying to balance their time together, ensuring that they have quality time without distractions. But the author's point is that the time before she arrives isn't relevant because it's not during their hangout time. He's willing to skip games during their time together but not beforehand. She's extending the condition to all day, which he finds unreasonable.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using conditional offers like this. If one partner uses something as intimate as sex as a reward, it could lead to resentment or pressure. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not see it that way and thinks it's a fair compromise. The problem is the author feels it's a power play, and they can't agree.\n\nThe key here is that the girlfriend is setting a condition that the author doesn't feel is fair. The fact that he's upset and called it a power play suggests that he perceives it as manipulative. The girlfriend's response that it's an offer might not acknowledge his feelings. However, the author could also be overreacting if the girlfriend didn't intend it as a power play but just wanted to have sex if he could be fully present.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his discomfort with the condition. It's important for both partners to communicate and find a middle ground. Since they couldn't agree and the situation escalated, it's a communication breakdown. However, the author's stance is based on his perception of fairness, so he's not necessarily wrong for thinking she's using a power play, even if she didn't intend it that way.\n"
