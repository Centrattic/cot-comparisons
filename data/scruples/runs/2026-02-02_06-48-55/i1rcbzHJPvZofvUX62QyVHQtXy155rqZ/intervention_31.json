She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting to spend time without sex, and then later offering sex in exchange for him not playing video games on his own. \n\nFirst, the author initially agrees to not have sex and plans alternative activities. Then, the girlfriend changes the offer, requiring him to give up playing games entirely that day to have sex. The author feels this is using sex as a power play because the benefit (sex) is one-sided\u2014she gets to have sex, but he gives up his gaming time for no reciprocal benefit. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual respect. The girlfriend's condition seems to be a form of conditional sex, where she's using the possibility of sex as a bargaining chip. The author argues that this is manipulative because the benefit isn't mutual. The girlfriend, however, sees it as an offer that he's free to accept or decline.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are respected without using such conditions. If one partner is using a desired activity or physical intimacy as leverage, it can be seen as a power play. The author's frustration comes from feeling pressured to sacrifice his time and enjoyment for hers, which isn't a balanced exchange. \n\nHowever, if both parties are adults and the offer is consensual, some might argue it's a difference in negotiation styles. But the issue arises when one side feels coerced or that the exchange is unfair. The author's main point is that the offer isn't beneficial to both sides, making it a power move. The girlfriend's refusal to see it that way and the resulting breakdown in communication might indicate a lack of understanding of each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering whether using sex as a conditional reward without mutual benefit is a power play, the author's perspective seems valid. He's standing up for his own needs and boundaries, which is healthy. On the other hand, the girlfriend's approach could be problematic if she's not open to compromise. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
