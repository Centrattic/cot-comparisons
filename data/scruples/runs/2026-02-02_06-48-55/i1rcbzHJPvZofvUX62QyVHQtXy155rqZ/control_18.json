She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the night. The girlfriend initially says she doesn't want to have sex because they do it often and wants to just chill. The author agrees and suggests video games. Then the girlfriend offers that if he doesn't play games during their time together, they can have sex. The author feels like she's using sex as a power play because he wants to play before she arrives, and she insists it's an offer, not a power move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thinks that the girlfriend is using sex as a way to control the situation. He feels that his choice to play games before she arrives shouldn't affect their plans for the night. He's upset because he sees this as a manipulation tactic. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that she's just making a reciprocal offer\u2014no games during their time together in exchange for sex. She might think it's a fair trade and not a power play.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author agreed to not play games during the evening but wanted to play before she came over. The girlfriend clarified that it's not allowed at all, including before. The author felt this was unreasonable, leading to an argument. The girlfriend says it's an offer, but the author sees it as a manipulation. Both are in a position where their needs aren't being fully met. The author wants to play games before the visit, and the girlfriend wants physical intimacy without gaming during their time together. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, making a trade where one party has to give up something (gaming before) for a potential benefit (sex) might be seen as a power play if the benefit is something the other person wants but the first person is using as leverage. However, the girlfriend might not see it that way. The author is correct in pointing out that the benefit is one-sided for her, but he might have overreacted by calling it \"fucked up\" and not considering her feelings. \n\nPower dynamics can be subjective. If the girlfriend feels that she's not using power but making a mutual offer, and the author feels it's manipulative, it's a communication breakdown. The author's response might have been confrontational, leading to the breakdown in their plans. However, he's also right to express his discomfort with using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but his reaction might have been harsh. The girlfriend might not be using a power play, but her offer could be seen as conditional, which the author is valid in addressing. Since both have valid points, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he's standing up for his boundaries and correctly identifying a potential power imbalance, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend genuinely didn't intend it as a power play, but he misinterpreted it, maybe A. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
