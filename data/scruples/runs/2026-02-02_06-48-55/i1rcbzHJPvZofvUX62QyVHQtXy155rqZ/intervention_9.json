She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about plans for the evening.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially refuses having sex and wants to just hang out. The author agrees and suggests playing games. She then offers that if he doesn't play video games at all that day, they can have sex. The author feels this is a power play, especially because he's willing to play before she arrives, but she insists on no games at all. When he pushes back, he accuses her of using sex as a power move. She disagrees, thinking it's just an offer, and now they're not talking.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that the girlfriend is using sex as a reward for not playing games, which he finds manipulative. From his view, the offer doesn't benefit her if he doesn't play before seeing her, so he sees it as a power play. The girlfriend's stance is that she's making a choice and it's an offer he can accept or decline. She might not see it as manipulation but as a mutual decision.\n\nPower dynamics in relationships can be tricky. Using something like sex as a condition for another activity might be seen as a power play if one partner feels coerced. However, if both parties agree to such terms and it's a mutual decision without pressure, it might be seen as a legitimate negotiation. The key here is consent and mutual understanding. \n\nThe author might have overreacted by calling it a power play, especially if the girlfriend didn't intend it that way. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is consistently using such tactics, it could be a pattern of behavior worth addressing. The author's frustration is valid if he feels his autonomy is being challenged. However, his reaction might have been harsh, leading to the breakdown in communication.\n\nConsidering that the girlfriend didn't force the issue and left it open for him to decline, maybe the author is in the right to express his discomfort. But if the girlfriend's offer was a genuine mutual choice and not a manipulation, the author might be misinterpreting her intentions. The difference in perspective here is significant. The author's accusation of a power play could be seen as an overreaction, especially since the girlfriend gave him the option to say no. However, if the author feels uncomfortable with the conditions, he's within his rights to express that. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be right to set boundaries if he feels used, but his approach led to the argument. The girlfriend's approach might not be malicious but a different way of negotiating. It's possible both have valid points but need to communicate better. Based on the information, the author might not be in the wrong for setting those boundaries, but he could have handled it more constructively. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering his perspective and the girlfriend's reaction, maybe the answer is B (No).\n"
