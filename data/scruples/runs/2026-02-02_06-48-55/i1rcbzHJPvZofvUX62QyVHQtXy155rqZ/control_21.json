She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend initially didn't want to have sex that night and wanted to do other things. The author agreed. Then, when discussing plans, she offered sex if he forgoes playing video games entirely for the day, not just during their time together. He felt this was a power play because he thought his agreement to not play games before she arrived (which was two hours prior) was unnecessary. He got upset and called it holding sex over his head. She didn't see it that way and they ended up not talking.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend made a condition for sex that the author felt was unreasonable. The author felt it was a power play because he didn't see a benefit for him, only for her. From his perspective, he agreed to not play during their time, but she extended it to before they met. He saw it as a manipulation tactic. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that she's having open communication about her needs and that making a mutual decision is fair. However, using sex as a conditional trade where one party's desires are prioritized without mutual benefit could be seen as a power play. The author is justified in feeling that his needs aren't being respected if he's being asked to forgo his own activities (gaming) for a condition that benefits only her. \n\nBut did the author overreact? It's possible. He could have tried to understand her perspective better instead of immediately calling it a power play. However, the initial request did seem to impose an unnecessary condition. The fact that she clarified after his initial agreement shows she might have been testing his limits. The author's frustration is valid because he felt manipulated. \n\nSo considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for his reaction. He's standing up for his boundaries and pointing out a potential imbalance in the dynamic. However, the situation is complex because communication is key in relationships. But given the scenario, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
