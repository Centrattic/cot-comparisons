She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a boyfriend and girlfriend regarding sex and video games.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked not to have sex that night because she wants to relax and do other things. The boyfriend initially agrees. Then, she offers to have sex if he forgoes playing video games entirely that day, not just during their time together. The boyfriend feels this is a power play using sex, which he's upset about. The girlfriend sees it as an offer.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The girlfriend made a conditional offer, which the boyfriend found manipulative. But he also agreed to not play games during their evening. The issue is whether using the offer of sex as a condition for not playing games before their time together is a power play.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that the offer only benefits him (sex) and doesn't benefit her, making it a power play. The girlfriend argues it's an offer he can decline. The fact that the condition includes not playing games before she arrives might be where the tension comes from. The boyfriend feels that since the games are before their time together, it shouldn't affect their plans. The girlfriend might feel that the games are a distraction or that she's trying to have a more intimate evening.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should feel respected. If one person feels that their partner is using sex as a bargaining chip, that could be a red flag. However, if both are adults and the offer is consensual, maybe it's just a difference in perspectives. The boyfriend's frustration is valid if he feels pressured or that his partner is using sex to control the situation. The girlfriend might think she's just negotiating terms for a more intimate evening. \n\nBut the key here is whether the boyfriend was given a choice and if there was clear communication. The girlfriend presented an option, and he declined it. The problem is whether her initial offer was manipulative or a genuine suggestion. The boyfriend's reaction might be seen as dismissive if she had the right to set boundaries, but if he felt coerced, that's another issue. \n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's stance is that the offer isn't balanced, and he's not comfortable with it. The girlfriend doesn't see it as a power play. It's a communication breakdown. The author isn't wrong for standing his ground if he feels used, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. However, the girlfriend's approach could be seen as trying to set boundaries for a more intimate evening. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings about how the offer was made, and it's a matter of differing opinions on what constitutes a fair negotiation. Neither side is entirely at fault; it's a communication issue. The author isn't wrong for feeling that using sex as a condition for not playing games (even before their time together) felt manipulative to him.\n"
