She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend are planning a night together. She wants to skip sex because they do it often and wants to just hang out. He agrees not to have sex during their time together but wants to play games before she arrives. She then says that to have sex tonight, he can't play games at all today, including before she comes. He gets upset, calls it a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girl initially asked not to have sex, which he accepted. Then when he suggests games, she offers to have sex if he doesn't play games at all. The author feels that this is using sex to control him, making him give up something personal (playing games) to get sex, which he views unfairly. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is that the offer only benefits him (no games during their hangout = sex) but he had to give up games before. The girl's perspective is that she's setting boundaries and making a mutual agreement. \n\nIs it a power play? A power play implies manipulation for control. If she's using sex as a reward for him complying with her conditions, that could be seen as such. However, the girl might be communicating her own needs and boundaries. She might value the time together without sex and wants him to be fully present. \n\nThe author might not see that her condition is about her comfort and desire for different activities. By agreeing not to have sex during their hangout, he might have taken it as a given, but she's extending that to his personal time before they meet. Maybe he's not respecting her need for the evening to be non-sexual, which is her right. \n\nBut the offer is conditional. She's saying if he doesn't play games today at all, then they can have sex. It's a bit of a \"if you want to have sex, you have to do X\" scenario. That can be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which might be a power play. However, it's also possible that she's trying to ensure he's not distracted by games, so he's more present. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her autonomy in deciding when and how they have sex. Alternatively, he's justified if he feels his own choices before their time together shouldn't impact their evening. \n\nBut the problem is the author's reaction. He called it \"fucked up\" and accused her of a power play. Maybe he should have discussed her boundaries more calmly instead of reacting negatively. The girl is trying to set her terms, which is her right. If the author is okay with having a non-sexual evening, but she's making it conditional on his behavior, that's a conflict in expectations. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for the harsh reaction. However, he's also right in that she's setting a condition that he might not agree with. It's a bit of a gray area. The main question is whether using a conditional offer to get his compliance is a power play or setting a boundary. \n\nIf the girl is okay with no sex if he plays games before, and he's okay with that, but she's trying to make him give up his own time to meet her condition, that could be manipulative. However, if she's simply expressing her desire for the evening to be different and he's choosing to comply, it's a mutual agreement. The author's frustration stems from feeling that the offer is one-sided, but maybe he's not considering her perspective that she wants to be fully engaged without the distraction of games. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are respected. The girl is asserting her need for a non-sexual evening, which is valid. The author is asserting his right to use his personal time before they meet. The conflict arises from the condition she set. Whether that's a power play depends on intent. If she's trying to control him through sex, then yes. But if it's about her own comfort, maybe not. \n\nThe author's reaction was to accuse her of a power play, which might dismiss her legitimate boundaries. So, perhaps he's not wrong in feeling it's a power play, but his response could be seen as invalidating her feelings. \n\nGiven all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't approach her boundary with understanding and instead reacted defensively, potentially undermining her needs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the girl's condition could be a power play, making the author not in the wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe the key is whether the condition is reasonable. If she wants him to not play games during their time together, that's one thing. But extending it to his entire day might be excessive. The author might have a right to his own time. However, by making the offer, she's trying to find a compromise. \n\nI think the author's main mistake was the way he reacted. Instead of discussing her feelings, he accused her of manipulation. So, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation respectfully. But the girl's condition could still be a power play. \n\nGiven the information, the answer is likely A. The author's perspective may not fully respect her boundaries, and his reaction was harsh.\n"
