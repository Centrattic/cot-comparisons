She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple discussing their plans for the evening, specifically around having sex and playing video games.\n\nThe author's girlfriend initially wanted to skip sex to just chill. The author agreed and suggested video games. Then the girlfriend offered that if he didn't play games during their hangout, they could have sex. The author felt this was using sex as a power play because he wanted to play before she arrived, and she wouldn't allow it. He got upset and accused her of holding sex over his head. Now they're not speaking.\n\nSo, the main points here are about power dynamics and communication. The author argues that the offer only benefits him (not playing during their time together leads to sex) but doesn't benefit her. He felt it was a manipulation tactic. The girlfriend, on the other hand, says it was just an offer and not a power play.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the girlfriend's request to not have sex was about wanting to chill, which the author respected. She then proposed a trade-off: no games during their time together in exchange for sex. The author saw this as coercion, while she saw it as a mutual offer.\n\nPower plays in relationships usually involve one person using something (like affection or intimacy) to control the other. The key here is whether the girlfriend was using sex as a leverage. If she was offering it as a reward for his behavior (not playing games), then it could be seen as a power play. However, the author was willing to not play games during their time together, which she wanted, and the offer was for sex. If she's using the sex to get him to comply with her terms, that's a form of manipulation. On the flip side, the author might be overreacting by calling it a power play when she intended it as a lighthearted offer.\n\nBut another angle is about mutual respect. The author wanted to play games before she arrived, but she was insisting that if he played at all that day, they wouldn't have sex. He felt that not playing before she came over shouldn't affect their activities together. The issue might be about boundaries and expectations. The girlfriend might have felt that setting a boundary was necessary for her comfort, while the author felt it was unfair.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author's frustration stemmed from feeling manipulated, but maybe he should have discussed his feelings calmly instead of accusing her. Conversely, the girlfriend might have been trying to express her needs but didn't realize how her words came across.\n\nI think both sides have valid points. The author's reaction might be seen as a misinterpretation of her offer, while she might not have considered how her request could be perceived. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he accused her of using sex as a power play when she didn't intend to, then he might be in the wrong. But if her request was indeed manipulative, then he's right.\n\nBut given the details, it seems the author's main issue is that the offer only benefits him (he gets to have sex by not playing during their time), while she doesn't get the benefit of him not playing beforehand. However, she was okay with the original plan of not having sex and doing other things. His frustration is about feeling coerced to give up some of his time to get intimacy. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs without manipulation. If she used sex as a condition for his activities, even if she called it an offer, it could be a power play. The author's reaction, while aggressive, is about setting boundaries against manipulation. However, his approach was confrontational (\"WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head\") which might have escalated things. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss feelings calmly. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong in feeling manipulated, but his response could have been more constructive. The girlfriend's offer might have been a way to express her needs, but it's possible she didn't realize the power dynamic involved. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because he's standing up for himself against what he perceives as manipulation, even if the communication could have been better. The key is mutual understanding and respect, and if she was using sex as leverage, then the author is right to object. However, if she didn't intend it that way, maybe he overreacted. But given the scenario, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries against what he sees as a power play.\n"
