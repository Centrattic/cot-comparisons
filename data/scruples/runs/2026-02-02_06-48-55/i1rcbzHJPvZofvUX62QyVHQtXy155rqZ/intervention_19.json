She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple trying to make plans for the night. The girlfriend initially doesn't want to have sex and wants to just chill. The author is okay with that. Then they discuss activities, and when the author suggests video games, the girlfriend offers that they can have sex if he doesn't play games at all today. The author feels like she's using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thinks the girlfriend is trying to control him by linking their sexual activity to his choice to play games. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as an offer or a compromise. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the girlfriend made an offer that the author didn't agree with. The author might feel that the offer is one-sided, where he's giving up his time playing games without any benefit, while she gets to have sex. That could be seen as a power imbalance. However, the girlfriend might argue that she's trying to find a way to have both intimacy and a different activity together. \n\nBut here's the thing: in healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are met without using incentives or punishments. If one partner is using something they value (like sex) as a condition for another activity, it can come off as manipulative. The key point is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip. The author's frustration is about feeling that his autonomy is being compromised. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt that the only way to have physical intimacy is if the author gives up an activity he wants to do. But the author's suggestion was to play games before she arrives, which would not interfere with their time together. The girlfriend's refusal to accept that compromise might be where the issue lies. \n\nThe author's reaction of calling it a \"power play\" is a strong statement, but if the girlfriend's intention was just to make an offer and not to manipulate, then the author might be overreacting. However, if the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional reward, that can create an unhealthy dynamic. \n\nIt's also important to consider mutual respect and consent. The author is within his right to decline the offer, and the girlfriend is also within her right to make that offer. The problem arises if one party is pressuring the other into a compromise that feels unfair. \n\nIn this case, the author might be in the right to express his discomfort with the power dynamic, but he could have handled it more calmly. The girlfriend, by making the offer, might not be in the wrong, but she could have communicated her needs differently. However, if the offer was meant to be a non-negotiable condition, that's where the issue starts. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's perspective that the girlfriend is using sex as a power play could be valid. But the girlfriend might genuinely see it as a way to balance their time. The answer might depend on the underlying intentions and past patterns in their relationship. But based on the information given, the author's reaction seems reasonable, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
