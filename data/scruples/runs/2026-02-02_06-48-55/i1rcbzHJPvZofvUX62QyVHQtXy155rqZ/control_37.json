She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a disagreement between him and his girlfriend about having sex versus playing video games. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked to not have sex that night so they could just hang out, and he agreed. Then they started planning their evening. He suggested playing video games, which she wanted to do something together instead. He clarified he wanted to play because he hadn't in a while. Then she offered that if he didn't play any games at all that day, they could have sex. He agreed but thought he could play before she arrived. She insisted it had to be no games at all on the day, and he got upset, calling it a power play. She says it was just an offer, and now they're not speaking.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is upset because he feels his girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his activities. She, on the other hand, might see it as a playful negotiation between them. But does that make her wrong? Well, using sex as a condition for another activity could be seen as a power move if one party feels pressured. The author argues that the offer doesn't benefit her, implying it's a way to control him. However, if both are okay with such negotiations, it's their prerogative. But the author's reaction was frustration and calling it \"fucked up,\" which might be valid if he felt uncomfortable. However, the issue is whether he overreacted. \n\nThe girlfriend initiated the offer, and he had the choice to accept or not. He did accept the first part (not during their time together) but then she changed the terms to no games at all. He felt it was unfair and called it out. Whether he's wrong depends on if he should have respected her boundary, even if he found it a power play. But if she's using sex to get him to change his plans, maybe he's right to be concerned about manipulation. However, if it's a mutual decision without pressure, maybe not. The line here is thin. But since he felt it was a power play and she called it a difference of opinion, the problem is communication. The author might be in the right for standing up for himself, but maybe he could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the context, I think the answer is B (No), because he's expressing his feelings about the situation and setting boundaries, which is valid. However, this is a tricky one. But considering that she made the initial offer and he was trying to negotiate, his reaction might be justified. So B.\n"
