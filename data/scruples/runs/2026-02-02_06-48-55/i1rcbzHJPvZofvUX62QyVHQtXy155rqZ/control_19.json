She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a couple discussing plans for the evening, specifically around having sex and playing video games. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The girlfriend initially asks not to have sex that night because they do it often. The author agrees. Then they plan dinner and activities. The author suggests playing video games, the girlfriend wants to do something together. The author says they want to play games because they haven't in a while. Then the girlfriend says if he doesn't play games during their time together, they can have sex. The author agrees but suggests playing before she arrives. She then changes the offer to not playing games at all that day, leading to no sex if he plays any. The author gets upset, calling it a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's viewpoint: They feel the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional exchange. By linking sex to not playing games (even before their time together), the author sees it as a power play. They argue that since the games are before their time together, it shouldn't affect the evening's plans. They feel it's unfair to have sex contingent on their activities, even if it's an \"offer\" that can be declined. The author's main issue is the use of sex as a bargaining chip to control their behavior.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She's making an offer to have sex if he forgoes playing games all day. She doesn't see it as a power play but a mutual agreement. She might feel that she's being fair by providing an alternative (no sex) if he plays. She might think that the author is being overly sensitive, as she didn't intend to coerce but simply to make a choice. She might see it as a way to balance their activities, ensuring they have a varied evening.\n\nNow, considering healthy relationships, mutual respect, and communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using conditions that pressure the other. Using sex as a conditional exchange can be problematic because it may imply that one partner's desire is contingent on the other's compliance, which can create power imbalances.\n\nThe girlfriend's offer might be seen as a way to balance their activities. However, if the author feels that the condition is unfair, especially when the activity (gaming) is not during their time together, there's a valid concern. The author is right to feel that their autonomy in personal time (before she arrives) is being restricted for a sexual condition. If the condition is that they can't play games at all that day (including before), it's a broader restriction than necessary, which could be perceived as a power play.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not see it as a power play but as a way to have a balanced evening. However, the fact that she later changed the terms (from before she arrives to all day) might have escalated the situation. The author is justified in feeling that the condition is being used to control his behavior, even if she didn't intend it that way.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Both have valid points. However, if one partner consistently uses conditions that pressure the other into compliance for their own benefit, that's a red flag. The author's discomfort is valid because healthy relationships should avoid using such conditional exchanges. The girlfriend's approach might not be malicious, but it's still a form of manipulation if it's making the other person feel coerced.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps not intended as a power play, could be seen as using sex to control behavior, which is problematic. The author is right to express their discomfort and set boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
