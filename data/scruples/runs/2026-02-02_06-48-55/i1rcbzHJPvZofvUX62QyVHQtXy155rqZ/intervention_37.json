She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend about having sex versus playing video games.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's girlfriend initially asked not to have sex that night, which the author agreed to. Then, when the author suggested playing video games, the girlfriend offered to have sex if he didn't play games at all that day, including before she arrived. The author felt this was using sex as a power play, so they got upset. The girlfriend argues it was just an offer with no harm in declining.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and consent. The author thinks the girlfriend is manipulating by linking sex to not playing games. The girlfriend sees it as an option, not a demand. The author's main issue is that the condition (not playing games before they meet) doesn't benefit the girlfriend, making it a power move. The girlfriend doesn't see it that way, leading to a stalemate.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, both need to communicate needs clearly. The author's frustration is valid if they feel pressured. However, the girlfriend's request to not play games during their time together might be about wanting to be fully present. But when she ties not playing games (even before) to having sex, it could be seen as conditional, which the author finds manipulative.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel their needs are respected. The author's reaction might be overreacting, but the issue of using sex as a condition for something else is a red flag. However, if the girlfriend's offer was mutual and she didn't coerce, maybe the author is being too rigid.\n\nBut the author's main point is that the condition isn't fair because the only benefit is to them. If the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to influence the author's behavior, that's a problem. However, if she's just offering an alternative plan without pressure, then the author's response might be disproportionate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for labeling it as a power play. If the girlfriend truly meant it as an offer without manipulation, then the author's accusation could be invalid. But if the girlfriend's intention was to use sex as leverage, then the author is right to push back. Since the girlfriend denies it's a power play, the author might be misreading her intentions. Alternatively, her offer could indeed be manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, both have valid points, but the author's approach of calling it a power play might be harsh. However, the girlfriend's conditional offer could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's intent was manipulative. Since she denies it, and the author's reaction led to no plans, it's a complex situation. But given the information, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the conflict instead of discussing it calmly.\n"
