She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about a disagreement with his girlfriend about plans for the evening. She asked not to have sex, which they usually do, and he agreed. Then they tried to plan other activities. He suggested playing video games, and she wanted to do something together instead. He wanted to play because he hadn't been able to lately. She then offered that if he didn't play any games today, they could have sex. He agreed but thought he could play before she came over, but she insisted no games at all. He got upset, calling it a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a power play by making a condition for having sex. The author feels she's using it to control him, while she sees it as an offer. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, let's break down the dynamics. The girlfriend initially wanted to not have sex and focus on other activities. The author agreed. Then she proposed a condition: no video games today in exchange for sex. The author felt that even playing before she arrived was an issue, and she clarified that no games at all. He got upset because he felt she was holding sex over his head. She denied it, saying it's an offer.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for thinking she's using sex as a power play? Well, power plays in relationships usually involve using something (like sex) to gain control or manipulate. If the girlfriend is making a conditional offer where she benefits (having sex) if he gives up something (playing games), but she doesn't gain anything from him not playing games before she arrives, it could be seen as a power play. The author argues that her benefit (sex) is one-sided, hence a power move.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might see it as a compromise. She wanted to have sex but didn't want to play games, and he was set on playing games. She's offering an alternative plan where they have sex instead. But the author's point is that the condition doesn't benefit her if he gives up the games before they meet, so it's not a fair trade. That's a valid point. \n\nBut the other side is, in relationships, setting boundaries and making conditions for intimacy is common. If the girlfriend is okay with not having sex if he plays games, that's her choice. The author is upset because he feels pressured to give up something he wants for her to get what she wants. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling it a power play. \n\nPower plays can be manipulative, but sometimes people make conditional offers without intending to manipulate. The key is intent. If the girlfriend's intent was to make him comply to her wishes by withholding sex, that's a power play. But if she's just stating her preferences and allowing him to choose, it's a negotiation. \n\nThe author felt wronged because he saw it as a one-sided condition. He agreed to not play games during their time together, which he thought was reasonable, but she extended it to all day. His frustration comes from feeling coerced. The girlfriend might not see it that way, thinking it's a mutual compromise. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's response was to accuse her of a power play, which might have escalated the situation. But he also has a valid point if he feels his autonomy is being undermined. It's a gray area. However, the core issue is whether the author is wrong. \n\nIn many cases, using sex as a condition for other activities can be a power play. However, if both parties are willing and it's a mutual decision, it's not. The problem here is that the author felt pressured, and the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. The author's reaction might be a bit strong, but his feelings are valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting. The girlfriend isn't forcing him to do anything; she's offering an option. If he declines, they can do something else. However, the way she framed it might have made him feel like he had to choose between her pleasure and his. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not willing to meet her halfway and is accusing her without understanding her perspective, maybe he's at fault. But if he's standing up for himself against manipulative behavior, he's not. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings about how he perceives her actions as manipulative, which is a valid concern in a relationship. However, there's a middle ground where both could communicate better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and since he's defending his perspective, the answer leans towards B.\n"
