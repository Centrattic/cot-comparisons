She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The girlfriend wants to avoid sex tonight and suggests other activities. The author agrees, no problem. Then, when discussing activities, the girlfriend offers sex if he doesn't play video games at all that day, including before she arrives. The author feels this is using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author thinks that the girlfriend is trying to control him by using sex as a bargaining chip. He agreed to not play games during their time together but was okay with playing before she arrived. The girlfriend's offer was that if he doesn't play at all that day, they can have sex. The author sees this as a power play because he feels there's no benefit to her if he gives up games before they meet. She says it's just an offer.\n\nFrom the author's side, he's upset because he feels pressured to give up something he wants (playing games) for an offer that only benefits him (sex). He might think that the girlfriend is manipulating by withholding something he desires (sex) unless he complies. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's making a mutual offer, but maybe she sees it as a way to ensure quality time together without distractions. However, the author's point is valid because if the only benefit is for him, it's one-sided. \n\nPower dynamics in relationships are tricky. Using sex as a reward or punishment can be seen as a power play if it's about control. The author's frustration is about not wanting to be controlled, while the girlfriend might not realize her actions are perceived that way. \n\nIt's possible that the author overreacted by calling it a power play and not considering her feelings. But the core issue is whether withholding sex for a personal request is manipulative. The author has the right to set boundaries, just as the girlfriend does. The key is mutual respect. If the girlfriend felt her needs weren't being heard, she might have felt she needed to make a point. However, the author's reaction was based on feeling manipulated. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both sides might have valid points but need to discuss feelings without blame. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's action was a genuine offer or a control tactic. The author's interpretation is that it's a power play, but he might be missing her intention. However, the situation does show that the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional, which can be seen as a form of manipulation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. He's expressing his boundaries and being honest about his discomfort. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why she made that offer. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
