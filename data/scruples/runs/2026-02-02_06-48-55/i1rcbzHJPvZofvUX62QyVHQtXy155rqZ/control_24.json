She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author's girlfriend asked not to have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to just chill. He agreed and they started planning other activities. Then he suggested playing video games, which she didn't like because she wanted something together. He wanted to play, so she offered to have sex if he didn't play games at all. He was okay with that but clarified he could play before she arrived. She said no, it had to be no games all day. Then when she said they don't need to have sex, he got upset and accused her of using sex as a power play.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about mutual respect and how each party is viewing the negotiation. The author feels that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to get him to not play games before their time together. The girlfriend sees it as an offer, and the author's refusal to comply with her terms (no games all day) leads to no plans. \n\nFirst, the author agreed to not have sex that night initially, then the girlfriend offered to have sex if he gives up video games entirely. The author is okay to give up games during their time together but not before. The girlfriend's condition seems to be a non-negotiable for her. \n\nThe author is upset because he feels that the only benefit for her is having sex if he gives up something (games) that she doesn't value. He argues that since she's not getting a benefit from his giving up games before they meet, it's a power play. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as a compromise she's making by allowing sex if he gives up games.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a relationship, both parties should have the autonomy to set boundaries and make requests. If the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional offer, that's a form of emotional manipulation, right? Because it's using intimacy as a reward or punishment. The author is right to be upset if he feels pressured to give up something personal just to have sex. On the flip side, maybe the author is being too rigid. If the girlfriend's main issue is that they have sex too often and she wants to focus on other activities, then maybe the author could have compromised more.\n\nBut the key is the girlfriend's approach. If she's making the offer conditional on giving up games all day, even the time before they meet, that could be seen as using sex as leverage. The author's point is that there's no benefit to her if he gives up games before they meet, so it's not a fair trade. That does sound like a power play where she's trying to control his actions beyond their time together. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable because it's about mutual respect. If one partner uses intimacy as a bargaining chip, that can be a red flag. However, the author also might be overreacting. Maybe the girlfriend was just trying to find a middle ground, and the author's refusal to meet her condition (no games all day) led to no plans. It's a communication breakdown. The author might be in the right to set boundaries if he feels uncomfortable with the conditions, but maybe he could have approached the negotiation differently. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might be trying to express her needs in a way that's not entirely healthy. The author's accusation of a power play is valid if she's trying to control his behavior for her own benefit. So, based on this, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because using sex as a conditional offer for a non-beneficial action can be seen as a power play, and the author is justified in his feelings.\n"
