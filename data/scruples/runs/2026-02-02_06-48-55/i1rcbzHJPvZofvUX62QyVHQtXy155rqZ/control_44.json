She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a disagreement between a couple regarding sex and video games. \n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend were planning a night together. She asked to not have sex that night because they do it often, and he agreed. Then, when they were discussing activities, she offered that if he didn't play video games at all that day, they could have sex. He was okay with playing before she arrived but not during their time together. She clarified that even before she arrived, he couldn't play. Then he got upset, thinking she's using sex as a power play.\n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement and power dynamics. The author felt that the offer to have sex in exchange for not playing games (even before they met) was a power play because it didn't benefit her. She, however, sees it as an offer. \n\nPower dynamics in relationships can be tricky. Using something like sex as a condition for another activity might be seen as a power play if it's about control rather than mutual enjoyment. However, if both parties are okay with making such trades, it's a personal choice. The author's frustration comes from feeling that the terms are unfair or one-sided. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's making an offer, and he's free to decline. But if the offer is conditional on something that doesn't benefit her (not playing games before she arrives), then it's more about controlling his behavior for her benefit. The author's point is valid here because the trade isn't balanced. \n\nHowever, whether it's wrong depends on mutual consent and understanding. If they had prior discussions about such conditions, maybe it's okay. But in this case, the author felt it was a manipulation tactic, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend not acknowledging his perspective might indicate a communication issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his boundaries regarding his own activities, and recognizing when a partner's conditions might be a power play is a healthy part of a relationship. The problem might stem from differing views on how to negotiate such terms. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
