She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The girlfriend initially declines sex and wants to spend time doing other things. The author is okay with that. Then, when discussing activities, the author suggests playing video games. The girlfriend then offers that they can have sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, including before she arrives. The author feels this is using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thinks the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which he finds manipulative. He agreed not to play during their time together but thought playing beforehand was fine. The girlfriend sees her offer as a mutual choice, not a power play. She might feel that she's compromising by offering an alternative that benefits both (no games during their time = sex), and she's okay with not having sex if he chooses games. \n\nThe key here is whether using sex as a condition for an activity constitutes a power play. The author feels it's one-sided because the benefit (sex) is for him, while the cost (not playing games) is on him. The girlfriend might argue it's a fair trade for her preference. However, consent and mutual respect are crucial. If one person feels pressured or that the other is using intimacy to control, it can be problematic. The author's frustration is valid if he doesn't feel the offer is balanced. But the girlfriend might not see it that way, just a difference in how they value their time.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction might be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings. He labels her actions as \"fucked up\" and \"power play,\" which could escalate the conflict. Communication breakdown often happens when partners don't see eye to eye on compromise. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy in deciding when to engage in sex is being criticized. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both parties feel comfortable expressing their needs without feeling manipulated. If the girlfriend's intention was to set boundaries for her own comfort, and she's okay with the alternative, maybe it's not a power play. But if the author feels coerced or that the offer is unfair, he has a right to express that. The issue is whether the offer was intended to control or if it's a mutual compromise.\n\nThe line between healthy negotiation and manipulation can be blurry. Power dynamics in relationships often depend on context. If this is a recurring issue, it might indicate deeper problems. In this one instance, the girlfriend offered a choice, and the author rejected it. Whether that's wrong depends on their communication styles and past interactions. The author might be right to voice his discomfort, but his confrontational response might have hurt the relationship more.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether using sex as a conditional offer is manipulative. The author believes it is, and the girlfriend doesn't. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively. However, in healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are respected without using intimacy as leverage. The author's perspective might be valid if he feels manipulated, but his approach to addressing it could have been more constructive. The girlfriend's offer, while a conditional trade, might not be inherently wrong if it's a mutual decision. Therefore, the answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, as he's standing up for his boundaries, even if his delivery was harsh.\n"
