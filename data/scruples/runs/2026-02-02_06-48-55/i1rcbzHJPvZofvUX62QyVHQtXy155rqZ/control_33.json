She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking his girlfriend is using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend are trying to plan a night together. She wants to not have sex that night and suggests other activities. He agrees. Then when discussing games, she offers sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, not just during their time together. He feels it's unfair to have to give up gaming time before she arrives to get sex later. He calls it a power play, and they end up not talking.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend is setting a boundary, not wanting sex that night. The author is okay with that. But then she offers a trade: if he doesn't game at all that day, they can have sex. The author feels this is manipulative because he's giving up something (gaming before she arrives) with no benefit to her except the possibility of sex. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, using sex as a bargaining chip can be problematic. The girlfriend is setting a condition where the author must sacrifice his own time (gaming) to get something he wants (sex). Even though he says it's okay to play before she arrives, she's still making the sex contingent on his compliance. The author's frustration is valid because it's a form of conditional intimacy, which can be seen as a power dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue it's just a suggestion. But the power play aspect comes from the fact that she's using the absence of sex as a way to influence his behavior. The author is right to feel that his needs (to game) are being ignored for her to get her way. So the author isn't in the wrong here. He's highlighting a boundary issue where mutual respect is lacking. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
