She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend discussing their plans for the evening. The girlfriend initially wants to skip sex and do something else, which the author agrees to. Then she offers to have sex if he gives up playing games entirely that day\u2014before she arrives and during their time together. He feels this is using sex as a power play, while she sees it as an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main argument is that the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional reward to make him give up something he wants (video games). He feels that giving up games before she arrives shouldn't affect their evening, so her condition is unfair. On the other hand, the girlfriend might view her offer as a fair trade: she gives up sex (which she wanted to avoid) if he gives up games (which he wanted to play during their time together). She sees it as an offer, not a power play.\n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend is using a sexual relationship as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. The author believes he's being manipulated, while she sees it as mutual agreement. However, when he refuses her condition, she's okay with just spending time otherwise, which he sees as a withdrawal of the offer. The author feels disrespected because he thinks she's trying to leverage his desires against his actions. \n\nBut consent is mutual in relationships. If she's offering and he can accept or decline without pressure, then technically she's not coercing. However, the issue arises when one partner uses the possibility of a sexual act to influence the other's behavior. This can be seen as a form of power play, especially if one partner feels they have to comply to gain the desired outcome. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he feels his autonomy is being compromised. However, the girlfriend might believe that mutual compromises are necessary in a relationship. The problem is whether the compromise is healthy. Using sex as a conditional reward might not be inherently wrong, but it can feel transactional. The author's perception that it's a power play stems from his discomfort with the conditions attached. \n\nIn many relationships, negotiating compromises is normal, but when one partner feels they're being controlled or manipulated, it's a red flag. The girlfriend's response, not seeing it as a power play but as an offer, suggests a miscommunication. The author's reaction, calling it a power play and saying it's \"fucked up,\" might be an overreaction if she's not forcing him, but if he genuinely feels disrespected, that's a valid emotion. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. He's standing up for his boundaries. However, his approach could be seen as dismissive of her offer. The root issue is their differing views on how to negotiate their time and intimacy. Neither is completely right or wrong, but the author's accusation of a power play might be a misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to be careful with the nuances.\n"
