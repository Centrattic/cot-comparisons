She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about whether the guy can play video games before his girlfriend arrives, in exchange for having sex. \n\nFirst, the author says he's upset because his girlfriend is using sex as a power play. He agreed not to play games during their evening but she wanted him to not play at all that day. He felt that her offer was conditional on him giving up something (pre-game play) for her benefit (sex), making it a power play. She sees it as just an offer.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's arguing that his personal choice to play games before they meet shouldn't be a condition for having sex. He feels it's unfair that she's using sex as a bargaining chip. On the other hand, his girlfriend might feel that she's trying to balance their time together without constant sex, and she's made a compromise by offering sex in return for him not playing games during their time together. \n\nThe key here is whether conditioning sex on giving up an activity before the time together is a power play. The author's main point is that the condition is arbitrary and only benefits her. But maybe his girlfriend sees it as a fair trade for their time together. \n\nHowever, using the withholding of sex as a condition to get someone to comply with a personal request can be seen as manipulative. The author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to give up something trivial for her benefit. But it's also about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend's intention was to create a balanced evening without sexual pressure, maybe her approach came off as controlling. \n\nThe author's reaction might be overly harsh, but his underlying concern about fairness is justified. The girlfriend's offer could be misinterpreted as using sex as leverage. The problem might stem from a mismatch in expectations about how to spend time together. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the dynamics of power plays in relationships, the author might be correct in feeling that his girlfriend's condition was manipulative. However, if she genuinely saw it as an offer without coercion, then he might be misreading her intent. \n\nBut the fact that he's so upset about it and she's not seeing his perspective suggests there's a communication breakdown. Maybe the author is in the wrong if he's framing the issue as a power play when she didn't intend it that way. Alternatively, if she's actually using sex as a conditional, he's right to push back. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the condition was intended as a power play. If she genuinely saw it as a mutual exchange and he's perceiving it as such, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. But if she's using sex to control his actions, then he's justified. \n\nLooking at the details, the author tried to clarify that playing before she arrives isn't during their time together, but she insisted. The fact that she offered to not have sex if he plays suggests she's using it as a condition for her own satisfaction, which can be seen as a power play. Therefore, the author is not wrong to express his discomfort with that dynamic.\n"
