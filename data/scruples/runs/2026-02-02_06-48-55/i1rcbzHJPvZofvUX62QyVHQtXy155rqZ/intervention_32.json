She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between a guy and his girlfriend. He wanted to plan a night where they might have sex, but she asked not to have sex because they do it often and she just wants to chill. He agreed, and then later when he suggested playing video games, she offered that they can have sex if he doesn't play any games.\n\nThe author is upset because he feels like she's using sex as a power play. He thinks it's unfair that she's trying to control the situation by making him choose between not playing games and having sex. He argues that not playing games before she arrives shouldn't affect her, so it's not a fair trade, hence a power play.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that she's just making a compromise. She wanted to spend quality time together, maybe not just having sex every time. Her offer could come from a place of wanting to balance their activities. When he agrees to not play during the evening, she might feel like she's given up her desire for intimacy in exchange for him not gaming during their time together. But then he pushes back because she also wants him not to play before she arrives, which he sees as controlling.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author's issue is that he feels pressured into a trade where the benefits aren't balanced. The girlfriend might see it as a way to have some time together without distractions. But the author's reaction of calling it a power play and being upset could come from feeling that his autonomy is being controlled. However, the girlfriend did offer an alternative (no sex, just other activities) and allowed him to decline. \n\nIt's possible that both have valid points. The author might be overreacting by framing it as a power play when she presented it as an offer. On the other hand, her making the condition about not playing games before she comes over might be seen as unnecessary control. The problem might stem from differing expectations and how they communicated their needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. But if we had to pick, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings about balancing their time together. However, his reaction is also about mutual respect and not feeling pressured. It's a tough call. The fact that she allowed him to decline suggests she wasn't forcing anything. The author might have misread her intentions as manipulative when she was just trying to find a middle ground. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he dismissed her offer as a power play without fully understanding her perspective. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if her conditions are unreasonable, then B (not in the wrong). But given the context, I think A might be the answer here because he's not considering her desire to have a non-sexual evening and is instead focusing on his own autonomy without compromise.\n"
