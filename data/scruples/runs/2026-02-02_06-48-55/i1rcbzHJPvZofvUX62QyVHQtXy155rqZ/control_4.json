She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is in a relationship with his girlfriend. He was trying to plan a night where they would hang out. She asked if they could skip sex that night because they do it often and she wants to do other things. He agreed, thinking it's fine. Then they discussed activities, like cooking and gaming. He suggested playing video games, but she wanted to do something together. He wanted to game because he hasn't had time due to midterms. She then offered that if he didn't play games at all today, they could have sex that night. He agreed but thought he could play before she came over. She clarified that he couldn't play any time today, not just before she arrived. When he refused, she said they don't need to have sex and would just do something else. He got upset, called it a power play, and they aren't talking now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The user feels that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining tool. He agreed not to play games during their time together but thought playing before was okay. She wanted him to give up gaming entirely for the day to get sex. He sees this as manipulative because he's giving up something (gaming) with no benefit to her, making it a power move. She argues it's an offer where both sides get something (he gives up gaming, they have sex). She says it's a difference of opinion.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, using sex as a condition for an activity might be a power play if one person is using it to control the other. The key is whether there's mutual benefit. The user argues that the offer only benefits him (he gets to have sex), not her. She might see the benefit as spending time together without gaming, but the user's compromise was already to not play during their time together. The girlfriend's request to not play at all (including before she arrives) seems to escalate the situation. The user's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to give up something for no reciprocal benefit. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's making a choice between activities. But in practice, making sex conditional on not doing another activity could be seen as a power play if it's used to control the other person's behavior. The user's reaction is about feeling manipulated, which is a red flag in relationships. The question is whether his assessment is correct. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't wrong for feeling that way. Using sex as a condition for another activity can be problematic if it's not mutual. The girlfriend's approach might be self-centered, making the user's feelings valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
