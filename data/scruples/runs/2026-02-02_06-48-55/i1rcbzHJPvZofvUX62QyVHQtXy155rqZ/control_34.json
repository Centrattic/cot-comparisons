She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between them and their girlfriend regarding sex and video games.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked to not have sex that night so they could just hang out. The author agreed and suggested playing video games. The girlfriend then offers sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, including before she arrives. The author feels this is a power play because she's using sex as a bargaining chip for not playing games before they meet up. He gets upset and calls it holding sex over his head. She says it's just an offer and they can do something else if he declines. Now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are whether using sex as a condition for not playing games (even before the meeting) is a power play. The author thinks it's unfair because the benefit for her isn't there if he gives up games beforehand. The girlfriend sees it as an offer.\n\nPower play usually means someone is using their position or influence to control another person. If she's using the threat of withholding sex to get him to comply with her terms, that could be seen as a manipulation tactic. However, if it's presented as an offer where he can accept or decline without pressure, maybe it's not. \n\nThe author's point is that there's no benefit to her if he gives up games before they meet. So she's not getting anything except maybe his compliance, which he can choose to refuse. That seems like a power play because the benefit (sex) is only one-sided. If she's not getting anything else from him not playing games, then her condition is just to see if he'll comply, which could be about control rather than mutual benefit.\n\nBut then, maybe the girlfriend's intention wasn't to control but to negotiate. She might have felt that if they don't play games during their time together, they can have sex. However, when the author suggested playing before she arrives, she extended the condition to all day. The author felt that's unreasonable because it's before their time together, so it shouldn't matter. The girlfriend might not see it as a power play because she's offering an option, not forcing him.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and holding sex over his head might have been harsh. If she didn't see it as a power play, maybe there's a miscommunication. However, the author's perspective is that the offer isn't balanced, so he's standing his ground. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are respected. If one person is using a specific aspect (like sex) to influence another's behavior without mutual benefit, that could be problematic. The author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to give up something (games) for her benefit (sex) without reciprocal benefit. However, if the girlfriend genuinely saw it as an offer and not a manipulation tactic, then maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut given the context, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his boundaries about not being controlled through such tactics. She should respect his perspective. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
