She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to get a clear picture.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They were trying to plan their evening. She wanted to not have sex tonight because they do it often and she wants to just hang out. He agreed and suggested playing video games. She then offered that if he didn't play games at all that day, they could have sex. He initially thought he could play before she arrived, but she clarified it had to be no games all day. He got upset, called it a power play, and now they're not speaking.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key issue is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a power play. The author thinks she is, by making the condition that if he doesn't play games all day, they can have sex. She sees it as an offer, and he sees it as a manipulation.\n\nFirst, from the author's perspective, he's frustrated that she's making a trade: no games in exchange for sex. He feels that the only benefit to her is maybe not having to do something else, but he doesn't see how not playing games before they meet benefits her. He's arguing that it's a power play because she's using sex as a bargaining chip to get him to comply with her terms.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she's making an offer. She wanted to have sex tonight, and the condition was not playing games during their time together. Then she extended it to not playing any games that day. She might be trying to spend more focused time with him without distractions, and sees the offer as a way to have both activities (sex and games) or just the alternative. She doesn't see it as a power play, just a mutual decision.\n\nNow, the concept of a power play in relationships usually refers to using something (like sex) to control or manipulate the other person. If she's making sex conditional on him giving up something he wants (video games), that could be seen as using power dynamics. However, if it's framed as a mutual offer where both parties can agree or decline, it's more about negotiation.\n\nBut the author is upset because he feels the condition is unfair. He agreed not to play during their time together, but he thought playing earlier was okay. She changed the terms to no games all day, which he perceives as a way to control him. He's not happy with the ultimatum and feels manipulated.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's a difference in perspective. She doesn't see it as a power play, just an offer. She's also willing to go without sex if he declines the offer. That seems fair in a way, as it's her choice too.\n\nBut the author's main point is that the offer doesn't benefit her, so it's a one-sided power play. If the only benefit is for him (getting to have sex) and she's only giving up something (no games), then it's more of a trade where she's using sex as a reward. However, if he's not okay with the terms, he can refuse. Is that manipulation or just a mutual negotiation?\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable with their boundaries. If she's using sex to control his behavior, that's a red flag. But if it's a mutual decision and he's not forced into anything, it's more of a negotiation. However, the key here is that the author felt pressured and called it a power play. If he's not comfortable with the conditions, then it's his right to say no. The girlfriend is within her rights to set her own conditions for intimacy, but if it's making the other person uncomfortable to the point of conflict, there might be communication issues.\n\nThe author's reaction might be a bit strong. He accused her of holding sex over his head, which could be seen as an accusation of manipulation. But if she's presenting it as an option and not a demand, then maybe he's overreacting. However, the change in terms from games during their time together to all day might have been the trigger for his frustration. He felt it was an ultimatum, which can feel like a power play.\n\nOn the other hand, she might not have intended it as a power play but just wanted to have sex that night, so she's setting conditions she's comfortable with. If he's not okay with those conditions, then it's a mutual decision not to proceed. The problem is their communication styles. The author might have assumed negative intent where she didn't mean it that way, or she might not be considering how her conditions are perceived.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong to set his own boundaries and express his discomfort with the terms. However, the girlfriend isn't entirely wrong either if she's just setting her own preferences. The conflict arises from differing perspectives on mutual negotiation versus power dynamics.\n\nBut according to the initial question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning isn't given, but maybe they believe the girlfriend was just making an offer and the author overreacted. Alternatively, maybe the user thinks the author is wrong because using sex as a condition for something else is inherently manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the girlfriend's actions are seen as a power play. If the author perceives it as such, but she doesn't, it's a communication issue. The author might not be in the wrong for standing up for his feelings, but he could have approached it differently. However, if the girlfriend's conditions are reasonable and the author is misinterpreting them, then he might be in the wrong for the accusation. Given the details, I think the author's perspective is valid in feeling manipulated, but the situation is complex. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering the typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
