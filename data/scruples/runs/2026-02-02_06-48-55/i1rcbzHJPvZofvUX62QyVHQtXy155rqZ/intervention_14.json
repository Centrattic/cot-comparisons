She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about whether he can play video games before they meet up, and the girlfriend offering to have sex if he doesn't play at all that day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wanted to play games before their evening together, and the girlfriend set a condition that if he plays at all that day, they can't have sex. The author feels this is using sex as a power play, while the girlfriend says it's just an offer and a difference of opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and mutual agreement. The author claims that the condition is a power play, meaning the girlfriend is trying to control him by withholding sex unless he complies. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see it as her expressing her needs and boundaries, using her own desires to negotiate a different activity that benefits both, like having more quality time together instead of just sex.\n\nThe author's initial reaction was to call the girlfriend's offer a power play, which could come off as accusatory. However, he did clarify his position and offered alternatives, so maybe he's trying to communicate his feelings. The girlfriend's side isn't fully detailed, but she might feel that she's not being prioritized or that her wishes for the evening aren't respected. She might also think that by setting this condition, she's being fair because she's willing to give up sex for non-gaming time, and he's choosing to accept the offer.\n\nBut using a power dynamic where one person uses a desired activity (sex) as a conditional exchange for another (not playing games) can be a form of manipulation. Even if it's framed as an offer, the implication is that the person has to give up something they want (games) to get something else (sex). This could be seen as holding sex over the other person's head, which is a power play. However, the girlfriend might not see it that way if she believes they can negotiate mutual benefits.\n\nThe author's argument is that the benefit isn't mutual because he doesn't gain anything from not playing games except the possibility of sex. The girlfriend might think that the benefit is the time spent doing something else together, which she values. But if the only benefit for the author is the potential for sex, and the girlfriend is using that to enforce her conditions, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author could have expressed his feelings more clearly, and the girlfriend might have needed to consider that the condition could be perceived as controlling. The fact that they aren't speaking now suggests a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for feeling that the condition is unfair or a power play, especially if he perceives it as being manipulated. However, the girlfriend's intention might be to set boundaries, which is her right. The issue is whether setting such a conditional expectation is appropriate. If the author feels coerced into a choice that benefits him only if he gets the desired outcome (sex), then the girlfriend's approach might be problematic. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that the girlfriend was simply expressing her preferences, and the author overreacted by accusing her of a power play. In that case, the author might be the one misinterpreting her offer as manipulative when she was just trying to negotiate. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer depends on whether the girlfriend's condition was meant to manipulate or simply to express her boundaries. If the offer was a genuine way to find a compromise, the author might be in the wrong for calling it a power play. If the girlfriend was using sex as a conditional reward, then maybe she's in the wrong. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and based on the information given, the author's argument is about the power dynamic. The girlfriend's response of \"difference of opinion\" might indicate that she doesn't see it as a power play, but if the author feels that way, there's a conflict. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because using sex as a conditional offer based on another person's behavior can be a form of manipulation. But it also depends on the context of their relationship and how they usually communicate. Without more info, it's hard to say, but the author's reaction is valid if he feels uncomfortable with that dynamic. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
