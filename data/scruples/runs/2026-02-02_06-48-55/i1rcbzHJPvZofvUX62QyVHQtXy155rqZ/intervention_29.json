She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who had a disagreement with his girlfriend over plans for the evening. He wanted to play video games, and she initially didn't want to have sex that night. He agreed to that. Then she offered sex if he didn't play games at all (including before she arrived), which he felt was using sex as a power play. He got upset and the conversation ended without resolution.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend wanted to spend time together without sex, which is reasonable since they already have sex often. She made an offer: if he gives up gaming entirely that day (even before she arrives), they can have sex. The author felt that this was unfair because the gaming time was before their hangout. He saw it as her using sex to control him, which he found manipulative. She, on the other hand, saw it as a mutual offer, not a power play.\n\nKey points: The author's main issue is that the condition for sex was him not gaming at all, even before she arrived. He felt it was a power play because she didn't gain anything from him not gaming beforehand. She might see it as a way to ensure they have quality time together without distractions. However, the author's response was to accuse her of manipulation, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the condition isn't mutually beneficial, hence a power play. But the girlfriend might have different priorities, like wanting undivided attention during their time together. However, the author's reaction of calling her manipulative and saying she's trying to bend him over might be too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's condition could be seen as linking intimacy to a sacrifice from him, which he didn't agree with. The author might be right in feeling that his autonomy is being challenged. But it's possible that he's overreacting by not considering her perspective. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings without accusing her, aiming for a compromise. However, the girlfriend's condition also might not have considered his need to relax by gaming before she arrives. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He might be partly responsible for not approaching the situation with more empathy. But the girlfriend's condition was also a form of using sex as a bargaining chip, which the author rightly found problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to weigh both sides. The author's accusation might be valid, but his tone could have been more constructive. Alternatively, the girlfriend's use of sex as a condition is manipulative. \n\nGiven that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's condition was a power play. But if the author's reaction was overly harsh, maybe he's partly at fault. But the main issue is the condition itself. The author's stance is about not wanting to be controlled, which is a valid concern. So I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
