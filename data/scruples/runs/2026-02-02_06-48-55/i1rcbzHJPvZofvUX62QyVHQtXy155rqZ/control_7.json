She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding sex and video games.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked not to have sex that night, which the author agreed to. Then, when discussing plans, the girlfriend offered sex if he didn't play video games at all that day, even before she arrived. The author felt this was using sex as a power play because the compromise was only about during their time together, not before. The author refused the offer, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author didn't want to sacrifice his gaming time before their meeting, which is his personal time. The girlfriend's condition seems to tie sex to his willingness to give up his activities, which the author sees as manipulative. \n\nUsing sex as a condition for another activity can be problematic if it's not a mutual agreement. The author's frustration is understandable because he felt pressured to give up something he valued (gaming) for sex, which he might not be comfortable with. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's making an offer, but if it's not a mutual benefit and instead a trade-off that favors one side, it can be seen as a power play. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel their needs are respected. The author's stance is about setting boundaries, which is valid. However, the way he reacted (\"WTF\" and calling it \"fucked up\") might have been confrontational. Still, the core issue is about mutual respect in their negotiations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because he's asserting his boundaries. The girlfriend's approach may be manipulative. So the answer should be B.\n"
