She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The girlfriend wants to avoid sex tonight to spend time doing other activities, but then offers sex in exchange for him not playing video games at all that day. The author feels this is a power play and refuses, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author thinks his girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip by linking it to him not playing games before their time together. He sees it as a power move where she's trying to control his behavior through the promise of sex. On the other hand, the girlfriend might view it as a mutual offer to adjust plans for the night. She might not see it as a power play but rather as a compromise where both parties get something they want: intimacy in exchange for his cooperation in not distracting himself with games.\n\nThe key point is whether the girlfriend's proposal is a power play. A power play typically involves manipulating someone to get one's way by making demands, possibly through threats or conditional offers. Here, the girlfriend is offering sex if he forgoes playing games. The author argues that not playing games before they meet (which is 2 hours prior) doesn't benefit her, so the offer is one-sided, making it a power play. However, the girlfriend might argue that the absence of games during their time together is what's important for her, so the offer is a genuine compromise.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured. Using sex as a condition for a non-related activity could be seen as manipulative. However, the girlfriend might not intend it that way and believes it's a fair exchange. The problem arises from differing perceptions of the situation. The author's reaction is based on his interpretation, while the girlfriend sees it as a simple offer.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no clear right or wrong here, but in terms of relationships, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. If the author truly believes the offer is conditional and not a genuine exchange, then his reaction might be justified. However, if the girlfriend genuinely wanted to spend quality time and offered intimacy as a choice, not a conditional, then the author's reaction might be overreacting.\n\nAnother angle: the author agreed to not play during their time together but was uncomfortable with extending that to the entire day. The girlfriend's insistence on the pre-visit gaming might have been a test of his willingness to comply, which the author perceived as controlling. The breakdown in communication led to the conflict. Both parties might have valid points, but the core issue is their differing views on the nature of the offer.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the girlfriend's intent. If she made the offer as a power play, he's justified. If she meant it as a genuine choice, his reaction might be excessive. However, given the information, the author's interpretation is plausible, so the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
