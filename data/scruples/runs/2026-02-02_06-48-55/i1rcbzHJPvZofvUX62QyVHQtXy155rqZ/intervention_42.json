She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the girlfriend is using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked not to have sex that night so they could spend time doing other things. The author agreed to that. Then when the author suggested playing video games, the girlfriend made a deal: if he doesn't play games at all (including before she arrives), they can have sex. He felt this was a power play because he thought playing before she came over wasn't an issue. He got upset, called her out on using sex as leverage, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but wants my opinion. Let me think about both sides. The author's perspective is that the girlfriend is manipulating by linking sex to his gaming, which he sees as unfair. The girlfriend's side is that she's just making an offer, not a power play, and he's overreacting. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should communicate their needs. The author felt disrespected because he thought the condition was unnecessary. The girlfriend wanted to have sex but might have been using it as a bargaining chip. However, the author's reaction was to call her out harshly (\"fucked up to use sex as a power play\"), which might have been too confrontational. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is wrong. The girlfriend wanted to have sex and linked it to him not gaming at all. The author was okay with not gaming during their time together but didn't want to give up gaming before. The girlfriend's condition was a bit extreme, maybe. But the author's response was to accuse her of manipulation, which might have been a misstep. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective and reacted angrily. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was indeed using sex to control his behavior, the author isn't wrong to feel that way. It's a bit of a gray area. The user said they think the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how one views relationship dynamics. \n\nIn many cases, using sex as leverage can be seen as a form of manipulation, which the author is pointing out. However, the author's own approach to the situation (calling her out harshly) might have been inappropriate. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, if the girlfriend was indeed using a power play, the author is justified. However, if the author misread the situation and the girlfriend was just trying to make a compromise, then he might be at fault. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend didn't see it as a power play and thought it was an offer, but the author saw it as manipulation, it's a difference in perspective. The author's main issue was feeling controlled, which is valid if that's how he felt. But maybe he should have communicated better instead of accusing her. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If using sex as a condition for not gaming is a power play, then the author isn't in the wrong for objecting. But if it's just a mutual negotiation, then he is overreacting. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because he expressed his feelings about the situation and felt it was a power play, which is a valid perspective. The girlfriend's approach might be problematic, so the author isn't wrong for standing his ground.\n"
