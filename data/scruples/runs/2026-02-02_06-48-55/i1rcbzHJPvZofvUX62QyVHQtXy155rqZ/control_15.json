She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and their girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The girlfriend asked to skip sex so they can have other activities, and the author agreed. Then when the author suggested video games, the girlfriend offered sex in exchange for not playing games at all that day.\n\nFirst, the author felt like the girlfriend was using sex as a power play. The girlfriend says it's just an offer, but the author sees it as manipulative because the only benefit for the author is having sex, while the girlfriend doesn't gain anything from the author not playing games before she arrives. The author gets upset and calls it holding sex over their head. The girlfriend doesn't see it that way, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend made a conditional offer where the benefit was one-sided. The author felt it was unfair and manipulative. But does that make the author right? Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe girlfriend might have felt that she was trying to negotiate a compromise. She wanted to have sex but also wanted to avoid it that night to spend time doing other things. When the author suggested games, she offered an alternative arrangement. The problem is that the offer required the author to give up something (playing games) for her benefit (having sex). That's where the author feels it's a power play, using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should feel their needs are respected. If one person uses something like sex as a condition for another activity, it can be seen as coercive or manipulative if it's not a mutual exchange. The author's frustration comes from feeling that their autonomy is being controlled. The girlfriend's perspective might be that she was trying to create a positive outcome for both, but perhaps she didn't consider the author's feelings about the condition.\n\nThe author's response of calling it \"fucked up\" and holding sex over their head is strong, but it's in response to feeling manipulated. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, explaining their feelings without attacking the girlfriend. On the other hand, the girlfriend's offer might not have been intended to manipulate, but the way it was presented could be seen as using sex as leverage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely wrong for feeling that way, especially if they felt pressured. But maybe the issue is more about communication and understanding each other's perspectives. The girlfriend might not have realized how the offer came across. The author could have handled the situation with more patience, but the girlfriend's approach could also be seen as a form of conditional affection, which can be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have valid concerns about manipulation. However, both could have communicated better. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the girlfriend's actions might not be malicious, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
