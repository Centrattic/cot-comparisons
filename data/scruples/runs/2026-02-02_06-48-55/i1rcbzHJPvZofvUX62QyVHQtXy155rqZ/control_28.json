She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Here's the scenario: the author's girlfriend asked not to have sex that night, and the author agreed. Then, when the author suggested playing video games, the girlfriend countered by saying they could have sex if he gives up his gaming. The author felt it was a power play and refused, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both perspectives. The girlfriend wanted to spend time together without sex, which the author initially agreed to. But when she offered sex in exchange for him not playing games at all (even before she arrived), the author felt she was using sex as leverage. The key point here is whether the girlfriend's offer was a fair compromise or a manipulation tactic.\n\nThe author argues that the condition (no games all day for sex) is a power play because it's a one-sided benefit for her. The girlfriend might see it as a way to have more quality time together, but the author feels it's unfair because he's giving up his gaming time, which he hasn't had much of due to midterms. The fact that the author agreed to not play during their evening time but not before raises a question about why the pre-visit gaming is an issue. The girlfriend's stance that she doesn't need the benefit of him not gaming before they meet might make it seem one-sided, hence a power play.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not see it that way; she could think that by not playing games all day, they can have more focused time together. However, the author's frustration comes from feeling like his personal time (before she arrives) is being controlled, which is valid. The fact that she didn't benefit from him not gaming before they met but was using the offer of sex as a bargaining chip could indeed be seen as a power play.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary here. Using sex as a condition for activities might be inappropriate if it's not mutual. Both need to communicate their needs better. The author's reaction is about maintaining his autonomy and not feeling coerced into sacrificing his personal time for her condition. The girlfriend's offer might not be malicious, but the author's interpretation is valid because it's a manipulation tactic where she uses the possibility of sex to influence his behavior, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
