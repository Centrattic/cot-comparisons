She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing their plans for the evening. The girlfriend initially asks not to have sex because they do it often and wants to just hang out. The author agrees and suggests playing video games. Then, the girlfriend offers that they can have sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, including before she arrives. The author gets upset, thinking she's using sex as a power play, and they end up not talking.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong to feel that way. The author thinks she's using sex as a bargaining chip, making him give up gaming time in exchange for sex. The girlfriend sees it as an offer, and the author refuses. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect. In a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable setting boundaries. The girlfriend's request to not play games during their time together might be her way of balancing their time. But when she ties having sex to him not playing games even before she arrives, that's where it gets complicated. The author feels it's a power play because giving up his gaming time doesn't benefit her, so she's using sex as a reward to control his behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might think she's being reasonable. If she wanted to have sex, she might see it as a way to negotiate their time together. But using sex as a condition for another activity could be seen as manipulative if it's about control rather than mutual agreement. The key is whether the request is about their shared time or using sex as leverage to control his actions outside of their planned time together.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to sacrifice personal time for her condition. However, the girlfriend's offer was optional, and he declined, which she respected. But the argument arises from differing perspectives on what constitutes fair negotiation. The author's reaction might be justified if he feels uncomfortable with the power dynamic, but the girlfriend might not see it that way. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries or feeling uncomfortable with the exchange. The girlfriend isn't wrong for making an offer, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings. However, since they both have different viewpoints and the situation is a matter of opinion, the answer might hinge on whether using sex as part of a trade is inherently a power play. Since the author's intention was to play games before she arrives, which she didn't specify, her adding that condition might be an overreach. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground.\n"
