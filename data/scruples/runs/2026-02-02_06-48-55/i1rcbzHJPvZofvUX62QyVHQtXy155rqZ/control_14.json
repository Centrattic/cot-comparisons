She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about an argument with his girlfriend about making plans for the evening. She wanted to not have sex that night and suggested they do other things. The author agreed. Then when discussing activities, he suggested playing video games, and she proposed a trade: if he doesn't play games at all that day, they can have sex. He felt this was using sex as a power play and refused, leading to a conflict where they aren't speaking now.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The girlfriend asked to skip sex and wanted to just hang out. The author agreed. Then he suggested games, which she wanted to do together. He insisted on solo games, she made a condition for sex if he forgoes all gaming that day. He felt this was manipulative, she didn't, and now they're not talking.\n\nIs the author wrong for thinking she's using sex as a power play? Well, power dynamics in relationships can be tricky. If she's linking sex to his activities, maybe he's right to feel it's a power move. But maybe she's just trying to negotiate. The key here is whether the offer is a fair exchange or if it's using sex as leverage. \n\nThe author argues that the condition (no games all day) only benefits her (getting sex) without a mutual benefit. She might see it as a way to spend more time together, but he feels it's controlling. If she's not forcing him, but offering an option, maybe he's overreacting. But if the offer is a way to pressure him into giving up his own time for her benefit, then he's justified in feeling it's a power play.\n\nThe author's main issue is the control aspect. He didn't want to give up all gaming time just to get sex. Healthy relationships shouldn't use sex as a reward or punishment. If she's using sex as a condition for his behavior, that could be problematic. However, communication is key. They might both have valid points but need to discuss boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. It's a matter of perspective. If she truly didn't see it as a power play, maybe there's a miscommunication. But his perspective is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if his response was too harsh, maybe A. But given the scenario, he's reacting to a perceived manipulation, so B seems more likely.\n"
