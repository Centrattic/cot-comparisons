She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's girlfriend not wanting to have sex and instead suggesting other activities. The author agreed, but when the girlfriend later offers sex in exchange for him not playing video games at all that day, the author gets upset and calls it a power play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend initially didn't want to have sex and wanted to spend time doing other things. The author was okay with that. Then, she proposed a deal: if he doesn't play games at all that day, they can have sex. The author was okay with that, but then got upset when she insisted on not playing games even before they met up.\n\nThe author's main point is that the girlfriend is using sex as a reward to control his actions, which he finds manipulative. He argues that the deal isn't beneficial for her except to get him to comply, hence a power play. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as a mutual offer. \n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships, both partners should have the right to set their needs. The girlfriend might feel that she wants to have sex but also doesn't want to play games, so making a trade. The author might feel that his own preferences (playing games before meeting her) are being unfairly restricted for her benefit. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did agree to the initial offer of not playing during their time together. But when she extended it to before their meeting, he felt it was overstepping. He called her out on it, leading to the argument. \n\nIt's tricky. Using sex as a condition for doing something could be seen as a power play, especially if one person is using it to influence the other's behavior. However, the author also made a choice to use the offer as leverage. The girlfriend might have felt she was just making a mutual agreement. \n\nBut the key here is that the author agreed to the original deal of not playing during their time. When the girlfriend extended the condition, he felt it was unfair. He expressed his frustration, which might have been harsh, but his reasoning was based on not wanting to feel controlled. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries. However, the way he reacted (\"WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head\") might have come off as confrontational. That said, his concern about it being a power play is valid if he feels pressured. The girlfriend's offer could be seen as using sex to get her way, which is a power dynamic. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend genuinely saw it as a mutual choice and not a manipulation, then the author's interpretation might be projecting his own discomfort. But given that the author felt it was a power play, and relationships require mutual respect, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries. However, there's a nuance here. The author did agree to part of the deal, but extended it. Maybe he should have communicated his discomfort earlier. But overall, using sex as a condition for other activities can be problematic and seen as a power play, especially if it's not a consistent pattern. So the author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, B.\n"
