She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking his girlfriend is using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend were trying to plan their evening. She wanted to not have sex that night and do other things. He agreed. Then they were discussing activities, and she proposed that if he didn't play video games at all that day (including before she arrived), they could have sex. He felt that this was a power play because she's using the threat of not having sex unless he gives up gaming. He called it out, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe author is arguing that the condition (no games today, even before she arrives) is unfair because the only benefit is for him to have sex, and she doesn't gain anything from him not gaming before they meet. She sees it as an offer, and he sees it as manipulation. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, thinking about power plays in relationships. A power play typically involves using something (like sex) to control or manipulate the other person into complying with one's wishes. In this case, the girlfriend is using the ability to have sex as a condition for him not playing games. But wait, he agreed to not play during their evening, but she wanted him to not play at all. The author felt that even giving up gaming before she arrives is a non-starter because the benefit is only one-sided (he wants to have sex, she gets nothing from him not gaming earlier). \n\nIs that a power play? Well, if she's using the threat of withholding sex to get him to give up something (gaming), even if it's not during their time together, it could be seen as manipulation. However, the girlfriend might argue that it's mutual\u2014she's offering an alternative activity (sex) in exchange for him not doing something else (gaming). But the key is whether the exchange is balanced. The author argues that the benefit is only for him, so it's not a fair trade. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend sees it as a way to have intimacy without the other distractions. She might think that if he's not playing games all day, he'll be more present for her. However, the author feels that the condition is unreasonable because the time before she arrives isn't their time together. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. If the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to influence his behavior, that's a power play. The author is justified in feeling that his autonomy is being compromised. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel she's expressing her needs and setting boundaries. \n\nBut the key is that the author feels manipulated. If she is using sex as a tool to control his actions, then he's right to call it out. However, if she's just expressing a preference and offering an option, maybe not. But the problem is that the offer is conditional on him giving up something (gaming before she arrives), which the author doesn't think is necessary. \n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his boundaries and rejecting manipulation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
