She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their argument with their girlfriend. The situation is about using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, let's understand the context. The author was planning to have sex every time they hang out, but the girlfriend wanted a different activity. The author agreed to that. Then, when suggesting video games, the girlfriend offers that if he doesn't play games at all (even before she arrives), they can have sex. The author feels this is a power play because the only benefit to the girlfriend is him not playing games before the meetup, which she doesn't gain anything from, but he gives up his fun. \n\nThe author argues that this is manipulative because the girlfriend is using sex as a reward for him giving up his time playing games. The girlfriend, on the other hand, says it was just an offer and a difference of opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and mutual benefit. In a healthy relationship, both parties should feel comfortable and not pressured. The girlfriend's offer could be seen as conditional, where she's using sex as a bargaining chip. The author feels that this is unfair because there's no mutual benefit for him except the potential for sex, which he's not getting if he refuses. \n\nBut is that actually the case? The girlfriend might be trying to balance their activities, wanting to spend time together without sex every time. However, by making it a conditional offer, it could indeed feel like a power move. The author is correct in pointing out that if there's no benefit for him to comply, then it's not a fair exchange. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to manipulate but rather to communicate her needs. The issue here is communication style. If she wanted to have sex but also wanted to avoid games, she might have approached it differently. \n\nThe author's reaction of calling it a power play might be valid because the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional reward. However, the author's own response was to accuse her of being manipulative, which could escalate the conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend made an offer and the author felt it was unfair, maybe the problem is mutual misunderstanding. The author's right to feel uncomfortable if they believe the girlfriend is using sex as a leverage. However, the girlfriend's offer might not have been intended that way. \n\nBut the core issue is whether using sex as a condition for an activity is a power play. In relationships, it's important that both parties can express their needs without using conditional terms that feel coercive. If the girlfriend is making sex conditional on the author giving up his own plans, even if before their time together, that could be seen as a power play. The author is right in feeling that his autonomy is being questioned. \n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's approach could be seen as manipulative, even if unintentionally. The author's response was to express his discomfort and set a boundary, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
