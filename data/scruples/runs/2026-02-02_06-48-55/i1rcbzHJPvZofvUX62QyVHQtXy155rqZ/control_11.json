She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario involves a couple making plans for the evening. The girlfriend initially asks not to have sex, which the guy agrees to. Then they plan activities, and when the guy suggests video games, the girlfriend offers sex in exchange for him not playing games at all that day. The guy feels like she's using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is about whether the girlfriend's offer is a power play. The guy thinks she's trying to control him by holding sex over his head. The girlfriend says it's just an offer with no pressure. They're now not speaking, and nothing's happening.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author (the guy) in the wrong? The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me think about both sides. From the guy's perspective, he agreed to not have sex that night, which he did. Then when he suggests playing games, she offers sex if he gives up gaming entirely for the day. He feels that's using sex as leverage to get him to comply with her wishes. He thinks the offer is one-sided because she benefits (sex) while he gives up something. \n\nFrom the girl's side, she's offering an option where he gives up gaming (which she might see as a distraction) to have intimacy. She might feel that he's being too focused on games and wants to spend quality time together. She doesn't see it as a power play but as a choice. She also says he can decline, so it's his decision. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the offer constitutes a power play. A power play usually involves using something (like sex) to gain control or force someone into a decision. The girl's offer is conditional: if he gives up gaming all day, then they have sex. But the guy feels it's manipulative because there's no benefit for her in him not gaming before they meet, only during their time together. \n\nHowever, she might see it as a way to prioritize intimacy over his gaming, which he seems to enjoy. The guy's frustration is that he's being asked to sacrifice something (gaming time before they meet) for her benefit. So, is this a legitimate power play or a difference in priorities?\n\nIn relationships, negotiation is key. Both partners have different needs. The guy values gaming, the girl values intimacy. When the girl offers an exchange, he might feel it's coercive, but she might see it as a mutual choice. The problem arises when one partner feels the other is using sex as a bargaining chip. However, the girl did present it as an offer, and he had the option to accept or decline. \n\nThe guy's reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and accusing her of trying to make him \"bend over\" might be seen as harsh, especially if she didn't intend it as a power play. That could come off as him dismissing her perspective and not engaging in a constructive discussion. On the other hand, if he genuinely feels manipulated, it's valid to express that concern. \n\nThe crux is whether the exchange is balanced. If the guy feels he's giving up something without her sacrificing anything, it's one-sided. She benefits from the exchange (sex) while he gives up gaming. That could be a power play if the intent is to control his behavior. However, if she's just trying to find a way to get closer intimacy without competition from his games, it's more about her desire for connection. \n\nAnother angle: The guy agreed to not have sex initially. Then she offers it if he gives up gaming. He might see it as a reward, but he's frustrated because he thought they were going to just hang out. She might feel that he's being too attached to games and wants to prioritize her need for physical intimacy. \n\nIn the end, communication is key. Both need to discuss their needs and boundaries. If the guy feels that using sex as a condition for his behavior is manipulative, it's a valid concern. However, if she's genuinely not trying to control him and is just presenting another option, then maybe it's not a power play. \n\nBut the guy's reaction of calling her out on it might have escalated things. He could have asked why she felt that way instead of accusing her. However, his stance is that he's not okay with that dynamic, which is his right. \n\nGiven that the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer would be B (No), because he's expressing his boundaries and not okay with feeling controlled. However, there's also a case for A if his reaction was disproportionate. But given the context, since he's standing up for himself about something he finds manipulative, B is more likely.\n"
