She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and his girlfriend. The main issue seems to be about using sex as a power play. Let me break down the events step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend doesn't want to have sex tonight and wants to chill and do other things. The author agrees, which is good. Then they start planning their evening. The author suggests playing video games, and the girlfriend prefers doing something together. The author is okay with that. \n\nThen, the girlfriend offers that they can have sex if the author doesn't play any video games. The author initially thinks he can play before she arrives but the girlfriend insists that he shouldn't play at all that day. The author gets upset, calling it holding sex over his head, and accuses her of using it as a power play. The girlfriend says it's just an offer and a difference of opinion. Now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. So the author's main point is that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. He feels pressured to give up something he wants (playing games) in exchange for sex. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as an offer where both parties can benefit. But the author argues that the benefit for her is just having him not play games, which doesn't give her anything, while he gives up his time. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. The girlfriend might be feeling that the author only prioritizes games, and she wants quality time together. By offering sex as an option, she might be trying to show that she values intimacy but also wants to balance other activities. However, the author perceives this as manipulation.\n\nIs using a trade-off like this inherently wrong? In relationships, people sometimes use \"if you do this, then I'll do that\" as a way to negotiate. But when it involves something as personal as sex, it can be seen as a power play if one person feels coerced. The line between negotiation and manipulation can be blurry here.\n\nThe author's frustration seems valid if he feels he's being forced to choose between his interests and intimacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend is trying to express her needs. The key issue might be communication. The author felt that the offer was one-sided, benefiting only himself, which he called a power play. The girlfriend didn't see it that way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for calling it a power play? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for making the offer? The question is whether the author is wrong. If using conditional sex is a form of manipulation, then the girlfriend is at fault. But if it's a negotiation, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author agreed to the initial offer (no games during the evening for sex), but then wanted to play before she arrived. The girlfriend changed her terms to no games all day. The author felt that was unfair because the games before their time together shouldn't matter. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the benefit isn't mutual. If the girlfriend wanted to have sex, she's trading that for the author not gaming. But the author isn't gaining anything from not gaming except the possibility of sex. So it's a trade where the author is giving up something (gaming time) for something he wants (sex). That could be seen as the girlfriend holding sex as a reward, which might be a power dynamic. \n\nHowever, in relationships, such negotiations are common. The problem arises when one partner feels pressured or that the other is using it to manipulate. The author's reaction was anger and calling it \"power play,\" which might be a valid response if he feels uncomfortable with that dynamic. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might be trying to communicate her needs differently. If the author feels that the girlfriend is controlling his actions through conditional intimacy, that's a red flag. But if it's a mutual negotiation, maybe not. \n\nI think this is a tricky situation. The author could be right in feeling that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which is a form of manipulation. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be expressing her needs in a way she thinks is fair. The author's reaction might be valid, but so is the girlfriend's intention. It's a communication breakdown. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. Maybe I should consider if the author's response was too harsh. \n\nThe author called his girlfriend's offer a \"power play\" and said it's \"fucking up\" to use sex like that. That's pretty harsh language. Maybe the author overreacted. If the girlfriend was just offering an option without coercion, then the author's reaction could be unwarranted. However, if the girlfriend made it a conditional offer where the author felt pressured, then the author is justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries regarding being pressured to give up his interests for sex. But maybe the girlfriend's approach was manipulative. Alternatively, the author might be misinterpreting her intentions. \n\nWait, the girlfriend says it's just an offer and they can go back to the original plan. So she's not forcing him, but he's choosing to take the offer. But he's upset because he feels it's a power play. \n\nIn that case, maybe the author is projecting his discomfort with negotiation into calling it a power play. If the girlfriend isn't forcing him, then it's a mutual choice. However, the author's frustration is that the benefit is one-sided. \n\nI think the key point is whether the negotiation is about mutual compromise or one-sided control. The author feels it's the latter, so he's in the right to call it out. But the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because he's standing up for himself and recognizing the imbalance in the negotiation. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's offer is a fair exchange, then the author is wrong. But the author's perspective is that it's not a fair swap. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that his girlfriend is using a power play. He's validly expressing his discomfort with being pressured to give up his preferences for her conditional offer. The problem is the communication and differing perceptions, but the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
