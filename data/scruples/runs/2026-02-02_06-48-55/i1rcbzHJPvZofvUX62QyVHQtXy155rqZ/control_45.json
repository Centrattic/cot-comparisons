She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend were making plans for the evening. She wanted to avoid sex that night and suggested other activities, but then later offered that if he didn't play video games at all that day, they could have sex. The author felt like she was using sex as a power play, but she says it's just an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend initially didn't want to have sex, so she suggested other activities. Then, when the author suggested playing video games, she made a conditional offer: no games today for sex. The author felt this was manipulative because the only benefit for her is getting sex, while he loses the ability to play games before she arrives. He refused, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He felt that the offer was a power play because it's a one-sided condition. He agreed not to play during their time together, but she extended it to all day. He thought it was unfair because playing before she came over shouldn't affect the evening plans. He saw it as a way to control his behavior, which he found manipulative.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She might see it as a mutual decision. She was trying to balance her desire for non-sexual time with his interest in gaming. The offer was a way to find a compromise where he gives up one activity (gaming) for another (sex). She might not see it as a power play but rather as a way to express her needs and see if they can agree on a different activity. She clarified that he could decline, so it's a choice for both sides.\n\nIs using a conditional offer where one party gives up an activity for a specific benefit (sex) a form of power play? That's debatable. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs and negotiating compromises. However, if one partner is using a conditional offer to manipulate the other into doing something by withholding affection or sex, that's a power play. But if it's presented as an option, then both parties can accept or reject it. \n\nThe key here is the author's perception. He felt that the condition was unnecessary and one-sided. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see it as a fair exchange. The problem arises when one person feels pressured or that their needs are not respected. The author might be right if he believes that his right to play games before her arrival was being unfairly restricted. However, the girlfriend's right to set boundaries around her consent and how she wants to spend her time is also valid.\n\nIn consensual relationships, both partners should have the autonomy to set boundaries. If the girlfriend is offering an option, it's not inherently a power play. However, the author felt that the offer was being used to control his behavior, which could indicate a power dynamic. The fact that the author felt the need to label it as a power play suggests that he perceived it as manipulative, which is a valid feeling if he felt his autonomy was being compromised. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's offer was a genuine attempt to negotiate, then the author's reaction might be overstepping by accusing her of manipulation without considering her perspective. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, so maybe both sides have valid points here. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and how the girlfriend intended the offer. If she genuinely saw it as a choice and not a manipulation tactic, then the author might be taking it the wrong way. However, if the girlfriend was indeed using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior, then the author is right to call it out. Since the situation is presented as a mutual offer with the option to decline, it's possible that the author is overreacting. But from his perspective, he felt manipulated, which is a real issue. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If using a conditional offer (even if it's one-sided) is considered a power play, then he's right to feel that way, so he's not in the wrong. If such an offer is acceptable in consensual negotiation, then he's in the wrong for accusing her of manipulation. Given that the girlfriend clarified it's an offer he can decline, the author's reaction might be overstepping, making him in the wrong. But the initial answer could be either way. The key is the definition of a power play. If the girlfriend is using sex as a means to control behavior (even by offering it), that's a power play. Therefore, the author's perspective is valid, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
