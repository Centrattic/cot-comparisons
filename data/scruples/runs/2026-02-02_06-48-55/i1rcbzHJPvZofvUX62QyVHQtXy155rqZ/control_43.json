She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend are making plans. She initially asks to not have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to just hang out. He agrees. Then they discuss other activities, like video games. He suggests playing games, she prefers doing something together. He wants to play games because he hasn't in a while. \n\nThen she offers a trade: if he doesn't play games at all today, they can have sex. He tries to clarify that he can play before she arrives, but she insists it's all day. He refuses and gets upset, calling it a power play. She says it's just an offer, and they end up not talking anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual expectations and how they're negotiating their time together. The author feels that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. The girlfriend sees it as an offer, not a power play. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. In relationships, communication is key. The author's concern is valid because it's not okay for one partner to withhold intimacy as a way to get what they want if it's not a mutual agreement. However, the girlfriend might see the offer as a way to propose an alternative activity that she prefers. But when one partner uses a non-negotiable demand (no games all day for sex) where the other sees it as an ultimatum, that can be a form of manipulation. \n\nThe author is within his rights to express discomfort with the situation and set boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction not seeing it as a power play but just a difference of opinion might indicate that she isn't recognizing the imbalance in the exchange. The author isn't wrong for standing up for himself when he feels pressured. So, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
