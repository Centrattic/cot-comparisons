She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the girlfriend is using sex as a power play. The author wanted to make plans for their evening, and the girlfriend initially suggested not having sex so they could do other things. The author agreed. Then they discussed activities, and she proposed that if he didn't play games at all that day, they could have sex later. The author felt this was a power play, declined, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is that the girlfriend is using sex as a condition for him giving up something (playing games). He sees it as a power move where she's trying to control his behavior. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see it as a mutual decision, a way to compromise, or maybe she just wanted to prioritize intimacy over games. \n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's condition is a form of manipulation or if it's a legitimate negotiation. If she's setting boundaries or expressing her needs, that's one thing. But if she's using sex as a reward to get him to comply with her demands, that's more of a power play. The author argues that the condition (not playing games before he sees her) doesn't benefit her, only him. So he sees it as her trying to get him to sacrifice something for her. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's intention was to have quality time together without distractions. If she wanted to be fully present during their time together, maybe she felt that him playing games beforehand would affect their mood. However, the author's point is that the timing doesn't matter, only that he gives up games entirely. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about consent and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is making the author feel pressured to give up something he's comfortable with for sex, that could be an issue. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect where both parties can express needs without using power plays. The author's frustration is valid if he feels manipulated. The girlfriend's response that it's just an offer might not account for how it's perceived as a conditional power move. However, the author's tone in calling it \"fucked up\" might come off as accusatory, which could escalate the conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her perspective and dismissed her offer as manipulative without discussion, maybe he's too quick to judge. The girlfriend might have had different reasoning. But if she's using sex to control his behavior, that's a problem. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the author felt it was a power play and she doesn't see it that way, it's a matter of differing opinions. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) if the manipulation is real, but sometimes people might not see their own behavior as manipulative. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if he's overstepping by not respecting her boundaries. But the scenario shows he's trying to set boundaries too. \n\nHmm. The main issue is the conditional use of sex. If she's using it to get him to comply, that's a power play. The author's perspective is that it's a power play, and he's standing up for himself. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries against what he perceives as manipulation.\n"
