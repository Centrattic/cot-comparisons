She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The key issue is the girlfriend's response when the author suggests playing video games before she arrives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author and girlfriend were making plans. She initially wanted to not have sex that night, so he agreed. Then he suggested video games, which she didn't prefer. She offered sex in exchange for him not playing games at all on that day, even before she arrived. He felt this was using sex as a power play, leading to an argument and now they aren't speaking.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me analyze both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: He agreed not to have sex if they could play games during their evening. But when she clarified that he couldn't play games even before she arrived, he felt it was unfair. He interpreted her offer as a power play where she was withholding sex to get her way. His main point is that not playing games before they meet doesn't benefit her, so her demand seems manipulative.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She made an offer, not a demand. She was trying to find a middle ground. She didn't see it as a power play but as a compromise. She was okay with proceeding with the original plan if he declined her offer. She might feel that she was giving him a choice, and if he didn't take it, that's his decision.\n\nNow, considering power dynamics. Using sex as a way to get someone to comply can be seen as a power play if it's a condition for intimacy. However, the girlfriend did say it was an offer, and the author had the right to decline. The issue here is whether the offer was unfair. The author argues that the condition (no games all day) only benefits him (by getting sex) without giving her anything in return. That seems like a one-sided trade, which could be manipulative. But she might see it as a fair exchange for not having sex when she doesn't want to. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author might have felt that the girlfriend's terms were unreasonable, while she felt she was making a compromise. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels his needs (playing games before she arrives) are being dismissed. However, the girlfriend might feel that she's being considerate by offering another option.\n\nAlso, the timing is important. The author could play games before she arrives, so the overlap during their time together is the main issue. But the girlfriend extended the condition to the entire day, which might have been unexpected. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he did call her out for using sex as a power play, which could be seen as accusatory. If the girlfriend was trying to negotiate without pressure, then his reaction might be overly harsh. However, if the offer was indeed a conditional trade for something she wanted (no games during their time together), then he's not in the wrong for standing his ground. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the girlfriend's offer was manipulative. If she was using sex as a bargaining chip to get him not to play games even before they met, that could be a power play. But she said it was an offer, and he had the choice to decline. The author's issue is that the condition doesn't benefit her. So maybe he's correct in feeling it's a power play. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend was trying to be flexible, offering an alternative to just not having sex. But since the condition extended beyond their time together, the author felt it was unfair. \n\nIn conclusion, both sides have valid points. However, the author's reaction might have been a bit confrontational. He could have approached the situation with more dialogue instead of immediately labeling it a power play. On the other hand, the girlfriend's offer could indeed be seen as manipulative if it's a conditional trade without mutual benefit. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's condition was one-sided and the author is justified in feeling it's a power play. But I need to check if there's any cultural or social norms I'm missing. In some contexts, negotiating terms for intimacy is normal, but when it's conditional and not mutually beneficial, it can be problematic. Therefore, the author's stance is reasonable, and he's not in the wrong.\n"
