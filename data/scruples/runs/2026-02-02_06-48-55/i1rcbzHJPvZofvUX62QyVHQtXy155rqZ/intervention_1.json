She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about having sex versus playing video games. The author is upset because his girlfriend made a conditional offer where he couldn't play games before or during their time together unless they had sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author agreed to not play games during their evening, but the girlfriend wanted him to not play at all that day, including before she arrived. He felt that was using sex as a power play. She sees it as an offer. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend might feel that her request is about balancing their time together without distractions. She might think that if he plays games before she arrives, his mind is preoccupied, affecting their time together. But the author sees it as a manipulation tactic, expecting him to give up something (gaming) for her to give him something else (sex).\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for thinking she's using sex as a power play. The key here is consent and mutual respect. If both parties are communicating their needs and boundaries, it's about finding a compromise. The author's frustration stems from feeling that his needs (to game before meeting her) are being dismissed for a condition that's not reciprocal. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's request isn't entirely unreasonable if she feels that her needs for undivided attention are important. But making it conditional on having sex could be seen as using that as leverage, which the author rightly finds manipulative. The problem arises when one party feels their boundaries are being overstepped. \n\nIn healthy relationships, power dynamics shouldn't be used to control the other person's actions. The girlfriend's condition might not be a power play in her eyes, but if it makes the author feel coerced into giving up his activities for her to agree to sex, that's a problem. \n\nThe author's reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and not okay could be seen as valid if he feels his autonomy is being compromised. However, he might be wrong if he's not considering her perspective. The main issue is whether the condition is a fair negotiation or a manipulation tactic. \n\nSince the author's main argument is that the condition isn't reciprocal (he gives up games for her to have sex, but she doesn't reciprocate), and she doesn't see it that way, it's a communication breakdown. Both might have valid points, but the author's frustration is understandable if he feels his needs aren't being respected. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. It's more about the communication and understanding each other's boundaries. So the answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
