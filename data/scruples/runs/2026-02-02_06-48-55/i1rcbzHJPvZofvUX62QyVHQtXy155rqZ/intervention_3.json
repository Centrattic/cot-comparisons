She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking his girlfriend is using sex as a power play. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend are planning their evening. She wants to not have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to just hang out. He agrees, and they decide on dinner and games. Then he suggests she bring her game systems, and she prefers to do something together instead. He wants to play games because he hasn't in a while. She then offers that if he doesn't play games tonight (before she arrives and during their time together), then they can have sex. He initially says that's fine, playing before she arrives, but she insists it can't be at all today. When he objects, he accuses her of using sex as a power play. She sees it as an offer, not a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, the author's main point is that she's using sex as a bargaining chip. He sees her condition as a power move where she's trying to get him to give up something (his gaming time) to get her desired outcome (sex). She counters that it's just an offer and he's free to decline. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about consent and mutual respect. In a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable about the terms of their interactions. If one partner is using a conditional offer to get the other to comply, that could be seen as a power play. But is that the case here?\n\nThe author is upset because she's linking his activity (not gaming) to their sexual activity. He feels that by giving up his gaming time (even if it's before she arrives), he's giving up something to get sex, which he perceives as her using sex as a bargaining chip. She might see it as a mutual exchange where she's offering a benefit (sex) in exchange for his compliance. However, if the exchange is one-sided (he gives up his gaming time, but she gains the benefit of not gaming while they hang out and also gets to have sex), then it's a power play.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked to give up something he values (gaming time) to get a desired outcome (sex). If he feels that his enjoyment is being traded for her benefit, that's a power imbalance. On the other hand, she might see it as a fair offer since she's also giving up having sex to spend time gaming, but in this case, she's actually not giving up sex; she's offering it as a conditional reward. \n\nBut wait, she initially wanted to not have sex, so by offering sex if he complies, she's actually changing her stance. That could be seen as a form of leverage. If the offer is conditional and the other person feels pressured, it's a power play. However, if she genuinely sees it as an option and he's free to take or leave, then it's just an offer. The problem arises when one partner uses an offer to manipulate or pressure the other into giving up something to get something else.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he feels that his autonomy is being undermined. He's not okay with the idea that he has to give up something (gaming time) to get sex. In healthy relationships, both parties should feel that their needs are met without using conditional offers. If one partner is using such conditions, it might indicate a problem. However, if both are comfortable and it's a mutual choice, then it's not necessarily wrong. But in this case, the author is clearly upset because he feels coerced, and she's not seeing it the same way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's accusing her of using sex as a power play when she actually sees it as a fair offer, maybe he's misreading her intentions. On the other hand, if she is indeed using conditional offers to get her way, he's justified in feeling that way. The key is whether the offer is a fair exchange or a form of manipulation. The author might be right in his perception if the offer is one-sided. However, the way he reacts\u2014calling it \"fucked up\" and refusing to comply\u2014might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. He's not wrong to feel that the offer is unfair, but his approach to confronting her might have been abrupt, leading to the breakdown in communication. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the offer is a legitimate mutual choice or a power play. Given the author's perspective, he believes it's the latter, and given that she doesn't see it the same way, it's a conflict in perceptions. The question is whether he's wrong to feel that way. Since using sex as a conditional offer can be a form of power play, he's not entirely wrong. However, if she genuinely meant it as an offer without leverage, then his reaction might be overly harsh. But given the context, where she's the one making the conditional offer, and he's the one feeling it's coercive, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. His stance on not wanting to be manipulated is valid. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
