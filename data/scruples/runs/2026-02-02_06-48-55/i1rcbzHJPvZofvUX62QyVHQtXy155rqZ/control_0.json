She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is trying to make plans with his girlfriend. She initially says she doesn't want to have sex that night because she wants to just hang out and do other things. The author agrees, and they start planning dinner and other activities. The author suggests playing video games, which the girlfriend says she wants to do something together instead. The author says he really wants to play games because of midterms and hasn't been able to. The girlfriend then offers that if he doesn't play games at all today, they can have sex that night. The author initially agrees but then clarifies that playing before she arrives is okay, but she insists that he can't play any at all. When she says they can just not have sex then, the author gets upset, saying she's using sex as a power play. The girlfriend argues it's just an offer, and they're not talking now.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, mutual respect, and power dynamics in the relationship. The author feels that the girlfriend is using sex as a reward to get him to comply with her terms (not playing games all day). The girlfriend says it's an offer, not a power play. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs are being considered without using conditional rewards or punishments. If one person is using something like sex as a way to get the other to do what they want, that can be seen as a power imbalance. However, if both parties are comfortable with the terms, even if it's a trade-off, it might not be a problem. But in this case, the girlfriend's offer is conditional on the author giving up something (not playing games before their time together) to have sex. The author feels that the condition is unnecessary because the time before she arrives is his own, and the benefit (sex) is only one-sided. \n\nThe girlfriend might not see it as a power play, but the author is arguing that it's a tactic to make him give in. The author's frustration is about the perceived manipulation, and the girlfriend's response is that it's a difference of opinion. \n\nFrom a general perspective, using sex as a conditional offer can be problematic if it creates a power imbalance or if one person feels pressured. Consent should be enthusiastic and mutual, not based on trade-offs that one party feels they can't refuse. The author's point is that he's being asked to sacrifice his own time (playing games before she arrives) for a benefit that's only for her. However, the girlfriend might see it as a fair exchange where she's giving up sex for his not playing games during their time together. \n\nBut the author is arguing that the benefit isn't mutual because the time before she arrives is his own, and the offer is only about during their time together. So if he gives up playing any games all day (including before she arrives) to have sex during their time together, it's a one-sided exchange. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author feels it's a power play because she's using sex to get him to comply with her terms. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the girlfriend's actions are manipulative or not. If she's using sex as a bargaining chip to get him to do what she wants, then it's a power play. The author is justified in feeling that way if he doesn't agree to such terms. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is just making an offer and the author is refusing it, then he isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the girlfriend's offer is a power play. The author's perspective is that it is, and he's not okay with it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort with the perceived manipulation. It's a difference in how they view the situation, and the author is standing up for his boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
