She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author thinking his girlfriend is using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially asked not to have sex that night, which the author agreed to. Then, she offered to have sex if he didn't play video games at all that day, not just during their time together. The author felt this was a manipulation tactic because he was willing to give up gaming during their evening but not before she arrived. He got upset, called it a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn the author's side, he might feel that his partner is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. The offer to have sex only if he gives up gaming entirely (before and during) could be seen as a conditional offer, which he found manipulative. He did agree to not play during their time together, but the girlfriend extended the condition to his entire day. He felt that's an unfair power move.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she might be trying to express her desires without coercion. She presented it as an offer, not a demand, and said he could decline. She might see it as a way to communicate her preference for intimacy versus other activities. She didn't force him; he had the choice to accept or not. She might feel that the author is misinterpreting her intent as a power play when it was just a suggestion.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether using sex as a condition for mutual activities is a power play. Power dynamics in relationships can be complex. If one partner uses a desired activity (sex) to influence the other's behavior (not gaming), it can be seen as manipulation. However, if both partners are negotiating and there's mutual consent, it's part of normal relationship dynamics.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured. However, the girlfriend claims it was an offer, and he did have the option to refuse. The author's reaction of calling it \"fucked up\" and \"power play\" might be overreacting if the girlfriend didn't intend it that way. Alternatively, if the author genuinely felt coerced, that's a problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties need to express their needs without making the other feel controlled. The author's right to enjoy gaming before their meetup isn't invalid, and the girlfriend's desire for intimacy is also valid. The conflict arises from how they negotiated these preferences.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he dismissed her offer as a power play without understanding her perspective. Conversely, the girlfriend might be in the wrong if her conditions crossed into manipulation. The fact that they're not speaking now suggests a breakdown in communication. \n\nI think the author's perspective is valid in feeling that his partner is using sex to influence his behavior, which can be a form of manipulation. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also valid if she's just trying to express her desires. The answer depends on the intent and how both parties perceive the negotiation. Since the girlfriend didn't force him and offered an alternative, the author might be overreacting. But if he genuinely felt pressured, it's a problem.\n\nGiven the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's conditions could be seen as a power play if they're using sex as a conditional reward for behavior. However, since she presented it as an offer, the author's reaction might be the bigger issue here. The answer is probably B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's conditions could be manipulative, but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the author is misreading her intentions, then A. But given the analysis, B makes sense.\n"
