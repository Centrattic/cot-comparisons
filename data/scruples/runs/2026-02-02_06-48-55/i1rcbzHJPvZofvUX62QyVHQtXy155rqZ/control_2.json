She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially says she doesn't want to have sex and wants to just hang out. The author agrees, and they plan to do other activities. Then the girlfriend offers sex if the author gives up playing games entirely for the day, not just during their time together. The author feels this is a power play because he's being asked to sacrifice something (gaming time) before they meet, which doesn't benefit her, just to get sex. He's upset and calls it using sex as leverage. She doesn't see it that way and thinks it's just an offer.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author's main issue is that the trade seems one-sided. He's required to give up something (pre-visit gaming) for her benefit, but she's not offering anything equivalent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see it as a way to balance their time together, maybe feeling she's given up sex multiple times and now wants to have it once, hence the exchange. However, the author's right to set boundaries is important here. If he's uncomfortable with the condition, he's not in the wrong for expressing that. She has the right to set her own conditions, but if the author feels it's a power play, and he refuses to comply, he's not wrong to stand his ground. The problem might be communication\u2014she might not realize how he's perceiving her offer. But based on the details, the author isn't in the wrong for his reaction since he's asserting his boundaries and pointing out what he sees as an imbalance. So the answer is B.\n"
