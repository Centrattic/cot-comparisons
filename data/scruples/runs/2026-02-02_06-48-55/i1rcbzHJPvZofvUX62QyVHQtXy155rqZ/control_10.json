She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing plans for their evening. The girlfriend asks not to have sex, and the guy is okay with that. Then when suggesting games, the girlfriend offers sex if he doesn't play games at all. The guy feels like she's using sex as a power play, and now they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the girlfriend's offer is a power play. The guy argues that the offer (no games = sex) doesn't benefit her if he gives up games before they meet. He feels it's manipulative. She says it's just an offer and a difference of opinion.\n\nSo, power play implies using something to gain control in a relationship. If she's using the possibility of sex as a condition for his behavior (not playing games), that could be seen as a power move. On the other hand, he agreed not to play during their time together. But when he offered to play before she arrives, she insisted he not play at all, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe guy's main point is that she's using sex as leverage to get him to conform. She counters that it's an offer, not a manipulation. The question is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Both parties have different expectations. The girlfriend wanted to have sex and framed it as a condition. The guy felt pressured and saw it as manipulative. \n\nIs the author wrong for thinking that? It depends on definitions. If a power play is using sex to control, then yes, she might be. But if she's just making a mutual decision, then not. However, the guy's frustration is valid if he feels coerced. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the guy) is wrong. The answer hinges on whether his interpretation is correct. If the girlfriend is using conditional sex as a way to influence his behavior, then the guy's perspective is valid. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
