She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing plans for the evening, where the girlfriend suggests a trade-off for sex. The author is upset that she made having sex conditional on him not playing video games at all on the day, even if it's before she arrives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author agreed not to play games during their time together but wanted to play before she came over. The girlfriend offered sex if he gave up all games for the day, which he saw as a power play. She, on the other hand, might see it as a mutual decision, an offer where both sides get something. But the key point is whether her condition was a fair negotiation or a manipulation tactic.\n\nFrom the author's viewpoint, he felt that the condition was unfair because the benefit (sex) is primarily for him, and the cost (giving up games all day) is on him. He sees it as a power play to get him to comply. The girlfriend might argue that it's a reasonable compromise, maybe she wants more quality time without distractions, even before they meet. But if the benefit is one-sided, it could be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The author's frustration is about the fairness of the trade. If the girlfriend is making the choice to not have sex unless he gives up something, it's a form of control, even if unintentional. However, if she's just offering an alternative plan, maybe it's a matter of differing expectations. \n\nBut the critical factor is whether the girlfriend's request is a legitimate negotiation or a manipulation tactic. If she's using the possibility of sex to influence his behavior, regardless of her intent, it can be considered a power play. The author felt coerced, even if she didn't mean it that way. In healthy relationships, both parties should feel comfortable discussing needs without using conditional offers that create pressure.\n\nSo, considering that, the author's reaction might be justified. If the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional offer to get her way, even slightly, the author is right to push back. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a chance the user might think the author overreacted. But based on the argument presented, the author's perspective is valid.\n"
