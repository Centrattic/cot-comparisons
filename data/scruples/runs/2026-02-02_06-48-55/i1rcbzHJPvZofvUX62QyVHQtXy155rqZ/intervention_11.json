She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend regarding sex and video games.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author wanted to plan a night without having sex, which they usually do every time they hang out. He suggested playing video games, but the girlfriend wanted to do something together. She then proposed that if he didn't play video games at all that day, they could have sex that night. The author felt like she was using sex as a bargaining chip, which he found manipulative. She, on the other hand, saw it as an offer and not a power play. The argument led to them not speaking and no plans for the night.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to assess both sides. The author's main issue is that the girlfriend is making a conditional offer where sex is contingent on him giving up an activity, which he sees as a power play. He feels it's unfair because not playing games before they meet doesn't benefit her, so it's one-sided. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's just making an offer, and he's free to decline. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties should feel that their needs are respected. The girlfriend's condition seems to be about balancing their time together without sex, but the way she framed it might have come off as manipulative. The author's reaction is based on feeling pressured, which is a valid emotion. However, his statement about it being a power play and her not seeing it as such might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did agree to the initial terms but then felt the terms were unfair. The problem might be that he didn't communicate his discomfort with the conditions upfront. Instead, he reacted strongly when she made the offer. On the other hand, the girlfriend's approach could be seen as using a conditional offer where sex is a reward for giving up an activity, which can be a power dynamic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both might have valid points. However, the author's framing of it as a power play might be a misunderstanding. The girlfriend's offer was a choice, and he was within his right to decline. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he feels that sex is being used as a bargaining chip. However, if the girlfriend's intention was just to have a different activity without the routine of sex, maybe there was a communication breakdown. \n\nConsidering that the author felt the terms were one-sided and manipulative, but the girlfriend saw it as an offer, it's possible that both misunderstood each other. The author's reaction might be overly confrontational, but his feelings are legitimate. The key here is whether using sex as a condition for another activity is seen as a power play. Some might say it's normal in relationships to have trade-offs, while others see it as manipulative. \n\nGiven that the author is not the one making the conditional offer, but rather the one who objects to it, the blame might not be on him. However, his approach in calling it a power play might be harsh, leading to the escalation. But ultimately, if a partner feels pressured, that's a problem. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his comfort and boundaries, even if the situation is a bit of a misunderstanding.\n"
