She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend is using sex as a power play, according to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and his girlfriend were making plans. She asked not to have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to just hang out. The author agreed. Then, during planning the evening, the author suggested playing video games, and the girlfriend said she wants to do something together instead. The author wanted to play games because he hasn't in a while. \n\nThen she said they could have sex if he didn't play any games. The author agreed but suggested he could play before she arrives. She clarified that he can't play at all that day. When he says that's not fair, she doesn't see it as a power play but just an offer. Now they're not speaking, and nothing is happening tonight.\n\nThe author is upset because he feels she's using sex as a bargaining chip. His reasoning is that if he gives up something (not playing games during their time together), he gets sex. But if he gives up playing games all day, there's no benefit for her except control. He sees it as a power play. The girlfriend says it's an offer and a difference of opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he feels that the girlfriend is using sex as a way to manipulate him into not gaming. He thinks that the trade is unfair because the only benefit for her is control, not a mutual exchange. He's not okay with that and called her out on it.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might see it as a mutual negotiation. She wanted to have sex but didn't want to do it every night. When the author wanted to play games, she offered an exchange: no games at all for sex. She might not see it as a power play but as a way to have her desire for sex fulfilled if he's willing to give up his gaming. She also agreed to an alternative if he didn't accept the offer, so she might see it as a fair choice.\n\nNow, the key here is whether using sex as a condition for something else is inherently a power play. Some people might find that okay as part of their relationship dynamics, while others might see it as transactional. The author is against it because he doesn't want sex to be conditional on giving up his own activities, especially when the exchange isn't balanced.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. If one partner feels that the other is using a sensitive issue (like sex) as a bargaining chip, that can be a problem. The author is expressing his discomfort with that dynamic. The girlfriend, however, doesn't see it that way and thinks it's a valid offer. \n\nIt's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries. However, the situation might also depend on their prior agreements or how they usually handle such matters. If they have a history of using such conditions, it might be a pattern. But since this is a one-time instance, it's more about differing perspectives.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the offer isn't a balanced exchange. She's getting the benefit of sex if he gives up his games, but there's no reciprocal benefit for him. In that case, it could be seen as a power play. However, in some relationships, people might negotiate differently. The problem arises when one person feels coerced or that their boundaries are being disrespected.\n\nThe girlfriend might not intend it as a power play, but the author's perception is valid. If he feels that she's using sex to control the situation, that's a legitimate concern. The fact that they are now not speaking and nothing is happening suggests that the communication has broken down. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and how they approach negotiations. If the girlfriend's approach is a one-time offer and the author is standing up for his boundaries, then he's not in the wrong. However, if there's a pattern of using sex as a bargaining chip, that could be problematic. Based on the given information, the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort with the dynamic and setting his boundaries, which is important in a healthy relationship. So the answer would be B.\n"
