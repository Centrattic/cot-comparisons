She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a disagreement between a couple regarding sex and video games.\n\nThe guy wants to play games before his girlfriend arrives, but she says if he plays at all that day, there won't be sex that night. He feels she's using sex as a power play. She thinks it's just an offer. They ended up not talking and nothing happening that night.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The girl said if he doesn't play games during their evening, they can have sex. The guy agreed but later objected to the fact that she tied sex to him not playing games before they meet. \n\nIs it a power play? Maybe. Using sex as a condition for an activity could be seen as manipulative. On the other hand, people do negotiate terms in relationships, but it's about how it's framed. The guy might feel pressured if his access to sex is contingent on giving up his own activity. But the girl might feel she's being fair by offering a choice. \n\nThe guy's frustration is about being restricted before their meetup. The girl might feel that his gaming during their time together is a problem. The problem arises when one person's terms affect the other's autonomy. The guy's argument is that the condition (no games at all today for sex) isn't balanced because it removes his freedom without a reciprocal benefit. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? The girl might be expressing her boundaries, but the way she's using sex as a conditional could be unhealthy. The guy has the right to express his feelings about the dynamic. However, he also has the right to decline her terms. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. Both could have communicated better. The girl's approach might be seen as a power play if it's about control rather than mutual satisfaction. The author's reaction is about asserting his boundaries as well. But maybe he could have approached it differently. However, the main issue is whether using sex as a condition for an activity is inherently wrong. \n\nIn relationships, such negotiations can happen, but they should be respectful. If one person feels manipulated, it's a problem. The girl might not see it that way, but the fact that they ended up not communicating suggests a breakdown in understanding each other's needs. \n\nThe answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries and recognizing the imbalance in the offer. However, the girl's perspective is also valid if she feels her needs aren't being met. But the key here is that the author isn't wrong for feeling that the situation is an unfair power dynamic. So, B might be the right choice.\n"
