She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend wanted to make plans for the evening. The girlfriend asked not to have sex that night, probably because they do it often. He agreed and suggested they play video games. She wanted to do something together instead. He wanted to play games since he hadn't recently. Then she offered sex if he didn't play games at all that day, even before she arrived. He felt that was holding sex over his head, so he got upset. She didn't see it that way, just an offer. Now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and mutual respect. The girlfriend is setting boundaries by saying she doesn't want to have sex that night. The boyfriend agreed to that. Then she changes the terms by offering sex if he doesn't play games before she arrives. He feels this is a power play because the benefit (sex) is one-sided; she gets to decide whether they have sex based on his activity before she even arrives. He's arguing that it's unfair to trade a sexual act for his personal activity, especially when it's before their time together.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's perspective might be that she's trying to make a compromise. She initially declined sex but then offered an alternative. However, the boyfriend might feel that his prior agreement to not have sex was a compromise, and now she's adding conditions that weren't discussed earlier. The issue is whether using the possibility of sex as a condition for another activity (not playing games) is a power play or just a negotiation.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both parties should communicate clearly and respect each other's needs. The girlfriend's condition could be seen as trying to influence his behavior, which the boyfriend perceives as manipulative. However, if she's open to other activities without the sex condition, maybe she's just trying to find a middle ground. But if he didn't agree to the new terms, then she's not forcing him. The problem is the framing of the offer and whether both parties feel respected.\n\nThe boyfriend's frustration is about feeling controlled by the conditional offer. The girlfriend doesn't see it that way. It's a conflict in how they perceive the negotiation. The key is whether both feel their needs are met and respected. Since the girlfriend's condition was to not play games at all (even before she arrives) in exchange for sex, and he didn't agree, the issue is about mutual understanding. The boyfriend might be right in feeling it's a power play if he didn't agree to play games before she arrived, which he thought was acceptable. The girlfriend might be overstepping by adding that condition. However, the boyfriend's reaction of calling it a power play might be harsh, as she's just making an offer. But if he didn't want to accept the terms, then he's not in the wrong for declining.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Both sides have valid points, but the girlfriend's conditional offer could be seen as trying to influence his behavior in a way that he finds unfair. The key is mutual respect and communication, and the author's stance is about not allowing sex to be used as a conditional trade, which is a reasonable boundary. So the author isn't wrong here.\n"
