She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple trying to plan their evening. The girlfriend says she wants to not have sex tonight and just hang out. The author agrees, but then when they're discussing activities, the girlfriend offers to have sex if he doesn't play video games at all. The author feels this is using sex as a power play, while the girlfriend thinks it's just an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the dynamics here. The key points are consent, mutual respect, and power dynamics in the relationship. The author felt that the girlfriend was using sex as a conditional offer, which made him uncomfortable. He saw it as a power play because he felt she was trying to control his actions (not playing games) in exchange for something else (sex). The girlfriend, on the other hand, saw it as a mutual offer where both could benefit.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs and boundaries are respected. The author's issue isn't with not playing games but with the conditions attached to the offer. If the girlfriend wanted to have sex only if he gave up his games, even before their time together, that could be seen as coercive. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. He didn't want to give up his gaming time, which was a personal activity he wanted to enjoy before the evening. The girlfriend's response that it's a difference of opinion might not resolve the underlying issue of how power is being used.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might have felt that she was being fair by offering an alternative activity. However, the problem arises when one partner uses a sexual benefit as a condition for another's actions, especially if it's not mutually beneficial. The author correctly pointed out that the condition (not playing games before they meet) doesn't benefit the girlfriend, making it a one-sided power play. \n\nIt's also important to consider communication. If the girlfriend's intention was merely to have a different activity together, she might have found a way to express that without attaching conditions to sex. The author's frustration stems from feeling manipulated, which is a valid concern if it's a recurring pattern. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong to feel that way. If the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior, that's a red flag. However, the situation is nuanced because both are trying to negotiate their evening. The key here is mutual respect and whether both parties are feeling heard and their boundaries respected. The author standing up for his boundary isn't wrong; it's about maintaining a healthy relationship dynamic. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why she's making the offer conditional and if it's fair to both sides.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries against what he perceives as manipulation, which is a valid concern in a healthy relationship.\n"
