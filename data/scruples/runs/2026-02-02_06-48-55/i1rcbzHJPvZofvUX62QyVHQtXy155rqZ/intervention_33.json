She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend and the boyfriend discussing plans. The girl wants to not have sex tonight and focus on other activities. The author agrees but then the girlfriend offers sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, not just during their time together. The author feels she's using sex as a power play.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted to make plans, and his girlfriend initially said she didn't want to have sex. He agreed. Then when he suggested video games, she offered sex in exchange for him not playing games at all that day, even before she arrives. The author felt that was unfair because it's before they meet, so he refused, got upset, and called it a power play. The girlfriend insists it's just an offer, and they're not talking anymore.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the girlfriend was using sex as a power play. The author argues that the offer doesn't benefit her, so it's a power play. The girlfriend says it's just an offer. So, is the author justified in his reaction?\n\nPower play implies using something (in this case, sex) to gain control or manipulate. If the girlfriend is making an offer where she gains something (sex) without giving up anything (since the author isn't playing games before they meet, which doesn't affect her), maybe the author is right. But maybe the girlfriend's perspective is that she's giving up something (not having sex) to allow him to play games, but that's not the case here. She wanted to not have sex tonight anyway. So offering sex in exchange for him not playing games (which he would do anyway before she comes) could be seen as using the sexual element to control his behavior, even if it's before their time together.\n\nBut then again, the author is the one who declined the offer, leading to no plans. The question is whether the girlfriend's action was a power play. The author thinks so, but she doesn't. So, is he wrong for thinking that? If the girlfriend's offer is a legitimate suggestion without manipulation, then the author might be overreacting. However, if the offer is a way to control his actions beyond the time they're together, it could be a power play. The author's main point is that his gaming before she arrives doesn't affect her, so there's no mutual benefit. So the girlfriend is trying to get him to change his behavior (not playing games at all) for her benefit (having sex), which doesn't benefit him except in the exchange. That could be seen as a power play.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's intention wasn't to control, just to have a way to get what she wants. The problem is that the author feels it's manipulative. The line between a genuine offer and a power play can be blurry. If the girlfriend is okay with not having sex if he declines, then maybe it's not a power play, but an offer she's willing to walk away from. However, the author's perspective is that the offer is a tactic to get him to comply, which feels coercive. The author is in a position where he feels he's being given an ultimatum, which he doesn't agree with. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is right that the offer is a power play, then he's justified. If the girlfriend genuinely meant it as an offer without manipulation, then the author might overreact. But from the author's description, the girlfriend's offer doesn't benefit her except to get him to do something (not play games before meeting) which she doesn't gain anything from. So maybe the author is right in seeing it as a power play. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
