She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a guy and his girlfriend regarding sex and video games. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy wanted to plan a night where they could hang out without having sex every time. He suggested playing video games, and the girlfriend offered that if he doesn't play games during their time together, they can have sex. He agreed but then realized she wanted him to not play games at all that day, even before she arrives. He felt this was using sex as a power play, so he got upset. The girlfriend says it was just an offer, and he's not wrong for declining, but he feels she's using sex to control him.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the guy) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. The key points are: the girlfriend's request to not play games at all that day in exchange for sex. The guy agreed to not play games during their time together, but the girlfriend extended it to before they meet. The guy feels this is manipulation, while the girlfriend sees it as an offer.\n\nNow, power dynamics. If one partner is using the threat of withholding intimacy to get the other to comply with their demands, that's a power play. The girlfriend's condition that he can't play games even before they meet might be pushing her boundaries. The guy is right to feel that the benefit (sex) is one-sided because not playing games beforehand doesn't benefit her. So maybe the girlfriend is using sex as leverage to control his actions outside their time together, which isn't fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy did agree to the initial terms of not playing during their time together. But the girlfriend escalated by adding an extra condition. The guy's reaction of getting upset is because he felt manipulated. It's important to communicate boundaries. If the girlfriend wants to set conditions for intimacy, both partners should agree without one feeling coerced. \n\nThe guy's perspective is that the offer wasn't mutually beneficial, so it's a power move. The girlfriend thinks it's just an offer. The question is whether the guy was wrong to call it out. If a partner feels that their autonomy is being controlled through intimacy, it's valid to express that. The guy's reaction might be a bit intense, but his point about it being a power play isn't entirely unfounded. However, he did have the choice to accept or decline the terms. \n\nBut using sex as a bargaining chip can be problematic. The girlfriend's approach might be seen as using intimacy to get her way, which can be unhealthy. The guy is right to set his boundary here. So maybe the girlfriend is in the wrong, making the guy not the asshole. But the user thinks the author is wrong. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. If the girl is using sex to manipulate, then the guy isn't wrong for standing up for himself. However, if the offer was just a suggestion and the guy refused without understanding her perspective, maybe there's nuance. But given the information, the guy's main issue is the unilateral control, which is valid. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
