She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault (AITA) for thinking his girlfriend is using sex as a power play. The situation involves their plans for the evening and a conflict over video games and sex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially declines sex and wants to just hang out. The author agrees. Then, when they discuss activities, she offers sex in exchange for him not playing video games at all that day. The author feels this is a power play because he thinks not playing games before their time together doesn't benefit her, and he's upset that she's using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and consent. The author feels the offer is one-sided, where he gives up something (not playing games) for her benefit (sex). The girlfriend sees it as an offer he can accept or decline. The author's frustration is about feeling pressured to comply with her conditions, which he perceives as manipulative.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel their needs are respected. If one partner uses sex as a conditional exchange for something they're not required to give up, that can be problematic. The author is standing up for his right to enjoy his own time (playing games before she arrives) without feeling it's a transactional demand from her. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel she's asserting her needs for intimacy and connection, which is also valid.\n\nWhether the author is in the wrong depends on if his reaction was out of line. He didn't force her to do anything; he declined her offer, which she agreed was an option. He's expressing his boundaries, which is okay. She's also setting her boundaries. The conflict arises from differing perspectives on how to express needs. Since both are stating their positions without coercion, it's more about a misunderstanding in communication. The author isn't in the wrong for calling out what he sees as a power play, as he's advocating for his own comfort and boundaries.\n"
