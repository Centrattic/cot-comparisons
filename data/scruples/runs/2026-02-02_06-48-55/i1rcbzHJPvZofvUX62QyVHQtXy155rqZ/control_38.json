She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend initially wanted to skip sex and do something else. The author agreed. Then, they discussed plans, and the author suggested video games. The girlfriend then offered sex if he didn't play games at all that day, including before she arrived. The author felt this was a power play because he wanted to play before she came over, not during their time together. He got upset and called it holding sex over his head. She didn't see it that way, just as an offer, and they ended up not talking.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The girlfriend made a conditional offer where her willingness to have sex depends on the author's actions. The author felt that the condition (no games at all that day) was unreasonable, especially since she didn't benefit from him not playing games before they met. \n\nUsing sex as a reward or punishment can be seen as a power dynamic where one partner uses intimacy to control the other. The author is correct in pointing out that the offer wasn't a mutual benefit but rather a conditional exchange where he sacrifices his desire to play games for her to have sex. This can create an imbalance. However, it's also important to consider that both partners have the right to set their boundaries and make requests. \n\nThe author's frustration likely stems from feeling that his autonomy was being restricted. However, the girlfriend's request, while perhaps seen as a power play by the author, might be her way of balancing the frequency of their sexual activity with other activities. The problem arises when one partner feels their needs are being manipulated. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using conditional statements that can feel coercive. The author's reaction is valid if he feels disrespected, but he might have approached the situation with more dialogue rather than immediately labeling it as a power play. On the other hand, the girlfriend's conditional offer could indeed be a form of using sex as leverage, which isn't healthy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The girlfriend's approach might be the issue here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
