She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author and his girlfriend discussing their plans for the night. The girlfriend wants to spend time together without having sex, which they usually do every time they hang out. The author agrees, and they start planning activities like cooking and video games. Then the girlfriend offers that they can have sex if he doesn't play video games at all that day, not even before she arrives. The author refuses, calling it using sex as a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend wants to set boundaries, maybe to prioritize other activities and have a different kind of evening. The author feels that she's holding sex over his head, using it as a reward for him giving up gaming. But is he wrong for thinking that? Let's break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend's request to not have sex that night seems reasonable. She's just asking for a different activity, which he initially agreed to. Then she offers an alternative: if he skips gaming entirely, they can have sex. The author sees this as a manipulation tactic, where she's trading sex for his compliance with her condition. But maybe she's just trying to make a choice between two scenarios: gaming together (without sex) or a more intimate evening (sex) if he gives up gaming entirely.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he feels that the offer isn't fair because he's giving up something (gaming before she arrives) for something he wants (sex). The girlfriend might see it as an option, not a punishment or a power move. However, the author's frustration is valid because he perceives it as using sex to control the situation. When he says he's upset about being prohibited from enjoying himself before she arrives, he's pointing out that the condition isn't about their time together but a personal choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is trying to negotiate her needs without pressure, but the author feels manipulated, it's more about mutual understanding. Both have valid feelings. However, using sex as a conditional reward could be seen as a power play if one party is using it to gain control. The author's reaction might be a bit intense, but his concern about manipulation is a valid perspective. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but that doesn't make him entirely wrong. They both need to communicate better. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe he could approach the conversation more calmly next time instead of getting upset. However, the immediate question is whether he's wrong in this scenario. Since the girlfriend made a conditional offer and he declined, seeing it as a power move, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
