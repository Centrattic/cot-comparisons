She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation involves a disagreement about having sex versus playing video games.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's girlfriend wants to spend time together without sex, so she declines sex and suggests other activities. The author agrees, but then the girlfriend offers to have sex if he skips playing games entirely. The author feels this is using sex as a power play, while she sees it as an offer he can accept or decline.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author thinks that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining tool, making him give up something he wants (gaming time) for the possibility of sex. The girlfriend, on the other hand, frames it as an offer, not a punishment or a power move. She's okay with proceeding without sex if he declines.\n\nNow, considering consent and healthy communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without manipulating the other. The girlfriend's offer might be seen as conditional, which can be problematic if it's perceived as a trade-off where one partner's desires are prioritized over the other's. However, if she's not pressuring him and is willing to accept his choice, maybe it's not entirely her fault.\n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling that the girlfriend is using sex as leverage. He might be right if she's using it to get him to comply with her wishes. But the line between a suggestion and a power play can be subjective. The girlfriend might not see it as manipulation, just as a mutual decision to spend time together differently.\n\nAlso, the author's willingness to compromise initially (agreeing to not have sex) but then feeling upset when he's asked to give up more (gaming time before she arrives) shows a conflict in expectations. The girlfriend's clarification that it's all or nothing (no games at all for sex) might be where the author feels disrespected. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's possible that both have valid points. The girlfriend's approach could be seen as using sex to influence his behavior, which is a form of manipulation. However, if she's not forcing him and is okay with the alternative, maybe it's a communication issue rather than a clear wrong. The author's reaction might be overreacting to an offer he perceives as unfair, but he's also expressing his boundaries, which is important.\n\nSo, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is using sex as a condition for her own satisfaction (playing games before she comes over), it's a power play if the author feels uncomfortable. The author is standing up for his boundaries, which is right. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
