She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for thinking their girlfriend is using sex as a power play. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy wanted to make plans for the evening and his girlfriend initially said she wanted to not have sex that night. He agreed and they started planning other activities. Then she offered that if he didn't play video games at all that day, they could have sex that night. He felt this was a power play because she was using sex as a reward to get him to give up his gaming. He got upset and accused her of holding sex over his head. She says it was just an offer, and he declined, leading to no plans.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key here is whether using sex as a condition for an activity is a power play. The guy sees it as manipulative because the offer only benefits him (getting to have sex) in exchange for giving up something she doesn't gain from. She sees it as a mutual offer, but the problem is that the benefit is one-sided. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using conditional statements that create pressure. If one person is using a desire activity (like sex) as a reward to get another to comply with a demand (no video games), that can be seen as coercive or manipulative. \n\nThe guy's reaction was to feel upset and accuse her of power play, which is a valid response if he believes the conditions are unfair. On the other hand, she might feel she was just making a suggestion, but the way it's framed could indeed be problematic. \n\nThe main issue is whether the girlfriend's offer is an act of control. The author isn't wrong to feel that way if he doesn't want his personal choices (like gaming before she arrives) to be dictated by her conditions. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong), because the author is justified in feeling that using sex as a condition for other activities is a power play, especially when the other side isn't giving up anything significant.\n"
