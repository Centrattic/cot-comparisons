She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's trying to make plans with his girlfriend. She wants to spend the night without having sex, which they usually do every time they hang out. He agrees, and they start planning dinner and activities. He suggests playing video games, but she wants to do something together. He says he wants to play because he hasn't had time due to midterms. She then offers that if he doesn't play any games today (including before she arrives), they can have sex. He initially thought it was just during their time together, but she clarifies it's all day. He gets upset, calls it a power play, and they end up not talking and nothing happening.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to not have sex and have a different activity. The author agreed. Then, he suggested games, she wanted to do something together. He insisted on games, she made an offer: no games (all day) for sex. He felt this was using sex as a power play. She says it's an offer, not a power play.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's frustrated because he thought the agreement was only during their time together. When she extended it to all day, including before she arrived, he felt manipulated. He saw it as a tactic to control him. She, on the other hand, sees it as a mutual decision where he can choose to accept or decline.\n\nIs she using sex as a power play? If someone conditions intimacy on a partner giving up something they want, it can be seen as a power play. But maybe the girlfriend felt she needed to set boundaries. However, the key point is that she's using sex as an incentive, which can be problematic if it's about control rather than mutual agreement.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from feeling that his choice to play games before she arrives shouldn't affect their time together. He feels she's holding sex over his head to get him to comply with her preference. She might see it as a valid negotiation, but if it's only beneficial to her (she gets to have sex without him playing games, which she might not like), it's more of a power play.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered her perspective. She might feel that when they're together, they should focus on each other, not on separate activities like gaming. But by extending the condition to before she arrives, which is his own time, it does seem like an overreach. He's willing to compromise on not playing during their time together, but she's pushing further, which he perceives as unfair.\n\nThe problem arises when the girlfriend uses a non-negotiable condition (no games all day) to get her way, and the author feels this is manipulative. However, she does offer an alternative (no sex, do something else), so technically, it's a choice. But if one option is only beneficial to her, it's a power play.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should feel their needs are respected. The author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to give up something he wants (gaming) just to get something he wants (sex). Conversely, the girlfriend might feel she's setting boundaries for their time together. However, the fact that she's using the absence of an activity (gaming) before their meeting as a condition for intimacy might cross into using sex as a bargaining chip, which is problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did call her out for making a power play, which she denies. He might be right if she's using manipulation, but he could also be overreacting. However, the key is whether his reaction is justified. Since he's standing up for himself and pointing out manipulative behavior, he might be in the right. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's request is about mutual understanding, then maybe the author is being too rigid.\n\nBut considering the definition of a power play, which is using control to manipulate, the girlfriend's condition does fit that. Therefore, the author isn't wrong to feel that way. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
