She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple regarding plans for the evening, specifically involving sex and video games.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The girlfriend initially wanted to not have sex that night to spend time doing other things. The author agreed. Then they discussed activities, and the author wanted to play video games. The girlfriend then offered that if he didn't play games at all (even before she arrived), they could have sex. The author refused to play games before she came over, leading to the girlfriend not wanting to have sex, which upset the author. He feels she's using sex as a power play, while she sees it as an offer.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining tool. He felt that agreeing to not play games before her arrival (which he saw as a minor sacrifice) would allow them to have sex. But he refused because he felt it was unnecessary. The girlfriend then declined the sex, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's saying that the girlfriend is trying to control him by linking sex to his game-playing. But the girlfriend argues it's just an offer. The author claims there's no mutual benefit for her in him not playing games before they hang out, implying it's a one-sided power move.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both parties should feel comfortable expressing their needs without guilt or pressure. The girlfriend's offer could be seen as a way to compromise: she wants intimacy, and he wants to play games. Her condition is that if he gives up games entirely (before and during their time together), then they can have sex. The author feels this is unfair because the time before she arrives is his own.\n\nBut is it a power play? It depends on intent. If the girlfriend is trying to control the author's time outside their shared plans, that might be a boundary issue. However, she could also be expressing her desire for intimacy while negotiating his desires. The line between negotiation and manipulation can be thin here.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014calling it \"fucked up\" and \"power play\"\u2014might be harsh. However, if the girlfriend is making an ultimatum where his personal time before she arrives is a condition for intimacy, that could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, if it's a mutual decision where he's choosing between two options (games or intimacy), then it's a personal choice.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Both parties might not be fully understanding each other's needs. The author might feel his personal time is being encroached upon, while the girlfriend might feel her need for intimacy is being overlooked. The key issue is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a reward or punishment. If she's doing that, it's a power play. If it's a mutual offer, then it's a negotiation.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured. However, the girlfriend might see it as a way to balance their time together. The problem is that the author felt the condition was unnecessary and controlling, leading to the breakdown in their plans.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. Both might have valid points. The author could be wrong in accusing her of a power play without considering her perspective. Conversely, the girlfriend might be wrong in making her needs conditional on his actions outside their shared time.\n\nBut the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The author's refusal to give up his personal time is his right. However, his accusation of a power play could be dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's offer might stem from wanting to prioritize their time together, but setting a condition that affects his personal time could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties have valid points, but the author's reaction might be inconsiderate of her perspective. However, his stance on self-determination is also justified. The answer hinges on whether using conditional intimacy is a legitimate negotiation or a power play. Different people might see it differently. Given the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to adjust their approaches.\n"
