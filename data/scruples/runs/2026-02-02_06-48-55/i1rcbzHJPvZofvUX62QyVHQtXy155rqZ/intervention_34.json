She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is in a relationship where they and their girlfriend usually have sex every time they hang out. The girlfriend asks not to have sex this time to focus on other activities. The author agrees. Then they try to plan their evening. The author suggests playing video games, but the girlfriend wants to do something together. The author wants to play games because they haven't in a while. The girlfriend then offers that if he doesn't play any games at all that day (including before she arrives), they can have sex. The author feels this is using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that the girlfriend is manipulating by withholding sex unless he agrees to not play games even before they meet. The girlfriend sees it as an offer, not a power play. The author argues that there's no benefit to the girlfriend if he stops playing games before they meet, making it a one-sided condition. The girlfriend might think she's being fair, offering an alternative activity if he declines the deal.\n\nIs the author wrong for seeing this as a power play? The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions are manipulative or a reasonable negotiation. If the offer is just a way to have sex but not a coercion, then maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the girlfriend is using the threat of withholding sex to get her way, that's manipulative. \n\nThe author agreed to not play games during their time together, but the girlfriend extended the condition to before they meet. The author feels that this is unreasonable because the games are before they even see each other. The girlfriend might feel she's compromising by allowing the author to play before she arrives, but the author sees it as a trade where he's giving up something (not playing games) in exchange for sex, which benefits only her. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel that their needs are respected. If the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control the other's behavior, that's problematic. The author's frustration seems justified if the girlfriend isn't seeing the imbalance. However, the girlfriend might genuinely see it as a mutually agreeable trade. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for perceiving it as a power play. If the girlfriend's intention was to incentivize the author to give up gaming time for her benefit, then yes, it's a power play. But if it's just a lighthearted offer without coercion, maybe not. The author's reaction (calling it \"fucked up\") might be harsh, but his reasoning is about mutual benefit. Since the offer doesn't benefit the girlfriend in the author's view, it's a one-way trade. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Or is the girlfriend? The situation is a bit ambiguous. If the author is wrong, it's because he's dismissing the girlfriend's perspective and not considering it as a genuine offer. If he's right, then the girlfriend is indeed using manipulation. The answer depends on whether the girlfriend's action was manipulative or a reasonable compromise. Since the author sees it as a power play and the girlfriend doesn't, and both are seeing it differently, the question is whether the author's perspective is valid. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate and respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is using sex to get her way, that's a problem. The author's stance is about respecting his own boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author is being too rigid or not considering the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nI think the key here is the mutual benefit. Since the offer only benefits the girlfriend (sex) and not the author (giving up games), it's a one-sided condition, making it a power play. Therefore, the author is justified in his stance. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
