She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They were trying to plan an evening together. The girlfriend wanted to not have sex that night because they do it often and she wants to do other things. The author agreed and they started planning dinner and activities. The author suggested playing video games, and the girlfriend wanted to do something together instead. The author said he wanted to play games because he hasn't had time lately. Then the girlfriend offered that they could have sex if he didn't play any games that night. The author initially agreed but then realized the girlfriend wanted him to not play games all day, even before she arrived. He pushed back, saying that it's unfair for her to use sex as a power move, and they ended up not speaking and not making plans.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend made a conditional offer: if he doesn't play games all day, they can have sex. The author felt that this was using sex as a power play, especially since the restriction was before she arrived. The girlfriend saw it as an offer, not a power play. \n\nThe author's argument is that the offer isn't beneficial to the girlfriend. He argues that the only benefit to him is having sex, while she doesn't gain anything from him not playing games before she comes. Therefore, it's a power play where she's trying to control him into giving up his own time. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's just making an offer, and he's free to accept or decline. She doesn't see it as a power play. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics and consent, both partners should have autonomy over their time and activities. The girlfriend's condition seems to be a way to encourage the author to not play games during their time together, but extending it to before they meet might be seen as controlling. However, the author is also making a choice whether to accept or reject the condition. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the girlfriend wanted to spend time together without games, maybe she could have just suggested activities that they can do together instead of making it conditional on sex. The author feels that his right to play games before she arrives is being infringed upon without mutual benefit. \n\nPower dynamics in relationships can be tricky. When one partner uses something the other wants (like sex) as a condition for giving up something else (like playing games), it can be seen as a power play if there's no mutual benefit or if it's used to control. However, if both parties are comfortable and it's a mutual agreement, it's not necessarily a problem. \n\nIn this case, the author felt that the offer was one-sided and used to manipulate him into complying. The girlfriend didn't see it that way. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt that his autonomy was being compromised. However, he could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by discussing his feelings without accusing her of a power play. \n\nBut the core issue is whether using sex as a condition for not playing games (especially games he wanted to play) is a power play. If the girlfriend isn't getting any benefit from him not playing games before she arrives, then the author's point about it being a one-sided condition could be valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that she's being fair by offering an alternative (sex) in exchange for his not playing games during their time together. However, extending it to the entire day might not be necessary. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. Both have valid points. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels controlled. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's making an offer. However, the author might be in the right if he's standing up for his boundaries. But if he dismissed her feelings or made her feel attacked, he might share some responsibility. \n\nGiven the information, the author is not in the wrong if he's asserting his right to not be controlled by such conditions. But if he's not considering her perspective or if there's a lack of communication, maybe there's room for both to adjust. However, based on the details provided, the author's stance seems reasonable. So I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
