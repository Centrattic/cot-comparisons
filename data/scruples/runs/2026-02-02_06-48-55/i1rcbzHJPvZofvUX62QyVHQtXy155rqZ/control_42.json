She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend asked if they could skip having sex tonight because they do it often and she wants to just hang out. The author agreed, no problem. Then they tried to plan activities. The author suggested playing video games, and the girlfriend wanted to do something together instead. The author said they wanted to play games because they hadn't in a while. \n\nThen the girlfriend offered that they could have sex if he didn't play any video games tonight. The author agreed but clarified that playing before she arrived was okay. She then changed her mind, saying he couldn't play at all that day. The author got upset, thinking she was using sex as a power play. She didn't see it that way, just as an offer. Now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and mutual respect in the relationship. The girlfriend made a conditional offer: no video games during their time together in exchange for sex. The author felt it was a power play because he wasn't allowed to play even before she arrived. The author's main issue is that the girlfriend is linking sex to his activities, which he sees as manipulative.\n\nBut wait, is it a power play if she's offering sex as an option? If both parties agree to terms, maybe it's consensual. But the author felt it was unfair because the benefit (sex) is one-sided. The girlfriend wanted to have sex, but the author had to give up more (no games all day). The author's argument is that the offer wasn't balanced. However, the girlfriend might see it as a way to negotiate their time together. \n\nThe author's reaction of calling it a power play and being upset might be a bit harsh. The girlfriend did present it as an offer, not a demand. She also accepted when he declined. But the author might be right if the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. However, if both are okay with such negotiations, it's their choice. The problem is the communication breakdown. The author felt disrespected, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the girlfriend made an offer and he had the right to decline, maybe not. But if she's using sex to manipulate his actions, then it's a power play. The author's interpretation is that it's a control tactic, which is valid if that's how he feels. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's a consensual exchange. The answer might depend on whether the negotiation is mutual and consensual. If the author feels pressured or manipulated, that's a concern. But if it's a mutual agreement, maybe not. \n\nGiven that the author's main issue is perceiving it as a power play, and he communicated that, it's a difference in how they view the negotiation. The girlfriend didn't see it as a power play, just an offer. The author might not be in the wrong if he stands by his feelings, but he could also be overreacting. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend made an offer and he declined, leading to a cold war, maybe the author's reaction is justified if he felt it was manipulative. But maybe he's not wrong to set boundaries around how his time is managed. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is using sex as a reward, that's a form of manipulation. But if both are okay with such terms, it's their choice. The author's problem is that the terms were one-sided. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries and feeling that the negotiation was unfair. However, some might argue that she had the right to make the offer, even if he found it manipulative. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
