She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about video game time and sex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked not to have sex that night, which the author was okay with. Then, when discussing plans, she offered sex as a trade for him not playing video games during their evening. The author agreed but later realized she wanted him to not play games at all that day, even before she arrived. He felt this was using sex as a power play because the benefit (sex) only went one way, and she didn't gain anything from him not playing games beforehand. He got upset, called her out on it, and they stopped communicating.\n\nNow, the key points here are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend made a trade that the author didn't feel was balanced. From the author's perspective, he saw it as a power play because his giving up gaming time before their meeting didn't benefit her, only her getting to have sex. However, the girlfriend viewed it as a simple offer without negative intent.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he believes the trade was unfair and manipulative, while the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel that their needs and boundaries are respected. Using sex as a bargaining chip for something that doesn't benefit both sides can be seen as a power move. The author stood up for himself, which is important, but maybe his reaction was a bit harsh. However, his right to feel that way is valid because he didn't want to feel pressured to give up something personal for an unequal exchange.\n\nThe girlfriend's offer might have been well-intentioned, but if it made the author uncomfortable, the problem lies in the lack of mutual understanding. The author isn't wrong for pointing out that the exchange wasn't balanced. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
