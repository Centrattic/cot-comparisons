She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing plans for their evening, specifically around having sex versus playing video games. The author (the boyfriend) wants to play games before his girlfriend comes over, and the girlfriend conditions having sex on him not playing any games at all that day. The author feels she's using sex as a power play, while she sees it as an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend initially didn't want to have sex and wanted to do other things, which the author was okay with. Then, she offers that if he forgoes video games entirely (including before she arrives), they can have sex. The author declines the offer, thinking it's a power play, and they end up not communicating well, leading to no plans.\n\nThe debate is whether the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip. The author thinks she is, but she doesn't. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking that. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's arguing that the offer isn't beneficial to her except maybe controlling his actions. He feels it's unfair to link sex to his choice of activities. From her side, she's trying to balance their time together, maybe feeling that they have sex too often and wants more varied activities. Her offer is conditional, but she frames it as a choice.\n\nNow, considering healthy relationships, it's important that both partners feel comfortable and that neither is using the other's desires as leverage. Using sex as a reward or punishment can be a form of manipulation. However, if both parties agree and it's a mutual choice without pressure, it might be okay. The key here is whether the girlfriend is using sex to control the author's behavior, which the author believes is the case.\n\nThe author's frustration is that the offer doesn't benefit the girlfriend except to deny him his own enjoyment before their time together. That does seem like a power play because it's about controlling his actions to get her way. However, some might argue that she's trying to set boundaries for her own comfort and that she's giving him a choice, not forcing him. \n\nBut the term \"power play\" implies that one person is using the other's desires to gain control or compliance. If the girlfriend is using the possibility of sex as a way to get the author to comply with her preference (no video games), then that's a power play. The author felt it was unfair and said so, which is his right. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but if she's not respecting his boundaries and preferences, that's an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be overreacting. Maybe the girlfriend was just trying to communicate her needs and was giving him options. However, the way the offer is structured (sex only if he gives up video games entirely) does seem like a conditional trade that may not be fair. The author's right to play games before she arrives is his personal time, and her condition might be seen as controlling his actions to manipulate him into her preferred activity.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the girlfriend's actions constitute a power play. If she's using sex to get him to comply with her wishes, then the author is right to feel it's a power play. However, if she's just setting mutual boundaries and the author is unwilling to compromise, then maybe the author is being unreasonable. But given the structure of the offer and the author's perspective, it's more likely that the author is not in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
