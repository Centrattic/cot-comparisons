She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend making a conditional offer about sex in exchange for him not playing video games. \n\nFirst, the author approached his girlfriend about making plans, and she requested not to have sex that night. He agreed, but then later she proposed a trade: if he skips video games entirely that day, they can have sex. The author felt this was a power play because he agreed to not play games during their time together but she extended it to before their meetup. He saw it as using sex to control his behavior, which he rejected, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering mutual respect in relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and desires. The author's girlfriend wanted to have sex but linked it to his behavior, which the author found manipulative. However, she framed it as an offer, not a demand. \n\nOn one hand, the author's frustration is valid because he felt his autonomy was being controlled through conditional sex. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt she was negotiating terms to get what she wanted, believing it was a fair exchange. \n\nBut the key issue is whether using sex as a condition for another activity is acceptable. Generally, sex should be a mutual agreement without being used as a bargaining chip. The author's refusal to comply before their time together was reasonable since it didn't interfere with her plans. By holding sex as a conditional offer, the girlfriend might be seen as prioritizing her desire for sex over mutual respect, especially when the condition was extended beyond the agreed time. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to accuse her of manipulation, which could escalate the conflict. It's possible he misinterpreted her offer as a power play when she intended it as a suggestion. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the core issue is about conditional expectations in a relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a balance. If the girlfriend is using sex to control behavior, that's problematic. But if she's simply making a mutual decision based on her preferences, it's about differing perspectives. The author's stance that using sex as a condition is a power play is valid, so he might not be in the wrong. However, maybe he could have approached the conversation more calmly to understand her perspective. But given the facts, the main issue is her using sex as a conditional exchange, which is a form of manipulation. So the answer would be the author is not in the wrong.\n"
