She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about having sex versus playing video games.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initially declines sex and wants to spend time doing other things. The author agrees and suggests games. Then, when he wants to play, she offers that they can have sex if he doesn't play games at all that day, not just during their time together. The author feels this is a power play because not playing games before they meet doesn't benefit her, but she's using it as a condition for sex.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual respect. The author feels like the girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip to control his behavior. The girlfriend sees it as an offer. The author is upset because he thinks the condition is unfair. \n\nFrom a relational perspective, using sex as a conditional exchange where one party feels pressured might be seen as manipulative. However, if both parties are in agreement and it's a mutual decision, it's a different story. But in this case, the author didn't want to give up playing before their meet-up, and the girlfriend refused to compromise. The author's frustration is about being forced to choose between an activity he wanted and the possibility of sex, which he finds controlling.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that it's an offer, not a demand. However, the fact that she's making the offer conditional on his complete abstinence from gaming (even before their time together) might not be a balanced exchange. The author's point is valid in that there's no benefit for her in him not gaming beforehand, making it a one-sided condition. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both parties should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using ultimatums or conditions that don't serve mutual benefit. The author's reaction, while heated, points out a potential power imbalance where sex is used as a reward or punishment. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that the girlfriend's request stems from feeling that their time together is more important than his gaming. If she genuinely wanted to prioritize their time without distractions, she might have communicated that differently. The way she set the condition could be seen as a power play, especially if it's a recurring issue. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling that his boundaries were disrespected. If the girlfriend had offered a compromise, like not gaming during their time together but allowing it before, that would be more balanced. By extending the condition to all day, she's imposing a restriction that doesn't align with the mutual benefit. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics of the situation and the principles of healthy communication, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions could be seen as using sex to control the situation, which is a form of power play, and the author is justified in his feelings.\n"
