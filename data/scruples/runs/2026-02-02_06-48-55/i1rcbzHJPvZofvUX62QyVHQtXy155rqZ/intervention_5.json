She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is at fault here. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend discussing plans for the evening. The girlfriend initially wants to skip sex to spend time together, and the author agrees. Later, when suggesting video games, the girlfriend offers sex in exchange for the author not playing games at all that day, not just during their time together. The author feels this is using sex as a power play and gets upset, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thinks the girlfriend is using sex to control the situation. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's making an offer, and the author is free to accept or decline. The key point here is whether the girlfriend's offer is a power play or a genuine proposal. A power play implies using something (like sex) to manipulate or control the other person's behavior, expecting compliance for the sake of the offer.\n\nThe girlfriend asked the author not to play games during their time together, which he agreed to. She then offers to have sex if he avoids games entirely that day. The author feels this is unreasonable because he wants to play before she arrives. The girlfriend's offer extends beyond their time together, which the author sees as an overreach. \n\nFrom a relationship dynamics standpoint, using conditional offers around intimacy can be seen as problematic because it may imply that one's worth or the relationship's value is tied to meeting certain conditions. However, if both parties are comfortable with such negotiations, it might be consensual. But the author's issue is not with the offer itself but with the perceived manipulation.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he feels his autonomy is being challenged. However, he could have approached the situation with more empathy, understanding that his girlfriend might have different needs or wants for intimacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend's condition might be a way to express her desire for closeness, but framing it as a trade-off could be the issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author's initial reaction is to label it a power play, which could be a knee-jerk response. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings without attacking her intentions. However, the girlfriend's conditional offer might not be inherently wrong if both are okay with it, but the author's discomfort is a valid reason to not proceed. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on communication styles. The author could be at fault for accusing her of manipulation without fully understanding her perspective, but she might also be using sex as leverage, which the author rightly feels uncomfortable with. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his boundaries, which is healthy. However, the situation is complex, and both could have approached it better.\n"
