She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend using sex as a power play. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend are trying to plan their evening. She wants to avoid sex tonight because they do it often and she just wants to chill. He agrees and suggests playing video games. She then offers that if he doesn't play games at all (even before she arrives), they can have sex. He feels this is a power play because he's willing to play before she gets there, but she insists on no games all day. When he refuses, she refuses to have sex, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe author's perspective is that she's using sex as leverage, which he finds unacceptable. She, however, sees it as an offer and a difference in opinion. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, mutual respect, and communication. Using sex as a reward or punishment can be seen as manipulative if it's not a mutual agreement. The girlfriend's offer might be her way of negotiating, but the author feels it's controlling. The key points: does the author have the right to refuse, and is he overstepping by labeling it a power play?\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs without coercion. If the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional exchange, that could be problematic. However, if she's just presenting an option and he's choosing not to accept the terms, he's within his rights to decline. The author might be right in feeling that the terms are unfair, especially since the condition (no games before she arrives) doesn't benefit her but restricts him. She might not realize how her actions are perceived. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction of calling it a power play and getting upset might have been harsh. Communication is key here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries and refusing to comply with what he sees as an unfair exchange. The girlfriend's approach might be flawed, but the author's response could also be improved. However, the main issue is whether using sex as a conditional offer is wrong. In many perspectives, that's a red flag. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
