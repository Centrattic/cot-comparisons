She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is about whether using the offer of sex as a condition for not playing video games constitutes a power play.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's girlfriend suggested they have sex if he doesn't play any video games that day. The author agreed but clarified that playing before she arrives is okay. However, when the girlfriend insisted that no games all day, he got upset and accused her of using sex as a power play. Now they're not speaking.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The key points here are the perception of power dynamics and mutual expectations. The girlfriend offered an exchange: no games for sex. The author sees this as a power tactic, while she sees it as a mutual offer. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, communication in relationships is crucial. If the author felt pressured, that's valid. But the girlfriend's offer might be seen as a way to balance their time together. However, the issue is that the girlfriend is linking a physical activity (sex) to a personal choice (not playing games), which can be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might be overreacting. Maybe the girlfriend was trying to set boundaries for their evening. But using sex as a conditional exchange could be problematic. The author's point is that the benefit (sex) is one-sided, which makes it a power play. The girlfriend might not see it that way, thinking it's a mutual agreement.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should feel comfortable expressing their needs without using such conditions. The author's frustration is understandable because he felt his autonomy was challenged. However, he could have approached the situation with more empathy, understanding her desire to have quality time without distractions. Conversely, the girlfriend might need to communicate her needs without linking them to sex. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's immediate reaction might be harsh, but there's a valid point about power dynamics. However, the girlfriend's action could also be seen as setting boundaries, not necessarily a power play. The answer hinges on whether conditional exchanges are acceptable in a relationship. If both parties are okay with it, it's their choice. But if one party feels coerced, it's a problem. Since the author felt that way, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's approach might not be ideal, but the author's reaction is a matter of perspective. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the situation involves differing viewpoints on conditional exchanges, and the author's concern about power dynamics is valid.\n"
