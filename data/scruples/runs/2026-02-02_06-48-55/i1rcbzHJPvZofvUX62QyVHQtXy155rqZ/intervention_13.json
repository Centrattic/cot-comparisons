She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about plans for the evening, specifically regarding video games and sex.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to plan a night where they could hang out without having sex every time. He agreed to skip sex that night if they could play video games. His girlfriend then offered that if he didn't play any video games at all that day (including before she arrived), they could have sex. The author felt this was using sex as a power play because he thought it was unreasonable to give up playing games before they met, especially since she didn't get any benefit from that condition. He got upset and accused her of trying to control him, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that his girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip by linking it to his activity before their meeting. He sees it as a power play where she's trying to get him to concede. On the other hand, his girlfriend might feel that she's making a fair offer: if he's willing to forgo games during their time together, then they can have sex. She might not see it as a power play but as a mutual agreement where both sides are giving up something (he gives up games during their time, she gives up sex if he does play during their time).\n\nThe key issue here is consent and mutual respect. If both parties are comfortable with the terms of their agreement, then it's a matter of negotiation. However, the author feels that the terms are unfair because he's asked to give up something (games before they meet) that doesn't benefit her, making it a one-sided power move. His girlfriend, however, might argue that it's a reasonable condition for her to have sex, and she's within her rights to set boundaries.\n\nIt's important to consider whether using sex as a condition for other activities is inherently problematic. Some people might see it as a natural part of a relationship where both partners negotiate their needs and boundaries. Others might view it as a form of manipulation if one party feels pressured. The author's frustration comes from feeling that his needs (to play games) are being overshadowed by his girlfriend's conditions, even if the conditions are about activities that happen before their time together.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the condition and calling it a power play. From a communication standpoint, both parties might have misinterpreted each other's intentions. The author could have approached the situation with more understanding, recognizing that his girlfriend might be setting her own terms for intimacy. Conversely, she might need to acknowledge that his need to play games before their meeting is valid and that linking it to their sexual activity could be seen as a form of control.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear answer. It's a matter of differing perspectives on what constitutes healthy negotiation in a relationship. However, the author's reaction of calling it a power play and getting upset might have been overreacting if he hasn't considered that his girlfriend's condition is her way of setting boundaries for her own comfort. On the flip side, if she consistently uses such conditions in the relationship, it could indicate a pattern of using intimacy as leverage.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's interpretation of a power play is valid. If his girlfriend's condition is a one-time request without prior patterns of manipulation, he might not be in the wrong. But if his reaction stems from a lack of communication or misunderstanding, then he might be contributing to the conflict. The situation seems more like a difference in negotiation styles rather than a clear-cut case of right or wrong.\n"
