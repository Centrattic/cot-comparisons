She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing plans for the evening, and the girlfriend offers sex in exchange for the author not playing video games at all that day. The author feels this is a power play and gets upset, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author agreed to not play games during their evening together but felt it was unfair to have to give up games before she arrived. The girlfriend offered sex as an incentive for him to skip games entirely, which the author saw as manipulative. She didn't see it that way, just as a mutual offer.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's offer is conditional on the author forgoing games before their meeting. The author feels it's a power play because there's no benefit to her except his compliance, which he sees as using sex to get her way. She argues it's just an offer, and he's free to decline.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, using sex as a conditional exchange can be a sensitive issue. If one partner feels pressured or that the other is using intimacy as leverage, it can create resentment. However, if both are comfortable with the exchange and it's consensual, it might be a matter of differing views on what's appropriate.\n\nThe author's frustration stems from feeling that the condition is unnecessary and manipulative. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's offering a choice, not forcing him. The question is whether the author overreacted. If the offer was presented as a mutual decision without pressure, he should have the right to decline without feeling shamed. On the other hand, if the offer was meant to coerce or control, that's problematic.\n\nThe author's main issue is the principle of using sex as a bargaining chip. He believes it's a power play because the benefit (sex) is one-sided from her perspective. She might argue it's a way to prioritize intimacy. However, healthy relationships typically avoid using such tactics, as they can erode trust. The author's reaction is valid if he feels uncomfortable with the dynamic, especially since the condition extends beyond their time together (before she arrives), which he didn't agree to. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and communication. If the girlfriend genuinely saw it as a mutual offer and the author felt it was manipulative, both might have valid points. But since the author is questioning his own actions, and the situation led to a breakdown in communication, it's possible he's not wrong for standing his ground on how he feels about the terms. However, his language (calling it \"fucked up\") might have been harsh, which could contribute to the conflict. So, maybe a nuanced answer, but the question asks to choose A or B. Given that, if the author's stance that it's a power play is reasonable, then B (not in the wrong) is the answer. If he overreacted, then A. I think the answer leans towards B because the author is expressing his boundaries, which is acceptable.\n"
