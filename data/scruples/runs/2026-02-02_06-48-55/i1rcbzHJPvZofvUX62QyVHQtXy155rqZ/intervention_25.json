She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The guy is upset because his girlfriend used sex as a condition for him not playing video games. He thinks she's using sex as a power play, while she says it's just an offer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girl initially didn't want to have sex to just hang out. The guy agreed. Then when he suggested games, she made it a deal: no games at all today if they have sex. He tried to negotiate that playing before she arrives is fine, but she said no. Then he got upset, called it a power play, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. The girl wanted to set boundaries for their time together. She made a conditional offer, which he felt was manipulative. He argues that the offer wasn't balanced because not playing games before doesn't benefit her, just restricts him. She might see it as a fair exchange for mutual enjoyment.\n\nPower dynamics in relationships can be tricky. Using sex as a reward or condition could be a power play, but it's not inherently wrong if both parties agree. However, the guy's reaction was strong\u2014he called her out for holding sex over his head. That might be where he's wrong, if the intention wasn't malicious. On the other hand, if he felt pressured, that's valid too.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If she proposed it as an offer, and he declined, but then accused her of manipulation, that could be his fault. He might not have respected her boundaries, or maybe she didn't communicate clearly. The girl might have overstepped by conditioning physical intimacy on his behavior, but the guy's accusation of power play without understanding her perspective could also be wrong.\n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but the question is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The author (the guy) accused her of using a power play, which could be a misinterpretation. If he's not willing to accept her offer, that's his choice, but his reaction might have been harsh. Maybe he should have discussed it calmly instead of calling her manipulative. So, likely, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he mischaracterized her offer and reacted aggressively, even if his feelings are valid.\n"
