She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend about plans for the night.\n\nSo, the author wanted to play video games, and the girlfriend suggested they not have sex if he plays games. The author feels she's using sex as a power play. He agrees to not play during their evening together, but she insists he can't play at all that day. He gets upset and accuses her of holding sex over his head. They end up not talking and nothing happens that night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is frustrated because he thought agreeing to not play during their time together was enough. The girlfriend wanted him to give up gaming entirely that day to get sex. He sees it as a power play where she's using sex as a reward. She claims it's just an offer, not a power play.\n\nPower play in relationships usually involves using some form of control or manipulation to get what one wants. If she's using sex as a conditional reward for him not gaming all day, that could be seen as manipulative. The author's point is that there's no benefit to her if he doesn't game before their time together, so it's one-sided. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's intention was different. She might have felt that if he's preoccupied with games even before their time, he's not fully present. However, the author already agreed to not play during their evening, so the pre-gaming might not affect their time together. \n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's condition is a legitimate expression of her needs or a manipulative tactic. The author feels it's the latter, and she doesn't see it that way. Both are entitled to their feelings, but the author's reaction is about setting boundaries around what's acceptable to him.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, the author isn't wrong in asserting his boundaries. Using sex as a condition for other activities can be problematic if it's used to control the other person's behavior. The author's frustration is valid because he's pushing back against what he perceives as unfair conditional terms. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs and boundaries, especially when he feels manipulated.\n"
