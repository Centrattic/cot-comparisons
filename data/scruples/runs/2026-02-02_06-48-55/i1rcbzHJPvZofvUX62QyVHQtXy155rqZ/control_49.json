She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked to not have sex because she wants to chill and do other things. The author agreed, no problem. Then they discussed plans for the evening. The author suggested playing video games, which the girlfriend wanted to do something together. The author mentioned they wanted to play games because they hadn't in a while. The girlfriend then said they could have sex if he didn't play games at all that day. The author felt this was using sex as a power play and got upset. The girlfriend says it was just an offer, and they aren't speaking now.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The author agreed to not have sex that night, then the girlfriend offered to have sex if he didn't play games. The author felt it was a power play because he thought the only benefit for her was getting him to not play games, which she didn't gain from him playing before. The girlfriend says it's an offer, both sides get something. But the author feels it's manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author's issue is that the girlfriend is using sex as a conditional for his activities. Even if she presented it as an offer, if the author perceives it as a power play, there's a conflict. But is that justified? Let's see. The author was okay with not having sex that night but later got upset when she tied sex to his game time. The problem is whether the girlfriend's offer is a legitimate exchange or manipulation. The author might be right in feeling it's a power play because the benefit for her is just that he doesn't game during their time together, and she's using sex as a reward. However, she might see it as a way to spend more quality time together instead of him being distracted by games. But the author's point is that she's trying to control his behavior through sex, which is a form of manipulation. \n\nThe author's reaction might be over the top, but his reasoning is valid. The girlfriend's approach might not be a power play in her eyes, but the author's boundary is being respected. If the author feels it's manipulative, and the girlfriend doesn't acknowledge that, maybe the issue is mutual misunderstanding. However, the key is whether the author is wrong for thinking that way. Since power dynamics in relationships can be subjective, but the author's perspective is that he didn't want to give up his games before meeting her, and she's holding sex over his head to get what she wants. In that case, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. The girlfriend's offer could be seen as a trade, but if the author doesn't want to make that trade, he's within his rights to decline. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
