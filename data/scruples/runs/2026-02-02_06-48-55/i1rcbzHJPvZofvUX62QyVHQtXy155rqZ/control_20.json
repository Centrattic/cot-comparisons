She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants to not have sex tonight and instead just hang out. The author agreed, but then the girlfriend offered that if he doesn't play video games during their evening, they can have sex. The author felt like she's using sex as a power play because she's linking it to his gaming. He refused, and now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The girlfriend initially wanted to skip sex and just hang out, and the author was okay with that. Then she offers an alternative where he gives up gaming for the evening to get sex. The author objects to this, thinking it's a power play because he's not getting a real benefit, just giving up something for her to get sex. The girlfriend says it's just an offer and a difference in opinion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend made an offer that the author found manipulative. But maybe she didn't mean it that way. The key here is whether using sex as an incentive for giving up an activity is a power play. The author feels it's one-sided; he's giving up gaming (even before their time together) for her benefit. But the girlfriend might see it as a mutual decision, where she's offering something she's willing to do if he complies with her wish to not play during their time together. \n\nBut the author's main issue is that she's linking sex to his activities, which he doesn't feel should be connected. The girlfriend's offer might be a form of negotiation, but the author sees it as manipulation. It's possible that both have valid points. However, the author's reaction was to accuse her of using sex as a power play, which could come off as dismissive of her perspective. On the other hand, if he's right that the offer is unfair, then his reaction is justified.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The girlfriend might be trying to balance her own desires (to have sex sometimes vs. other times just hanging out) and the author's desire to game. But the offer's terms might be too much for him. The problem is the framing: if the offer is conditional on giving up an activity before their time together, maybe it's a bit much. The author's frustration is valid if he feels pressured to trade something personal for intimacy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't agree to the terms and expressed his feelings, which is reasonable. The girlfriend might not have meant to manipulate but rather to negotiate, but the author's perspective is valid in that he feels it's a power play. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he's standing up for his boundaries, the answer is likely B (No). The issue is mutual misunderstanding rather than one person being at fault.\n"
