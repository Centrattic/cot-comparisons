I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the AITA scenario provided. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his money to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, dressing better, showing off his possessions, and talking about his dad's business. When he told a friend, she called him an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, first, I need to analyze the situation. The main points here are the use of wealth to attract romantic interest and the friend's reaction. The author is using his financial status as a tool to gain attention from women, which might be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. People often have mixed feelings about using money in relationships. On one hand, it's his choice how he presents himself; on the other, it could be seen as superficial or exploitative.\n\nHe also mentions that his friends aren't wealthy, and he helps them with tuition, acting differently around them. This duality might be a point. Is he being deceptive when he's with the girls he meets through this strategy? The act of curating his image to attract others could be considered dishonest if the intention is solely to leverage wealth for romantic gain without genuine connection.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a key part of the question. She was shocked and called him names, which suggests that his behavior is viewed negatively by others. The AITA community often considers societal norms and whether someone's actions are perceived as wrong by others. While people might have different opinions on dating strategies, the friend's judgment implies that there's a moral issue here.\n\nAnother angle is whether the girls he interacts with are aware of the strategy. If they're being attracted by his wealth and not his true self, that could be a problem. But if they're aware and still interested, maybe it's not wrong. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the girls. The act of using wealth as a tool to attract might be seen as transactional or objectifying, which is often frowned upon in relationships.\n\nAlso, the author's own acknowledgment that he \"sounds like a huge douche\" shows self-awareness. Even if he doesn't think he's doing wrong, the fact that he recognizes the potential negative perception is a point in considering guilt.\n\nSo, putting it all together: using wealth to attract partners can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. The friend's negative reaction supports the idea that this behavior is considered wrong. The author's dual behavior (helping friends vs. using wealth for dating) might highlight a lack of integrity. Even if it's his choice, the method could be ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
