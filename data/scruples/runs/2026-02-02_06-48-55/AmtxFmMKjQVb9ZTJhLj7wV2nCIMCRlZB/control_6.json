I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who uses social media to show off his wealth to get attention. He mentions that he's not good-looking and it's hard for him to get dates otherwise. He changed his strategy by posting his expensive stuff, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He also helps his friends with tuition but pretends to be a regular guy when hanging out with them. When he told a friend about his tactics, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is using his wealth to attract attention, which could be seen as inauthentic. He's presenting a different persona online compared to his real self. However, he's upfront with his friends about this when he tells them. But the issue might be that he's being deceptive with the girls he's trying to date. If he's not being genuine and is using material things to attract them, that could be manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his personal life and he's not hurting anyone if the girls are attracted to him because of his wealth. However, the problem arises if he's not honest about his intentions or his lifestyle. The fact that he's helping his friends financially but hides his wealth from them when not with them might indicate a lack of authenticity.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that she found the behavior inconsiderate or unethical. The author is using his resources to gain social advantages, which could be seen as exploiting his wealth in a way that's not fair. But is it the author's fault if he's just trying to navigate dating in a society where wealth can influence attraction? \n\nI need to weigh the manipulation aspect against personal choice. If he's not lying directly but is being strategic with how he presents himself, maybe it's not entirely wrong. However, if he's leading others on by pretending to be someone he's not, that's more problematic. The key here is whether the girls he's interested in are aware of his true intentions and his wealth. If they're being attracted by his posts and he's using that to his advantage without being honest, then it's deceptive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is being inauthentic and possibly deceptive in his dating approach, which can be seen as wrong because it's not genuine. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
