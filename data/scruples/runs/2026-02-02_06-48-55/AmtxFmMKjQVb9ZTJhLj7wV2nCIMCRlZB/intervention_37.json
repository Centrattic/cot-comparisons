I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 22-year-old wealthy individual using their money and social media to attract girls. They post about their condo, cars, trips, etc., to gain attention. They admit it's just to get girls and that they act differently around their non-wealthy friends. The friend called them an asshole after finding out.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using money to attract others isn't inherently wrong, but the question is about manipulation and honesty. The author is being upfront with the girls about their wealth and lifestyle, maybe not explicitly about their motives, but they're not lying about their status. However, if they're pretending to be someone they're not just to get into relationships, that's a problem. Also, they're being hypocritical by helping friends financially but using their wealth to gain attention. The friend's reaction suggests that their actions are seen as inauthentic or using others for their status. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're being deceitful and manipulative in their approach to relationships, even if they're not lying outright. They're exploiting their wealth to get what they want without genuine connection. So the answer might be A.\n"
