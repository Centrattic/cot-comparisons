I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and has trouble getting dates. He started posting luxury items on Instagram and got a lot of DMs from girls. He uses his wealth to impress them, talks about his dad's business, etc. But when he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author is being honest about his approach and isn't necessarily lying; he is who he is. Using social media to showcase his lifestyle is his way of attracting attention. However, the issue might be more about the intention and how it's perceived. The author is using his wealth as a tool for social validation, which some might see as inauthentic or manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has different ways to attract people they're interested in. The author isn't actively harming anyone, just being strategic. He's also helping his friends by paying their tuition, so he's not entirely selfish. But the friend's reaction suggests that the strategy is seen as inconsiderate or shallow. \n\nAnother angle: is it fair to judge someone for using their resources to improve their social life? The author isn't coercing anyone; the girls are the ones initiating DMs. But maybe the problem is the perception of using money as a substitute for genuine connection. The author might be viewed as insincere, which could lead to shallow relationships. \n\nAlso, the line between confidence and arrogance can be thin. While the author is confident in his financial status, it might come off as arrogant to others. The friend's reaction highlights that the strategy is off-putting to some. \n\nIn summary, opinions might be split. Some might say it's a personal choice and not the author's fault, while others see it as inauthentic and manipulative. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not breaking any laws or directly harming others, but is using a strategy that some find objectionable, it's a matter of social judgment. The answer A (yes) or B (no) depends on whether one prioritizes personal freedom over social norms.\n"
