I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that the author, a 22-year-old with a trust fund, uses social media to showcase their wealth to get attention from women. They admit to being not good-looking and struggling otherwise. They also mention helping friends pay for tuition and acting differently around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using money to attract people can be seen as manipulative or insincere. The author isn't being honest about their intentions initially, which might be deceptive. However, they do mention that they are a different person with their friends, which suggests they aren't entirely inauthentic in all aspects of their life.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called the author an asshole or a douche, which indicates that others see the behavior as inconsiderate or shallow. The key point here is whether the author's actions are inherently wrong. While it's their choice how to approach dating, using wealth to gain attention might be perceived as exploiting their financial status, which could be seen as unethical by some standards.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's their personal strategy and not illegal or harmful. However, the question is about being in the wrong socially or morally. The author's actions could be considered superficial and possibly disrespectful to the women who might be interested solely for material reasons. The fact that they admit to doing this just to get with girls shows a lack of authenticity, which could be a moral issue.\n\nAlso, the author's friends are not wealthy, so there's a contrast in how they present themselves to different groups. This duality might indicate a lack of integrity in their social interactions. The friend's shock and negative reaction support the idea that this behavior is socially frowned upon.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, their actions are ethically questionable. They're using materialism to manipulate their dating life, which many would consider inauthentic and potentially hurtful. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong.\n"
