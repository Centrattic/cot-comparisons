I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund, which isn't something they can control. They're not good-looking, which might make social interactions harder for them. They started using social media to showcase their wealth\u2014condo, cars, trips\u2014leading to increased attention from girls. They admit to only doing this to get with girls, changing their behavior to fit what they think is attractive. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is using wealth to attract others inherently wrong? People often use different strategies to gain attention, whether it's through wealth, looks, or other means. But the author is being honest when they say they're doing it for that specific reason. However, when they told a friend, she was shocked and called them an asshole. That's a red flag because it indicates that the friend didn't approve, which might mean the author's actions are seen as manipulative or insincere.\n\nThe author also helps friends pay for tuition and changes their behavior around them, showing they can be genuine in some contexts. But the problem arises when they use their wealth as a tool to manipulate social interactions. The question is whether using wealth to attract romantic interest is unethical. Some might argue it's just a game, but others see it as disingenuous. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's approach is viewed negatively by others, which could mean they're in the wrong. Also, if the author is only interested in girls for their looks and using material things to attract them, it could be seen as objectifying others, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't using money to bribe or buy relationships outright. They're showcasing their lifestyle to attract attention, which is a common strategy in dating. However, the insincerity might be the issue. If the girls are drawn in by the wealth and not the person, and the author's main goal is to get with them, it's a form of manipulation. The line between strategy and manipulation can be blurry. The fact that the author admits to changing their behavior for this purpose and that a friend disapproved might tip the balance towards being in the wrong. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
