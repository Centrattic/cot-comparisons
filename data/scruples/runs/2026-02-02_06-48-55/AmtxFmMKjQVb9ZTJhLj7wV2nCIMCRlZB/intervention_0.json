I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family is using his money and status to attract women by showcasing his wealth on social media and in person. He's being upfront with his friends about this tactic, and one friend called him an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man is using his financial status to attract women, which is a common criticism in dating contexts. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong. \n\nSo, let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the man isn't explicitly lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. He's being honest with his friends, even if they disapprove. However, he's using money as a primary tool to attract women, which can be seen as superficial or manipulative. It might be considered disrespectful to women if he's only interested in their attention because of his wealth rather than forming genuine connections.\n\nOn the other hand, people often use their assets\u2014whether wealth, looks, or other traits\u2014to attract others. As long as he's not lying or being deceptive, some might argue it's not unethical. The fact that he's helping his friends financially and acts differently around them suggests he's not a bad person overall, but his approach to dating could be problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, implying that his actions are socially unacceptable. The AITA community often considers societal norms and whether someone's actions are genuinely harmful. If the man's behavior is making women feel objectified or if he's exploiting his wealth to gain attention without any intention of building real relationships, that's a negative aspect.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't mention if the women he dates are aware of his motives or if they're okay with it. If they're consenting adults and he's not harming anyone, some might say it's their choice. But the fact that he's \"only do[ing] this to get with girls\" suggests a lack of genuine interest in forming meaningful connections, which could be seen as using people for his gain.\n\nIn terms of ethics, using wealth to attract partners isn't inherently wrong, but doing so with the sole purpose of manipulation or without regard for others' feelings can cross into unethical territory. The author's approach seems calculated and possibly insincere, which could be considered in the wrong. Also, the friend's disapproval and the author's own acknowledgment that he sounds like a \"huge douche\" indicate that the behavior is viewed negatively by others and possibly by himself, which might imply that it's not acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's using his wealth in a way that's manipulative and lacks genuine intent, even if he's honest about it. The key issue is the intent and the potential for objectification of the women he's attracting.\n"
