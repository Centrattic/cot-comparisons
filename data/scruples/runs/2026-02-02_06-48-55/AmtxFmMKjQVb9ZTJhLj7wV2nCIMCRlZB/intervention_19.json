I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy background. He mentions that he's not good-looking and has struggled to attract girls. His new approach involves showcasing his wealth through social media posts about his condo, cars, trips, etc. This has led to an increase in followers and DMs from attractive women. He also mentions dressing better, driving his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. However, he claims he's a different person with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and acting normally. The friend found out about his strategy and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which can be seen as manipulative. He's being inauthentic in these interactions, presenting a version of himself that's solely for the purpose of getting attention. This could be considered deceptive because he's not being genuine about his intentions or his true self in those situations. \n\nOn the other hand, the author does mention that he's a different person with his friends, which suggests that his behavior isn't his true character in all contexts. However, the fact that he manipulates his image specifically for dating purposes raises ethical concerns. Women who are attracted to him through this strategy might not be interested in a genuine connection but rather his wealth, which could lead to superficial relationships. \n\nThe friend's reaction also indicates that the author's actions are viewed negatively by others. The friend labeled him an asshole, implying that the strategy goes against social norms or expectations of honesty in relationships. The author's approach could be seen as exploiting his wealth to gain attention, which might be considered unethical because it's not based on mutual respect or genuine interest in others.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind his actions. He explicitly states that he's using this tactic \"only to get with girls,\" which suggests a lack of sincerity in his interactions. This could lead to women feeling used or misled if they discover his true motives. Even if the author isn't malicious, the method itself is manipulative, which can harm potential relationships by building them on a false foundation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that everyone uses certain strategies to attract partners, like dressing well or talking about their achievements. But the key difference here is the deliberate and excessive use of wealth as the primary tool, along with the admission that it's inauthentic. This goes beyond normal self-presentation and into manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions involve using wealth deceptively to attract women, which is manipulative and inauthentic. This behavior is likely to be seen as unethical and inconsiderate, making the author at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
