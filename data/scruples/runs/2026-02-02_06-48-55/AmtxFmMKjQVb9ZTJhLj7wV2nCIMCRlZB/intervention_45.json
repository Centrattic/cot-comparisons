I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's using his money and status to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He mentions that he started doing this because he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get with girls otherwise. He's dressing better, showing off his nicer car, talking about his dad's business, and going to trendy places. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole for using money to get girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract partners is a common criticism. It can be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The author is essentially leveraging his family's money to compensate for his perceived lack of other qualities. That could be viewed as shallow or insincere. \n\nBut wait, does that automatically make him wrong? People have different motivations in relationships. Some might prioritize financial security, others looks, or personality. The author isn't physically abusive or cheating; he's just using his resources to improve his chances. However, the method involves deception because he's presenting himself as something he's not in order to attract others. When he's with friends, he's more laid-back, but with girls, he's putting on a show. That duality might be problematic because he's leading women to believe he's a different person than he actually is.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. She was shocked and called him an asshole. That suggests that even people close to him see the strategy as unethical. His justification is that he's helping friends with tuition, showing he's not entirely self-serving, but the main issue is how he's using his wealth in relationships.\n\nAnother angle is whether this is a personal choice. If the women are attracted to his wealth and he's honest about it, maybe it's their choice to be in a relationship with him. However, the problem arises if he's being deceptive. If he's pretending to be someone else to get into relationships, that's a form of manipulation. But if he's upfront about his intentions from the start, it's different. The scenario doesn't specify if he's honest with the women he's dating. If he's leading them on thinking he's an average guy when he's actually using his wealth to attract them, that's dishonest.\n\nAdditionally, the author's own feelings about this matter. He says he's a \"different person\" when with friends, implying that his actions towards women are a facade. This inauthenticity in relationships can lead to issues later on, like trust problems or lack of genuine connection.\n\nConsidering all these points, the consensus is that using wealth to attract partners can be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, especially if it involves deception. Even though it's a personal strategy, it's widely viewed as unethical because it prioritizes materialism over genuine connection and can be exploitative. The friend's negative reaction supports this view. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
