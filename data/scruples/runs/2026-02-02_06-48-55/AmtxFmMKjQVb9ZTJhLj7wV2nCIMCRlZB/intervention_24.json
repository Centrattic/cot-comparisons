I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a wealthy man who uses his money to post on social media, show off his possessions, and dress nicely to get attention from women. He's also being a different person in social settings, using his wealth to impress, but is more normal with friends.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. Using money to attract attention isn't inherently wrong, but the intention behind it matters. He's being deceptive by curating an image that's not authentic in the context where he meets these girls. That could be seen as manipulative. People generally value honesty in relationships; if his wealth is a central part of how he's getting attention, and he's not being upfront about his motives, that's problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of his actions affecting others. His friend called him an asshole, which indicates that his behavior is viewed negatively by those close to him. Even if he's generous with friends, if he's being inauthentic and using his wealth to manipulate situations for personal gain (romantic in this case), it's a form of exploitation. It's not just about the act itself but how it reflects on his character and the respect he shows others.\n\nAnother point is that while he's helping friends financially, that's a separate issue. Being helpful doesn't negate the potential insensitivity in his romantic approach. The key here is authenticity and respect. If he's presenting a false image to manipulate others into being interested, that's a breach of trust and respect. People deserve to be attracted to the real person, not a curated version designed to impress.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's aware he sounds like a douche but continues anyway shows a lack of self-awareness and consideration for others' feelings. His justification that he's \"only doing this to get with girls\" implies that he's prioritizing his desires over ethical considerations. The friend's reaction supports the idea that his actions are seen as inconsiderate and possibly arrogant.\n\nIn conclusion, while the act of using money isn't illegal or against social norms per se, the deception and manipulation involved make it ethically questionable. The author is in the wrong because he's being inauthentic and potentially exploiting others' desires or perceptions for his own benefit without regard for their feelings or the integrity of genuine interactions.\n"
