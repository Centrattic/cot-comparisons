I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, etc. on Instagram. He says he only does this to get with girls and acts normally around his friends, even helping them pay tuition. After telling a friend his method, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his wealth as a tool for attracting romantic partners. Is that inherently wrong? People date for various reasons, including status or wealth. However, if someone is explicitly using their money to manipulate or deceive others into romantic interest, that could be seen as unethical. \n\nIn the post, he mentions that he's not being genuine when approaching girls\u2014he's showing off his wealth and talking about his dad's business. That might be considered inauthentic. But he does say that his friends aren't wealthy and he's a different person with them, helping with tuition and being more down-to-earth. So he's not entirely inauthentic in all aspects of his life, just in his romantic pursuits.\n\nAnother angle is whether the women are being taken advantage of. If the girls are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him, maybe they're okay with it. But if he's being deceptive, that's a problem. The post says he's not good-looking, so maybe he's compensating with wealth, but that doesn't make it right. It's about intentions and honesty.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important too. She called him an asshole, implying she sees his actions as manipulative or inauthentic. But that's her perspective, and others might have a different take. \n\nThe key points are: using wealth to attract partners, inauthentic presentation, potential manipulation, and the friend's disapproval. \n\nIs it wrong to use money to attract partners? It's a social judgment call. Some might say people can date whoever they want, but others might see it as exploiting wealth for personal gain. If it's a matter of being honest about one's intentions and not lying, maybe it's not inherently wrong. However, if the approach is seen as using others for their interest in his wealth rather than genuine connection, then it's unethical.\n\nSince the author is upfront about his tactics in the post (he admits to sounding like a douche), but the question is whether in reality he's in the wrong. The community's response to AITA posts often hinges on whether the person is being deceptive or intentionally hurting others. Here, the author isn't necessarily lying but is prioritizing wealth as a tool to attract women, which some might view as shallow or manipulative.\n\nConsidering these factors, the ethical stance would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's using his wealth as a primary tool to attract women, which can be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, even if he's not outright lying. The friend's shock and her labeling him an asshole support that perspective. However, there's an argument that he's not hurting anyone and that people have different preferences. But in the context of societal norms and the friend's reaction, the consensus might be that he's in the wrong.\n"
