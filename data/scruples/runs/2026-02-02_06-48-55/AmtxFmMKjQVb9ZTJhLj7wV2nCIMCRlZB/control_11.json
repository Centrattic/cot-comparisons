I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me read through the question again. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. He's getting a lot of attention from women because of this. He also mentions that when he's with his non-wealthy friends, he's a different person, using a regular car and going to normal places. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract romantic partners. Is it wrong to use your financial status to gain attention from others? On one hand, people are free to present themselves in certain ways to attract others. Everyone has different values and what they find attractive. If a woman is interested in someone because they're wealthy, that's her choice. But the author is being upfront about his intentions, right? He's not necessarily lying; he's just showcasing his wealth. However, there's a nuance here. He mentions that he's a different person when he's with his friends, which makes me wonder if he's being inauthentic in general.\n\nThen there's the part about his friend being shocked and calling him an asshole. The friend's reaction suggests that she finds his approach manipulative or insincere. The key point here is whether the author is being deceptive. If his main goal is to use his wealth to attract women without being genuine, that could be seen as using them for his own benefit. But if he's just being honest about his lifestyle and people are drawn to that, is that his fault?\n\nAnother angle is the concept of transactional relationships. Some people might be okay with dating someone for their wealth, while others might see it as a shallow or exploitative approach. The author is using his wealth as a tool to gain attention, which could be considered a form of manipulation. However, if he's not lying about who he is, maybe he's just leveraging his advantages. But the problem might be that he's not being his true self when approaching women, which could lead to insincere relationships.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping his friends with tuition and acting like a \"normal guy\" with them might contrast with his strategy when he's trying to attract women. This duality could be a sign of inauthenticity. If he's presenting a different version of himself to attract partners, is that inherently wrong? It might depend on the intent. If he's seeking relationships based on materialism rather than genuine connection, that could be problematic.\n\nBut then again, people do use various tactics to attract partners. Some might focus on fitness, others on hobbies, some on their careers. Wealth is just another asset someone might highlight. The line between using one's assets and being inauthentic is blurry. If the author is honest about his wealth and the women who approach him are aware of that, then it's a mutual choice. However, if he's pretending to be something he's not (like being a regular guy when he's actually wealthy), that could be deceptive.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She sees his approach as asshole-like, which might indicate that his actions are socially frowned upon. But is it wrong? It's possible that the author is more focused on materialistic displays rather than building genuine connections. This could be seen as shallow, but in terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, which implies a moral judgment. In many ethical frameworks, using wealth to manipulate others' affections could be considered unethical if it's done insincerely.\n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily lying. He's just showcasing his life. If the women are interested because of his wealth, that's their choice. The author's actions don't harm the women unless they're being misled. If the author is honest about his intentions and the women are aware, then it's a mutual arrangement. The problem arises if the author is leading the women to believe he's more genuine than he is. The key is whether there's deception involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's strategy might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative by some, if he's not lying and the women are attracted to his wealth of their own volition, he might not be in the wrong. However, the author's own acknowledgment of being a \"different person\" and the friend's negative reaction suggest that there's an element of insincerity. This insincerity might make the author in the wrong because he's not being genuine in his interactions, which can be considered unethical in forming relationships.\n"
