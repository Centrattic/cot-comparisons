I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user, a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family, is using his money and status to attract girls. He posts about his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram, which gets him a lot of attention from women. He's dressing better, driving his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business to impress them. He mentions that he's a different person around his non-wealthy friends, helping them pay tuition and being more down-to-earth. However, when he told one of his friends about his strategy, she called him an asshole and a douche.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break this down. First, using money to attract attention isn't inherently wrong, but intentions matter. If he's being deceptive or manipulative, that's a problem. He's not lying about his wealth, just highlighting it to attract girls. But is that deceptive? Maybe not, but it's about using money as a tool rather than building genuine connections. \n\nThen there's the aspect of authenticity. If he's presenting a different side of himself just to get dates, that could be seen as insincere. People might argue that relationships should be based on honesty and mutual interest, not material displays. On the other hand, if he's upfront about his intentions, maybe it's not his fault they're interested in his wealth. \n\nAnother angle is the reaction of his friend. She was shocked and criticized him harshly. But her reaction might stem from her own values or a belief that using money for dating is unethical. However, others might see it as a personal choice. \n\nHe also helps his friends financially, which shows he's not a bad person overall. But the key issue is whether using money to attract girls is morally wrong. In some perspectives, it's just a strategy, like any other dating tactic. In others, it's exploiting his wealth to manipulate perceptions. \n\nI need to consider societal norms and ethical standards. While it's common to present oneself in the best light on social media, doing so with the sole intent of attracting attention could be seen as superficial. However, unless he's lying or causing harm, it's not necessarily \"wrong.\" The friend's judgment is subjective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because he's using money as a tool to manipulate his image for personal gain, which could be seen as unethical in the context of relationships. But others might argue it's just a strategy. Still, the friend's strong negative reaction suggests that some people view this as inconsiderate or manipulative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
