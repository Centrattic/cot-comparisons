I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. The situation is that he's a trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started showcasing his wealth on social media, which led to more DMs from girls. He uses his nicer stuff when trying to impress them but acts more normal around his friends. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is being honest about his intentions\u2014using money to attract girls. But is that inherently wrong? People might argue that it's manipulative or insincere. Others might say it's his way of navigating social situations based on his insecurities. \n\nHe's also helping friends pay tuition, which shows he's not entirely selfish. However, the method of using wealth to attract could be seen as transactional. The key points here are intent and perception. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's choosing to present it as part of his social strategy. But when he told his friend, her reaction was negative, implying that deception or using materialism for romantic gain is frowned upon. \n\nIn relationships, authenticity is valued. If the author is only interested in physical relationships and using money as a tool, that could be seen as exploiting others. However, if the girls are aware and still engage, maybe it's consensual. Yet, the question is about being in the wrong, not the girls' consent. The author's actions might be considered unethical if it's about using wealth to manipulate rather than genuine connection. \n\nBut on the other hand, people have different ways of attracting partners. It's not illegal or against social norms to present oneself in a certain way. The line is blurry here. The author isn't lying about his wealth, just choosing to highlight it. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but others might judge him for it. The friend's reaction is a social judgment, but does that make him wrong? \n\nI think the answer depends on whether using wealth is considered deceptive. Since he's not hiding his wealth when he's trying to attract girls, it's honest in a way, but the intent to use it for that purpose could be seen as shallow. However, personal choices in dating are subjective. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but the friend's opinion is valid. The answer could be B (No), as it's his strategy, but it's a matter of perspective.\n"
