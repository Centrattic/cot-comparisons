I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that the author is a young man from a wealthy family, not good-looking, and he's been using social media to showcase his assets to get attention from women. He mentions that he's different around his friends, not flaunting his wealth there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is being honest about his intentions\u2014using money to attract girls. But is that inherently wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say it's manipulative or using others for wealth, which is unethical. Others might argue that it's a strategy, and if the women are aware of his wealth and choose to engage, it's their choice.\n\nThen there's the part where he spilled the beans to a friend who was shocked. That friend's reaction suggests that his behavior is seen as inconsiderate or arrogant. The friend called him an asshole, which indicates that his actions crossed a social line in her eyes. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe he's being hypocritical if he's helping friends by paying their tuition but uses wealth for personal gain in relationships. That could be seen as inconsistent or exploiting his wealth for different purposes in different contexts.\n\nAnother angle: the women he interacts with might be interested in his money rather than his personality. If he's not being truthful about his intentions, that could be a problem. However, if he's upfront and they're okay with it, then it's their choice. The key is whether he's deceiving them. The author says he talks about his dad's business and future involvement, which might be part of the act. If he's not genuine in those interactions, that's another layer of deceit.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's a trust fund kid and not the one earning the money might make it feel like he's bragging about something he didn't earn, which some might find off-putting. It's about authenticity and whether it's fair to use inherited wealth to gain attention.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might view it as shallow or transactional, but others might not see it as a big issue. The friend's reaction is a data point, but it's just one person's opinion. The question is whether the author's actions violate a moral standard that others would recognize.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is using his wealth to gain social advantages, which some might see as inauthentic or manipulative. The fact that he's different with his friends suggests he's aware of the potential for hypocrisy. The act of using money as a tool to attract partners could be seen as treating the women as means to an end, which is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong).\n"
