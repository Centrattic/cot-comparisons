I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy uses his wealth to attract girls by showing off his stuff on social media, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He's also helping his friends with tuition but acts differently around them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants others' opinions. I need to decide A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the guy is using his wealth to manipulate his image to attract women. That's a form of using money to gain social advantages, which might be seen as inauthentic. He's leading with materialism and status, which could be superficial. Also, the fact that he's being deceptive when talking to the girls about his intentions\u2014maybe they don't know he's doing it just for that purpose. But the scenario doesn't say if he's being honest with the girls about his motives. If he's not upfront, that could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing anyone; if the girls are interested, maybe it's their choice. Also, the guy helps his friends financially and acts normally around them, which shows he's not entirely bad. But the friend called him an asshole because he was using money to get girls, which she found manipulative. \n\nThe key points here are authenticity, manipulation, and deception. If he's being honest about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not just to attract girls, that's a problem. The scenario says he's using wealth as a tool to catch their attention, which is a strategy, but not necessarily illegal. However, in terms of ethics or social norms, some might see it as inauthentic or using others for his benefit. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is socially frowned upon. The fact that he had to tell the friend implies that he felt the need to justify or explain his actions, which might indicate guilt or awareness that it's not the right approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using money to manipulate his social image for personal gain (romantic attention), which can be seen as inauthentic and perhaps manipulative. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
