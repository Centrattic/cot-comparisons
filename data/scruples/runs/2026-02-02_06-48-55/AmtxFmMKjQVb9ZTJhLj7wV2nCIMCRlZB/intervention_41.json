I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good looking and finds it hard to get dates, so he started using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, etc. on social media. He mentions that when he's with his friends who aren't wealthy, he acts more normally. But when he told one of his friends about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants a second opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract partners. Some might argue that it's his choice how he presents himself, and if the girls are interested, then maybe it's their own choice. Others might see it as inauthentic or manipulative, using superficial aspects rather than genuine connection.\n\nHe's being upfront about his intentions\u2014only doing it to get with girls. That transparency is a point, but does it matter if others are being attracted by the material things? Then there's the friend who was shocked. She might feel he's being deceptive or arrogant. \n\nAlso, he's helping his friends pay tuition, so there's a contrast between how he behaves in different contexts. Maybe he's not trying to deceive his friends. But when it comes to dating, his approach could be seen as transactional.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, using wealth to attract partners might be considered shallow or using status for social capital, which some people frown upon. But it's not illegal or harmful in a direct sense. The key is whether it's morally wrong. The friend's reaction suggests that society might look down on it, but others might say he's being honest about his approach.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's manipulating his image to attract others, which can be seen as insincere and could lead to relationships based on materialism rather than authenticity. So answer A.\n"
