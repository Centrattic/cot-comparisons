I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his money on social media and in person. He's honest with his friends about this approach, but when he told one of his friends, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which could be seen as manipulative. However, the women he's attracting are initiating contact after seeing his posts, so maybe they are aware of his situation. But the problem might be whether he's being deceptive or if he's using his wealth in a way that's exploitative. \n\nHe mentions that when he's with his non-wealthy friends, he's more modest, driving a Honda and going to student bars. This duality might be a point of contention. The friend who was shocked suggests that his behavior is inconsiderate or inauthentic. \n\nThe key question is whether using wealth to attract romantic partners is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's a strategy, similar to others using looks or charm. Others might see it as shallow or objectifying. However, if he's not lying about his intentions and the women are choosing to engage with him, it's a matter of personal ethics. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's being insincere in his interactions with women, pretending to be a different person just to get dates, that could be considered deceitful. The fact that he's open with his friends about his tactics shows some honesty, but the issue is whether that's acceptable in the context of dating.\n\nI think the author's actions are ethically questionable. While he's not lying about his wealth, using it as a primary tool to attract women might be seen as exploiting their material desires or creating a false impression of his character. The fact that his friend called him an asshole indicates that some people view this behavior as inconsiderate or manipulative. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
