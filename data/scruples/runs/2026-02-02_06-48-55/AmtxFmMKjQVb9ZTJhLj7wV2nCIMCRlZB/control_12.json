I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family who's using his financial status to attract girls. He's posting about his condo, cars, trips on Instagram, dressing better, driving his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. He admits he's doing this to \"get with girls\" and even mentions that he's different when he's with his less wealthy friends, helping them pay tuition and acting normally.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. He's using his wealth to attract attention, which he's honest about. But is that inherently wrong? On one hand, people often use their assets to attract others\u2014it's not illegal, and he's being upfront with himself. However, manipulating social media to appear wealthier than he is (if he's not actually that wealthy) might be a factor, but the story says his family is pretty wealthy and he's a trust fund kid, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nThen there's the part where he told a friend about his method, and she called him a douche. That's a personal opinion, but maybe she felt he was being inauthentic or using others. The author's friends aren't wealthy, and he's helping them financially, which might balance things out. But does that make it okay? He's using money to attract girls, which could be seen as superficial or transactional. However, the article mentions he's not good-looking, which might make it harder for him socially, but that's not an excuse.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to use one's resources to attract romantic interest? It's a bit of a gray area. People often use various tactics to attract others, whether it's through looks, hobbies, or status. But if he's being deceptive or misleading, that's a problem. The story says he's not pretending to be someone else except in terms of showcasing his wealth. He's not lying about his identity, just highlighting his wealth in a way that might not be genuine in all aspects of his life.\n\nAnother angle: when he's with friends, he's not using the wealth, which shows he's authentic with them. But when trying to attract girls, he's using a different persona. Is that double standard wrong? Maybe he's being inauthentic in his dating life, which could lead to issues if the relationships aren't built on honesty.\n\nBut then again, isn't everyone's online presence curated to some extent? People present their best selves on social media. So, maybe it's not as wrong as it seems. However, the key point is that he's doing it specifically to attract girls, which could be seen as manipulative. If the girls find out he was just using his wealth to impress them, they might feel used. The friend's reaction suggests she thinks he's being inauthentic and maybe exploiting his status.\n\nIn summary, while it's not illegal, the ethical issue is about honesty and authenticity in relationships. The author is using his wealth strategically to attract attention, which could be seen as insincere. However, people often use their assets (whether wealth, looks, education) to attract others. The line is crossed if there's deception or if it's harming others. Since the author isn't lying about his character but is using his status as a tool, it's debatable. But the fact that his friend called him an asshole might indicate societal judgment against using wealth for such purposes, even if it's not illegal.\n"
