I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old man with a trust fund, uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's changed his behavior to appear more affluent, like dressing better and taking his nicer car out. He also mentions that he helps his friends financially and acts more normally when he's with them. However, when he told a friend about his tactics, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract romantic partners. This could be seen as using someone for their looks in exchange for material benefits, which can be problematic. It might not be respectful to the girls he's interacting with if they're not aware of his intentions or if they're only interested in his wealth rather than his personality. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest with himself about his motivations. He's not hiding his intentions from himself, but maybe he's not being transparent with the girls. There's also the aspect of his behavior towards his friends. He acts differently around them, showing a more authentic side, which suggests he has a dual standard. The friend's reaction implies that his actions are inconsiderate or deceptive, which could be a sign that he's in the wrong.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and what constitutes manipulation. If someone is using a strategy to attract others based on superficial traits, it can be seen as a form of manipulation. Additionally, the fact that he's using social media to curate an image to get attention might be considered insincere. However, it's his choice how to present himself, even if others might disapprove. \n\nThe key points are: using wealth to attract partners, potential deception (if he's not upfront with the girls), and hypocrisy in his behavior (acting differently around friends). The friend's judgment is important here, but it's also possible that she's projecting her own values. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, if someone is being honest about their intentions in a relationship, it's better. But if they're leading others on or being insincere, that's where the problem lies. The author might be in a gray area because he's not necessarily lying, but he's being selective about how he presents himself. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is using his wealth as a tool to attract partners, which could be seen as shallow or manipulative. The act of curating a social media image to appear more desirable could be considered inauthentic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's using others for his own gain without genuine connection. However, some might argue that it's his prerogative to use his resources as he sees fit. \n\nBut given that the friend called him an asshole, and the general societal view that using people for material benefits is frowned upon, the answer leans towards A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
