I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and in person. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates otherwise. He also helps friends pay tuition and behaves differently around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Is using wealth to attract others inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's manipulative or insincere. Others might say that everyone uses their assets (like looks, skills, wealth) to some extent to attract partners. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just being upfront about it. However, the fact that he's using it solely for romantic purposes could be seen as superficial or transactional.\n\nThe friend's reaction is that the author is an asshole/douche. That's a strong opinion. But does that mean he's wrong? People have different values. Some might see it as honest self-promotion, others as inauthentic. Also, the author helps his friends financially, which could show he's not a bad person overall. But the question is about the specific action of using money to get girls.\n\nAnother angle: consent and honesty. The girls are aware of his wealth through his posts, so they choose to engage. It's not like he's lying about who he is. However, if the intention is purely to attract them by showcasing wealth, maybe it's not genuine. But people often have multiple motives in relationships. \n\nIs there harm? The author isn't directly harming the girls; they're choosing to interact. The issue might be more about perception\u2014some might find it shallow, others might see it as honest. The author's friend is shocked, but that's a personal reaction. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and harm. If the author isn't lying and the girls aren't being deceived, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if it's seen as using people, then it is. The line is blurry. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because using wealth to attract people can be seen as manipulative and insincere, even if it's not illegal. The author is prioritizing appearance over genuine connection, which might be considered unethical in relationships.\n"
