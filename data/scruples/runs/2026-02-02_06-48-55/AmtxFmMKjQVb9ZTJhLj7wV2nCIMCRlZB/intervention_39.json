I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates, so he's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. He's getting a lot of DMs from girls, which he uses to his advantage. He mentions that he's dressing better and driving his nicer car more often to catch attention. He also talks about his dad's business and his future plans. \n\nHe says he's a different person when he's with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and using a more modest car. However, when he told one of his friends about his strategy, she was shocked and called him an asshole for using money to get girls.\n\nSo the main question is whether using wealth to attract romantic partners is wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using financial status as a means to attract others. Is it inherently wrong to use one's assets, whether that's money, looks, or other resources, to gain attention? People often use various tactics to attract partners\u2014some might use humor, others their skills or appearance. Money can be a tool in that context. However, the issue might be in the intent or the honesty. If someone is using money as a facade to mask their insecurities or to manipulate, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author is being upfront about his intentions, though indirectly. He's not lying about his wealth; he's showcasing it. But the problem arises when his actions are perceived as insincere or as using others for material gain. The friend's reaction suggests that she views his behavior as inauthentic or exploitative. She called him an asshole, which indicates she feels he's being disingenuous.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationships. If he's using money to attract girls, it might imply that the relationships aren't based on genuine connection but on materialism. This could lead to the girls feeling used if they find out later, or it could create an imbalance where the girls are interested in the lifestyle rather than the person. \n\nHowever, if the girls are aware of his wealth and are still interested, perhaps it's a mutual benefit. But the author admits he's a different person when he's with his friends, which might indicate a lack of authenticity in his interactions with the girls. He's putting on a persona that's all about his wealth, which could be seen as inauthentic.\n\nThe question is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's not wrong as long as there's no deception. Others might say it's wrong because it's using materialism as the primary means of attraction, which can devalue genuine qualities. The friend's reaction supports the idea that this behavior is seen as inauthentic and exploitative in the eyes of others, which could lead to the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the ethical implications and the friend's negative reaction, the author might be in the wrong for using his wealth in a manipulative way to attract girls, even if he's not lying about it. The key issue is the insincerity and the potential exploitation of others for material gain in romantic contexts.\n"
