I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's a wealthy man using his money to attract women by showcasing his wealth on social media. He's dressing nicer, driving his nicer car, talking about his dad's business, etc. He's also been helping his friends pay tuition but acts more down-to-earth with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here seems to be using wealth to attract women. Is that inherently wrong? Some might argue that it's just a strategy, like any other, to attract partners. Others might see it as inauthentic or manipulative. The question is whether the means he's using are unethical.\n\nHe's being honest with the women he's attracting, right? He's showing his wealth and talking about his family's business. If the women are interested in that, maybe they're choosing him for his wealth, and he's aware of that. But if he's not being genuine in those interactions, maybe that's an issue. However, the problem becomes when someone uses their resources to manipulate or deceive others for personal gain, which could be seen as exploiting others for their own benefit.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of his friend. She called him an asshole/douche, which suggests that his friend perceives it as unethical. But friends' opinions can vary, and maybe the friend has different values. The author is helping his friends financially, so why the negative reaction? Perhaps it's because he's using wealth to manipulate relationships, which his friend sees as disrespectful or shallow.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's a different person with his friends, driving a Honda and going to student bars. This implies that he's presenting a different version of himself when trying to attract women. If he's being inauthentic in those situations, maybe that's where the problem lies. However, people often present different aspects of themselves in different social contexts. The line might be crossed when it's about deception rather than just social strategy.\n\nIs using wealth to attract partners inherently wrong? It depends on cultural and personal values. Some might say that as long as both parties are aware and consent, it's okay. Others might find it exploitative. The key here is whether he's being transparent. Since he's showcasing his wealth openly, the women are likely aware of his status. However, if he's pretending to be something he's not (like genuinely interested in someone without expecting anything in return), that's different. But the author admits he's using these tactics solely to get with girls, which could imply he's not interested in genuine connections.\n\nSo, the author is using wealth as a tool to attract women, which some might see as using his privilege to gain an advantage. This could be considered manipulative or transactional, which could be seen as unethical. On the other hand, if the women are equally interested in his wealth and enter into relationships knowing that, then maybe it's mutual. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the women's choices.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friend's reaction points to a social judgment that this behavior is negative. The friend calls him an asshole, which suggests that his action is viewed as morally wrong by others. However, personal ethics can vary, so one person's opinion doesn't necessarily define wrongness.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as inauthentic and potentially exploitative, using wealth as a primary tool to attract others without genuine connection. This manipulation for personal gain might make him in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
