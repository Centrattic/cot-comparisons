I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, part of a trust fund. He mentions that he's not good-looking and struggles to get girls, so he switched tactics by showcasing his wealth on Instagram\u2014posting condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car to catch attention, and talks about his dad's business. He admits he's being a \"douche\" but only does it to get with girls. However, he's a normal guy with friends who aren't wealthy and helps them pay tuition. He acts differently around them, using his Honda and going to student bars. When he told a friend about his strategy, she was shocked and called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider ethical perspectives. Using wealth to attract others could be seen as manipulative or insincere. The author is presenting a false image to achieve a personal goal, which might be deceptive. But he's also honest about his intentions, as he tells a friend. However, the friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is viewed negatively by others.\n\nAnother angle: consent and transparency. If the girls he interacts with are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for that reason, maybe it's a mutual game. But if they're not aware and he's being deceptive, that's a problem. The key is whether he's being honest in his interactions. The author says he's a different person when with his friends, implying that his behavior towards girls is not genuine. This insincerity could be considered wrong, as it's not authentic and might lead to superficial relationships.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using social media to curate an image for a specific purpose (dating) might be seen as exploitative. It's about leveraging his wealth to attract attention, which could be viewed as shallow. However, people do use social media to present their best selves, so there's a line here between normal self-presentation and using wealth as a tool for dating.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She sees him as an asshole, which indicates that his behavior is socially unacceptable to others. Even if there's no legal wrongdoing, the social judgment here is a key factor. The author might be violating social norms about authenticity and sincerity in relationships.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that everyone uses certain strategies to attract partners, and wealth isn't inherently wrong. If the girls are interested and it's mutual, maybe it's not his fault. But the problem arises when the strategy is insincere and used solely for personal gain without regard for others' feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions involve using wealth in a deceptive or insincere manner for personal gain in dating, which many would see as inauthentic and potentially manipulative. His friend's negative reaction supports the idea that he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
