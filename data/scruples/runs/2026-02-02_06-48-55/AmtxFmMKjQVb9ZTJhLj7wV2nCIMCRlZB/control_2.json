I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls on social media. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not considered good-looking. He started posting his luxury items like condos, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram to get more followers and attention from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business in trendy places to catch their attention. He admits he's doing this solely to get with girls and claims he's a different person when with his non-wealthy friends, even helping them pay tuition. His friend was shocked when he told her about this strategy and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Using money to attract others can be seen as manipulative or insincere. The author is being honest with himself about his motives, but is he being deceptive to others? The girls he interacts with might be interested in his wealth rather than him as a person, which could lead to shallow or transactional relationships. However, if the author is upfront about his intentions, it's not exactly deception. But in the scenario, he doesn't mention whether he's honest with the girls about his motives. He's just using his wealth as a tool to attract attention, which might not be truthful if his primary goal is to use money for social validation rather than forming genuine connections.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of his friend. She called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are socially frowned upon. The fact that he had to \"spill the beans\" when she asked how he gets attention implies that he felt it was necessary to justify his methods, which might reflect poorly on him. His behavior could be seen as exploiting his wealth for personal gain in a way that's inconsiderate or disrespectful to women, reducing them to objects of desire that can be attracted through material displays.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that people use various strategies to attract others, and wealth is just another tool. If the author isn't lying about who he is and is honest with the women he dates, then it's a matter of personal choice. The problem arises if he's being deceptive or if the relationships are based on insincere intentions. The key here is whether the author's actions are misleading. Since he's using his wealth as a means to attract attention, it's possible that the women are drawn to his material success, but if the author isn't hiding his wealth and is honest about his intentions when dating, then it's his choice. However, the fact that he's doing this for attention and not for genuine connection could be ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, helping his friends pay tuition and being a different person around them shows that he's not entirely shallow. This duality might indicate that he's aware of the inauthenticity of his methods and is trying to balance a genuine side with his social strategies. The moral judgment here depends on whether using wealth to attract dates is considered wrong. Some might see it as a valid strategy, while others might view it as exploiting materialism for personal gain.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many people might find it off-putting if someone is clearly using their wealth to impress others for romantic purposes. It can come off as shallow and transactional. The friend's reaction supports this by labeling him an asshole, implying that his actions are seen as manipulative or disrespectful. The author's own admission that he's \"a huge douche\" in this context also suggests self-awareness of the negative perception.\n\nConsidering all these points, the consensus leans towards the author being in the wrong because his actions are primarily about using his wealth as a tool for attracting women rather than building genuine relationships. This approach can be seen as unethical in the context of dating, where authenticity and mutual respect are typically valued.\n"
