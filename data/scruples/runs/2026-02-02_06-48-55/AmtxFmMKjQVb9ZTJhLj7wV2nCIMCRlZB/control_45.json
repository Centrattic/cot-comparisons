I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that the guy is from a wealthy family, uses social media to showcase his wealth, and gets attention from women. He admits he's not good-looking, so he's using his money to compensate. He's also helping friends by paying their tuition but switches to a more \"normal\" persona when with them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, first, what are the arguments for AITA (Author Is To Blame)? Well, using money to attract people can be seen as superficial or manipulative. It might be considered using wealth as a tool to gain something (romantic attention) rather than being genuine. The friend's reaction suggests that others might view this as inauthentic or even exploitative. Also, the guy is admitting he does this solely to get with girls, which could be seen as insincere in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments against AITA might be that he's just using what he has to navigate social situations. Everyone uses different advantages, and it's not illegal. People often present themselves in ways that are appealing on social media. Also, he's helping friends with tuition and being a different person around them, which shows he has a genuine side. The friend's shock might stem from her own values, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong.\n\nBut the key here is intent. If someone is using their wealth to attract partners solely for sexual or romantic purposes without being genuine, it's a form of manipulation. The fact that he's being inauthentic in his interactions could be problematic. Relationships built on superficiality might not be healthy, and if he's not being his true self, that's an issue. Also, the act of \"trading\" money for attention could be seen as transactional, which some might find off-putting.\n\nAnother angle is that the guy is not forcing anyone; the girls are choosing to engage with him. So maybe it's not the author's fault if others make choices based on his posts. But again, if he's being deceptive about his intentions, that's different. Wait, he's not lying per se; he's being open about his wealth and his future plans. But he's using that as a strategy, which could be seen as calculated.\n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, which is a social judgment. However, social judgments can vary. Some people might find this acceptable, others not. The question is whether he's objectively in the wrong. The act of using wealth to attract isn't inherently unethical, but if it's done in a way that's deceptive or exploitative, that's another matter.\n\nHe's not lying about his wealth, just using it to his advantage. People often do that. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not, like acting interested in a girl when he's only after a relationship, that's insincere. The problem here is that he's using a strategy to attract girls he wouldn't normally attract, which could be seen as manipulative. But is that wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The AITA community usually considers whether the person's actions are against social norms or if they've wronged someone else. Since the girls aren't complaining, but the friend is, it's about perception.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, using wealth as a tool to gain romantic attention, which some might consider shallow or transactional. However, since it's not against any rules and the girls are choosing to engage, it's a matter of opinion. But given the friend's reaction and the common judgment against such behavior, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because it's about being genuine versus using superficial means.\n"
