I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, uses his wealth to post luxury items on social media to get attention from women. He also mentions changing his behavior when around his friends, who aren't wealthy, and he pays for their tuition. His friend called him an asshole for being deceitful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether using wealth as a tool to attract romantic attention is wrong. Some might argue that it's manipulative or inauthentic, while others might say it's just a strategy in the dating game. The author is upfront about his intentions with the girls, but he's being two-faced when it comes to his friends, which could be a point against him.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. She was shocked and called him an asshole, suggesting that the author's actions are seen as dishonest or disrespectful. The author's behavior could be seen as exploiting his wealth to gain attention he wouldn't otherwise get, which might be considered in poor taste or even predatory.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not explicitly lying about who he is; he's just highlighting certain aspects of his life that he's fortunate to have. People often use their advantages in social situations, whether that's looks, charm, or money. But the key question is whether it's wrong to use those advantages for personal gain in dating.\n\nI think the author is using his wealth in a way that's more about manipulation than genuine connection. The fact that he's a different person when with his friends shows a lack of authenticity, which could be seen as deceitful. Plus, the girls might not be aware that his interest in them is purely based on his wealth, which could lead to superficial relationships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
