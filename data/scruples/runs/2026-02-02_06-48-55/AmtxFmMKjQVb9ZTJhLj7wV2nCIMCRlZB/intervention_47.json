I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. He's gotten a lot of DMs from \"hot girls\" and has changed his behavior to appear more affluent\u2014driving nicer cars, dressing better, going to trendy places. He talks about his dad's business and his future role in it to impress women. He mentions that he's a different person when he's with his non-wealthy friends, even helping them pay tuition and driving his Honda with them. However, when he told one of his friends about this strategy, she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know others' opinions. The answer should be A for yes or B for no.\n\nFirst, let me consider the ethical implications. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which some might see as manipulative or insincere. He's presenting a curated version of himself, which could be seen as deceptive. However, if someone is aware of their own intentions and chooses to act on them, does that make it wrong? On the other hand, using wealth to attract partners isn't inherently unethical, but if it's done with the sole purpose of exploiting the other person's interest in wealth, that could be problematic.\n\nHe's being honest with his friends about his methods, but that's where the conflict arises. His friend's reaction suggests that she finds his approach inauthentic and possibly exploitative. The key points here are authenticity and the intent behind his actions. If he's using his wealth to attract women without any genuine interest in them, just for companionship, that could be seen as selfish or shallow. However, people often use various tactics to attract others, whether it's fashion, hobbies, or other interests. The line might be crossed when it's done with full awareness and the intention to manipulate others' perceptions.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on his relationships. If he's being two-faced\u2014different with friends versus potential romantic interests\u2014it might indicate a lack of authenticity. The fact that he helps his friends financially shows he's not entirely self-serving, but his approach to dating is different. The issue could be that he's not being genuine in his romantic pursuits, which might hurt others if they find out he's only interested in them for what they can offer or if they feel used.\n\nSociety often judges people for using wealth to attract partners, viewing it as superficial. But everyone has preferences. The problem arises when one person's preferences lead to exploitation or deceit. In this case, the author isn't necessarily lying about his wealth, but he's emphasizing it in a way that might not reflect his true personality. The act of curating his image on social media is a form of self-promotion, which is common, but when it's solely for the purpose of dating, it might be seen as inauthentic.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction indicates that his approach is considered unethical or inconsiderate by others. While personal choice is a factor, societal norms often dictate that using wealth to attract others is frowned upon, especially if it's done with the intent to manipulate. The author's justification that he's just trying to get dates might not excuse the method if it's perceived as deceptive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be in the wrong because they involve using wealth to manipulate others' perceptions for personal gain in dating, which can be seen as insincere and exploitative. The friend's reaction supports the idea that this behavior is viewed negatively by others. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
