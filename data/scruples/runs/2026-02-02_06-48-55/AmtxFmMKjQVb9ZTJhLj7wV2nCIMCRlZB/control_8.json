I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using money to attract girls.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family. He mentions that he's not good-looking and has struggled with relationships. His new approach is to flaunt his wealth on social media by posting about his condo, cars, trips, etc., which has increased his followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also changes his behavior when trying to meet girls\u2014driving his nicer car, going to trendy places, talking about his dad's business. But when with friends who aren't wealthy, he's more down-to-earth, helps pay their tuition, and drives a Honda.\n\nHe told a female friend about his tactics, and she called him an asshole/douche. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, what's the moral issue here? Using money to attract others\u2014flashing wealth to get attention. Is that inherently wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might argue that using material possessions to attract people is superficial and insincere. Others might say that it's his personal choice and not hurting anyone directly, as long as he's honest about his intentions.\n\nThe author is upfront about his methods being a tactic to get with girls, which suggests he's aware of being inauthentic. The friend's reaction is negative, calling him an asshole, which implies she sees it as manipulative or fake. However, the author claims he's a different person with non-wealthy friends, helping them financially, which shows a contrast in behavior. This might indicate that he's aware of his inauthenticity in the dating context but genuine in friendships.\n\nIs it unethical? Manipulation for personal gain can be seen as wrong, especially if it's deceptive. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract others, which could be considered using his privilege in a way that's not fair or honest in relationships. Relationships ideally require authenticity, and using materialism as a primary tool might undermine that. However, if both parties are aware and okay with it, some might argue it's not his fault. But since the question is about being in the wrong, it's more about societal norms and ethical standards rather than legal or concrete rules.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a key point. Her judgment suggests that society might frown upon such tactics. Also, the author's own admission that he's \"a huge douche\" but does it only for girls shows he's aware of the inauthenticity. The fact that he's helping friends financially in a genuine way contrasts with his manipulative approach in dating, reinforcing that his dating behavior is inauthentic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the consensus might lean toward the author being in the wrong (A) because he's using materialism and inauthentic behavior to manipulate situations, which is generally considered unethical in relationships. However, there's a counterargument that it's his choice and not illegal. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral judgment. Since the friend's reaction is negative and the author's methods are insincere, the answer is likely A.\n"
