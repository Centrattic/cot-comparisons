I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family, a trust fund kid. He's not considered good-looking and has had trouble attracting girls. To address this, he's been using his wealth as a way to gain attention. He posts pictures of his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram, which has increased his followers and led to many DMs from attractive women. For a year now, he dresses better, uses his nicer car, and goes to trendy places to catch girls' eyes. He also talks about his dad's business and his plans to join it next year. He admits he sounds like a douche but does this solely to get with girls. Otherwise, he's a normal guy, and his friends aren't wealthy. He actually helps two of them pay tuition and acts differently around them, using his Honda and going to normal student bars. He recently told one of his friends about his tactic after she asked how he dates hot girls, and she was shocked, calling him a big asshole/douche in the city.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications here. Using money to attract attention, especially in dating, can be seen as manipulative. People might argue that it's not wrong to use one's assets, but if it's done to manipulate others, that's a problem. The author is being honest with himself, acknowledging he sounds like a douche. The key points are his intent, the impact on others, and the broader context of his behavior.\n\nHe's not being deceptive about his wealth, so that's a plus. He's upfront about his intention to attract girls through showcasing his money. However, the way he's doing it might be considered shallow or objectifying. By focusing on material possessions and his family's business, he's possibly reducing his interactions with women to their potential attraction to money rather than genuine connection. \n\nThen there's the part about his friends. He helps them pay tuition and acts differently when with them. This duality might be a red flag. He's using his wealth in a way that's perceived as fake or insincere in his personal relationships, which could lead to mistrust. His friend's reaction indicates that his behavior is seen as inauthentic and possibly exploitative when it comes to his dating life. \n\nThe author is engaging in a strategy that's common in some dating circles, often referred to as \"playing the market\" or using wealth to attract partners. But is that inherently wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say people are free to use their resources, but others argue that it's using manipulation or misleading others by appearing to be someone they're not (like a self-made success instead of a trust fund kid). \n\nAlso, the fact that he admits to being a \"huge douche\" but does it anyway shows he's aware of the negative connotations. The friend's shock suggests that even people who know him might find this tactic surprising or unethical. \n\nIn terms of consent and respect, the girls aren't forced to engage with him; they initiate DMs. But if he's using his posts to signal wealth as a way to attract them, it's a form of manipulation. It's not illegal, but it's ethically questionable. \n\nAnother angle: is it wrong to use one's resources to attract partners? If both parties are aware and it's a mutual game, maybe not. But if he's pretending to be someone else (like a successful entrepreneur rather than a trust fund kid), that's different. However, the author is open about his intentions and his background. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She might feel that he's being hypocritical, given that he's a regular guy with her but uses his wealth to attract others. This duality could be seen as inauthentic and thus wrong. \n\nI think the core issue is whether the author is being genuine. If he's only using his wealth to attract girls without any intention of building a real relationship, that's manipulative. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the success of the tactic. \n\nThe author's actions aren't harmful per se, but they do reflect a lack of authenticity and could be seen as exploiting the materialistic tendencies of others. It's a judgment call, but many would consider this in the wrong because it's using another person's potential material desires to form a relationship, which isn't based on mutual respect and genuine connection. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
