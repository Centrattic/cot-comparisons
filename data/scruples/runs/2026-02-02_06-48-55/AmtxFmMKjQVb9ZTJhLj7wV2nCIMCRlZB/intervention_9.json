I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The situation is that he's a wealthy trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. He started showcasing his wealth on social media, which led to more DMs from attractive women. He mentions that he uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his family's business to impress them. He also helps his non-wealthy friends by paying their tuition and acts normally around them, but when he told one of them about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using wealth to attract others is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's a game he's playing, using his resources to compensate for his lack of other attributes. Others might say it's manipulative or inauthentic. The key points here are intent and impact. His intention is clearly to get dates, but he's being upfront with the ladies by showing his wealth. However, the criticism from his friend is that he's being a douche, which could imply that he's not being genuine or that he's exploiting his wealth to gain attention without substance.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of authenticity. If he's presenting a different version of himself to attract women, it could be seen as inauthentic. But if he's not pretending to be someone he's not in other areas (like with his friends), maybe he's just using what he has to his advantage. But the problem arises when it's clear he's only doing it to get with girls, which might be considered superficial or shallow.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a sign that there's a social judgment against what he's doing. Even if it's not illegal or unethical in a strict sense, societal norms might frown upon using wealth as a primary means to attract romantic interest. It could be seen as transactional or objectifying, where he's leveraging his financial status rather than building genuine connections.\n\nBut there's also the argument that it's his personal life and he's not harming anyone else. The women who DM him might be aware of his status and still choose to engage, so it's a mutual decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the women are. The main issue is whether his approach is deceptive. If he's being honest about his intentions and the women are also aware, maybe it's a fair game. But if he's leading them on or not being transparent, that's a different story.\n\nIn the scenario, he does mention that he's different when with his friends, using a regular car and going to normal bars. This contrast might highlight that he's putting on a persona for the girls, which could be seen as insincere. The act of using wealth to attract could be viewed as exploiting his resources for personal gain, which isn't necessarily wrong in a legal sense but might be morally questionable depending on cultural values.\n\nThe friend's shock and calling him an asshole indicate that his actions are crossing a social boundary in the eyes of others. Even if he's not breaking any rules, the judgment from his peer suggests that there's an ethical concern. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If he's using his wealth to gain attention without genuine connection, it could be seen as shallow or manipulative.\n\nIn summary, while it's his life and he's not harming anyone directly, the use of wealth as a primary tool to attract others can be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, leading others to view him negatively. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong because his approach is based on superficiality and might exploit his wealth to gain attention without genuine effort towards building real relationships.\n"
