I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who isn't good-looking and has struggled with dating. He started using social media to showcase his wealth, which led to more attention from girls. He's open about his intentions, but when he told a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author isn't lying about his intentions; he's upfront about using his wealth to attract others. However, the question is whether this is inherently wrong. On one hand, people can choose to present themselves in ways that attract others, and wealth is a personal asset. On the other hand, using wealth to seduce others might be seen as transactional or manipulative. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She found out and was shocked, implying that the author's friends might view this as deceitful. The author mentions he's a different person when he's with friends, which suggests he's hiding his true self from them. This could be a point against him, as authenticity in relationships is often valued. \n\nAnother angle is whether the girls are aware of his intentions. If he's honest with them and they're okay with it, then it's a matter of mutual agreement. However, if he's leading them on without being clear, that's a problem. The author doesn't specify if he's honest with the girls, which is a gray area. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping friends pay tuition shows he's not just selfish. But this doesn't necessarily absolve him of his actions towards the girls. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical stance is debatable. Using wealth to attract others isn't inherently wrong, but the lack of authenticity and potential manipulation could make it problematic. The key factors are honesty and mutual consent in the interactions with the girls. Since the author is upfront about his intentions (as per his own statement), it might be a matter of personal ethics. However, the friend's negative reaction indicates societal judgment. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the deceptive behavior towards friends and potential manipulation, even if the action itself isn't illegal.\n"
