I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man who's using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his assets on Instagram, dressing better, and talking about his family's business. He's also helping his less wealthy friends by paying their tuition and being a different person with them. But when he told one of his friends about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants another opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using money to attract partners. Using wealth to gain attention could be seen as manipulative or insincere if the sole purpose is to impress others for romantic reasons. The author is being upfront with the women by showing his wealth, but maybe that's not the issue. The problem might be in the intent\u2014using materialism as a tool rather than building genuine connections. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's doing this to compensate for not feeling good-looking adds another layer. It might be a coping mechanism, but does that justify it? People use different methods to attract others, but when it comes down to manipulation or exploitation, it's a problem. \n\nThen there's the friend who said he's an asshole. She might see it as using his wealth to get what he wants, which can be perceived as arrogant or inconsiderate. Even if he's helping his friends, the way he's approaching relationships with women could be seen as transactional. \n\nBut another angle is that it's his choice how he presents himself. If the women are interested and he's honest about his intentions, maybe it's not his fault. However, if the women aren't interested in him for who he is, but only his money, that could lead to issues. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the women's responses. \n\nAlso, the author is being deceptive in a way. He's presenting a different side of himself publicly to attract women, while being different around his friends. That duality might be a problem. But is it wrong to curate one's image for social media? People do that all the time. \n\nThe key points are intent and authenticity. If he's not being genuine in his interactions with the women, and his main goal is to use his wealth to attract them, then it's a form of manipulation. However, if he's just using his wealth as part of his identity and not lying, maybe it's not. \n\nThe fact that he's helping his friends financially shows he's not entirely self-centered, but the issue is with his approach to dating. The friend's reaction suggests that his actions are seen negatively, possibly because they're seen as inauthentic or exploitative. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's using his wealth in a manipulative way to attract women, which can be considered inauthentic and disrespectful. Even if it's his choice, using money to gain romantic interest can be seen as unethical if it's the primary method. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances here.\n"
