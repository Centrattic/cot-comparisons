I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls, so he started using his wealth to do so. He posts about his condo, cars, trips on Instagram, which increases his followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. However, when he told a friend about this strategy, she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Using money to attract others can be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. The user is essentially using his wealth as a tool for validation and relationships, which might be considered shallow or using others. However, he's not lying about his wealth; he genuinely has it. The problem is if he's being deceptive about his intentions, but he's upfront about his strategy to his friend. \n\nAnother angle: If he's honest with the girls about his wealth and his intentions, maybe it's okay. But he's not clear on that. The girls might be interested for the wrong reasons, or he's leading them on without genuine connection. Also, using social media to showcase wealth to attract attention can be seen as a way to exploit one's status. \n\nHis friend's reaction is interesting. She was shocked and called him an asshole, maybe because she sees it as using others for his wealth, which is disrespectful. But the user argues he's different with his friends, helping them pay tuition and being normal. So there's a contrast between his two personas. \n\nIs it wrong to use one's resources to attract partners? That's subjective. Some might say it's fine if it's not deceitful. Others might argue it's objectifying women or treating them as commodities. Also, if the girls are aware and willing participants, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's not being genuine, then it's a problem. \n\nThe key points: He's not being deceptive about his wealth but is using it strategically to attract others. The friend's disapproval doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong, but it does indicate potential ethical concerns. The main issue is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a case to be made that he's being inauthentic and possibly manipulative, which could be considered wrong. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's any justification for not being in the wrong. Since he's not lying about his wealth, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. However, the friend's reaction and the idea of using people for their wealth could tip it towards A.\n"
