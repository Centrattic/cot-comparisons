I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old who uses their wealth to attract women, sharing their luxury items on social media and engaging in specific behaviors to get attention. They admit it's a strategy and mention they act differently around their non-wealthy friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's superficial or manipulative, while others might say it's about personal choice and honesty. The person is upfront about their intentions with their friends, but maybe not with the women they're interacting with. The friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is seen as inauthentic or exploitative.\n\nAlso, the user mentions helping friends pay tuition and being a different person around them, which shows they have a good side. However, the main issue is the method they use to attract women. If the women are aware of their wealth and choose to engage, maybe it's a mutual agreement. But if the man is being deceptive about his intentions or the reasons behind his interactions, that's where the problem lies.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"using money\" versus \"showing off.\" If he's being honest about his wealth and the women are aware, it's their choice to engage. But the way he's approaching it\u2014strategically posting and talking about his dad's business\u2014might come off as insincere or transactional. The friend called him an asshole, indicating that such tactics are frowned upon in their social circle.\n\nEthically, authenticity in relationships is important. If he's only interested in getting girls through wealth and isn't being genuine, that's a red flag. However, if the women are equally interested in his wealth and it's a mutual understanding, then it's their choice. The line between using wealth honestly and manipulatively can be thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, the person might be in the wrong because their approach could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, even if they're not explicitly lying. The friend's reaction supports that view, and the strategy's focus on superficial displays for a specific purpose (hooking up) rather than genuine connection could be problematic.\n"
