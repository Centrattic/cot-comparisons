I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the writer is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The scenario is that he's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and switched to showing off his wealth on social media to get attention. He gets DMs from girls, dresses better, drives nicer cars, and talks about his dad's business. He also helps his friends financially and acts normally with them.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the act of using money to attract others\u2014does that inherently make him wrong? Some might say it's shallow or manipulative, but others might argue it's just a strategy. The key here is intent. He explicitly says he does this \"only to get with girls,\" which could be seen as insincere. But he also helps friends and is genuine around them, which might balance things out.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole for being a \"douche,\" implying she found his approach inauthentic or exploitative. But does that mean he's wrong? If he's being honest about his methods with those he dates, maybe not. However, the article doesn't mention if he's upfront with the girls he's interested in. If he's leading them on with false pretenses, that's a problem. But if they're aware of his wealth and choose to engage, it's their choice.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of self-confidence. If he's not good-looking, maybe he's compensating for that. But using money as a tool in dating isn't uncommon. It's a matter of perception. Some might view it as honest about his value (money), while others see it as superficial.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on relationships. If he's forming connections based on wealth rather than genuine compatibility, the relationships might lack depth. But again, the girls in the DMs are the ones initiating, so it's their choice to engage. The user's friends don't seem to mind his behavior, so maybe there's a cultural or social context where this is acceptable.\n\nThere's also the issue of authenticity. He presents a different side of himself to attract girls, which could be seen as inauthentic. But isn't everyone a bit performative in dating? The line is blurry here. If he's not hiding his wealth but using it as a tool, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if he's being deceptive about his intentions or his character, that could be problematic.\n\nThe friend's judgment might stem from her own values. She might think he's using his wealth to manipulate, but unless he's actively lying or exploiting, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. The key is whether he's respecting the girls' autonomy. If they're aware and still engage, he's not wrong. If he's leading them to believe he's genuine when he's not, that's a different story.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether his actions are honest and respectful. Since the article doesn't indicate deception, just a strategic use of wealth, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might still argue that using money as a primary tool for dating is ethically questionable. The friend's reaction is subjective, so her judgment isn't definitive. Therefore, the answer could be B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
