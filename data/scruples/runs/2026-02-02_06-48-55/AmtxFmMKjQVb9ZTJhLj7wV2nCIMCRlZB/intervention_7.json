I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract women. The situation is that he's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and he uses social media to show off his wealth to get attention from girls. He's been doing this for a year, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which can be seen as manipulative. But is that inherently wrong? Some people might argue that it's just a strategy, similar to how people might use other traits or interests to attract partners. However, there's a line when it comes to being deceptive or only showing a certain side of oneself to achieve personal goals.\n\nThe author mentions that he acts differently around his friends, being more down-to-earth. That suggests he's presenting a different persona to different groups. The key issue here is whether using wealth to attract women is deceptive or if it's a genuine way to connect. If the women he's interested in are primarily interested in his wealth, then there's mutual benefit, but if he's hiding his true self, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is significant. She called him an asshole, which indicates that his friend perceives his actions as inconsiderate or unethical. But friends might have different standards, so her opinion isn't the only factor. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author is honest about his motivations, which is to get with girls. That transparency with himself is there, but he's not being transparent to the women he's interacting with. If the women know he's wealthy and are attracted to that, maybe they're aware of his intentions. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not during interactions, that's a different story.\n\nSocietal views on using wealth in dating vary. Some might see it as fair game, others as using money to compensate for other perceived shortcomings. The question is whether this is a form of manipulation or just a strategy. If the author isn't lying about his wealth and is upfront about his status when he's presenting it, then maybe it's not deceitful. But if he's leading women on with false intentions or pretending to be genuinely interested in them beyond his wealth, that's where it crosses into being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on others. The author is helping his friends with tuition, which shows he's not entirely self-centered. However, his actions in the dating context might affect how others perceive relationships and wealth. If he's exploiting his wealth to get what he wants without regard for the women's feelings or motivations, that's problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author is using wealth strategically to attract women, which could be seen as manipulative and inauthentic. The fact that he's presenting a different side of himself for different audiences might indicate a lack of integrity. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
