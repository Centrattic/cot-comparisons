I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family. He mentions using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also mentions dressing better, driving his nicer car to catch attention, and talking about his dad's business to impress them. However, he says he's a normal guy with friends who aren't wealthy and helps them pay tuition. He acts differently around them, driving a Honda and going to student bars. He told a friend about his strategy, and she was shocked, calling him a douche.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no). I need to evaluate the situation based on moral or social norms.\n\nLet's consider the key points. The main issue is using wealth to attract romantic interest. Is that inherently wrong? It's a gray area. People often use various attributes (looks, status, money) to attract others, which is part of social dynamics. However, the question is about whether this is unethical or asshole behavior.\n\nThe author is being honest about his tactics. He's not lying to the women; he's presenting his wealth as part of his lifestyle. However, some might argue that using wealth to attract partners is superficial or manipulative. The friend's reaction suggests she finds it unethical, but others might see it as just a strategy.\n\nAnother point is that the author is supporting his friends financially, which shows he's not entirely self-centered. He's acting as a different person with friends, which could indicate he's aware of the different social contexts. However, the core issue is whether using wealth to appeal to women is wrong.\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. Some might say it's fine\u2014everyone presents their best self. Others might consider it inauthentic or using materialism as a crutch. Since the author isn't harming anyone physically and is honest about his intentions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might still see it as unethical to manipulate others with wealth.\n\nThe friend's judgment is subjective, and the act itself isn't illegal. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a strong argument for A as well. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just if others disapprove. Since there's no harm beyond possible superficial motivations, I lean toward B.\n"
