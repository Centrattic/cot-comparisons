I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by breaking down the scenario. The author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's a trust fund kid, not good looking, and finds it hard to attract girls. He's been using social media to post about his condo, cars, watches, and trips, which increased his followers and DMs from attractive girls. He dresses better and uses his nicer car to catch their eyes. He goes to trendy places and talks about his dad's business and his plans to join next year. He admits he sounds like a douche but says he only does this to meet girls. Otherwise, he's a normal guy, helping his friends pay tuition and being different with them, using his Honda and student bars.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. People often have different opinions on this. Some might say it's not wrong because people can use their assets however they choose. Others might argue that it's manipulative or inauthentic, which could be problematic in relationships. \n\nHe tells a friend about this strategy, and she's shocked, calling him the biggest asshole. That's a strong reaction. Her shock might indicate that she perceives it as deceptive or unethical. The key here is the intent. He's using money as a tool to attract girls, which could be seen as using materialism to manipulate perceptions. Even if he's genuine otherwise, the method of using wealth to appear more attractive could be considered wrong if it's leading to insincere interactions.\n\nAnother angle is the aspect of honesty. If he's presenting a fake persona online, then meeting girls through that facade and later being someone else might be lying. Relationships require trust and authenticity, and if he's not being truthful about his motivations or his character, that's a problem. Also, the fact that he's helping friends financially while presenting a different image might be seen as a double standard, but it's not necessarily wrong in itself. \n\nHowever, the act of using money to attract partners is often frowned upon because it implies that he's valuing material possessions over genuine connection. Even if he's not lying about his wealth (since he has it), the way he's using it could be perceived as using money to compensate for his perceived lack of other qualities. That might make the relationships he forms based on superficial criteria rather than real compatibility.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girls who DM him are interested in him because of his lifestyle and they're aware of his intentions, maybe it's a mutual attraction. But the problem is he's not being upfront about his strategy. When he told his friend, she was shocked, which suggests that he didn't mention this approach before. So, the deception in his online presence and the insincerity in his interactions with the girls could be the main issues here.\n\nAlso, the question of consent and mutual understanding. If the girls are being approached because they think he's a \"trust fund guy,\" but he's actually using money as a tool to attract them, maybe they wouldn't be interested in him if they knew the real reason. That could be exploiting their desires for material things, which is unethical.\n\nBut then again, the author is not lying about his actual wealth. He is wealthy, so showcasing his assets isn't technically a lie. However, the motivation behind it is to attract girls, which could be seen as using his wealth as a means to an end, possibly objectifying women by assuming they are only interested in his money. This might not be fair to the girls, as it could lead to relationships that are based on financial appeal rather than mutual respect and genuine interest.\n\nIn terms of the friend's reaction, she might feel betrayed because he wasn't honest with her about his approach, or she might think it's inconsiderate to use this method. His friends aren't wealthy, so the contrast between his behavior and theirs might also play a role in how this is perceived. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a form of game-playing, which is common in dating but can be problematic if it's manipulative. If the girls are being drawn in by his wealth and not by his actual personality, then the relationships might not be healthy or sustainable. \n\nIn summary, the debate here is about authenticity and ethical use of personal resources. If he's being inauthentic and exploiting his wealth to attract women under false pretenses, then he could be in the wrong. If he's just showcasing his genuine lifestyle and the girls are interested for that (even if it's superficial), then maybe not. But the key points are the insincerity in his interactions and the potential exploitation of women's interest in his wealth.\n"
