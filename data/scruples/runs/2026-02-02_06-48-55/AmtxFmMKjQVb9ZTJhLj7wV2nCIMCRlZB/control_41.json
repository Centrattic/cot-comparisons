I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family, part of a trust fund. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started using social media to showcase his wealth by posting about his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls\" saying hi. He's been doing this for a year. He dresses better, takes his nicer car out more, and goes to trendy places, talking about his dad's business and his future involvement. He admits he sounds like a douche but only does this to get with girls. Otherwise, he's a \"normal guy\" with friends who aren't wealthy. He helps them pay tuition, and when he's with them, he drives a Honda and goes to student bars. He told a friend about his methods, and she was shocked, calling him an asshole/douche.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (Answer A or B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. He's using his wealth to attract women, which could be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. However, he's honest with the women about his intentions? Well, not exactly. He's presenting a certain image through social media and in interactions. If he's not being genuine, that's a problem. But does that make him in the wrong? Or is he just taking advantage of his resources to improve his social standing?\n\nAlso, when he told his friend, she was shocked. But maybe his friends don't know the extent of his wealth, so he's being deceptive with them as well? He helps them with tuition, but maybe that's part of his image or genuine. The key point is whether using wealth to attract women is inherently wrong. It's a common critique in society that showing off wealth can be superficial, but is it morally wrong? It depends on the intent and the impact.\n\nIf the women are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him because of that, then they're making a choice. However, if he's misleading them about his character, that's different. The author says he's a different person when with friends, but when with the girls, he's using his wealth to impress. So he's presenting a false persona to the women. That could be considered inauthentic and possibly manipulative, which might be unethical. \n\nOn the other hand, people often present their best selves in social situations. Showing off assets isn't illegal, but the question is about being in the wrong in a moral sense. The friend's reaction suggests that his actions are seen as inconsiderate or unethical. Also, the use of money to attract women could be seen as treating them as objects or reducing their interest to his wealth. However, the women are the ones initiating contact, so it's a two-way street. \n\nI think the key here is the intent and the deception. If he's being deceptive about his motivations or his true self, that's problematic. But if he's just using his resources and being honest, maybe not. However, the user admits he's doing it solely to get with girls, which might imply he's not being genuine. So, in that case, he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
