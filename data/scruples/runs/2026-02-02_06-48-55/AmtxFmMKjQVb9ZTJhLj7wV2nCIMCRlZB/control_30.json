I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, etc. on social media. He's also helping his friends with tuition but is being a different person when he's with them. He told one friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using wealth to attract partners might be seen as transactional or inauthentic. If he's being deceptive by putting on a fa\u00e7ade to impress girls, that's problematic. However, some might argue that it's his personal choice how he presents himself, especially if it's not hurting others directly. \n\nHe's also being a supportive friend by helping with tuition and acting normally around them. But when it comes to dating, he's using his wealth as a tool. The key points here are deception, authenticity, and the impact on others. \n\nIf he's not honest about his intentions, that could be seen as manipulative. However, if the girls he's attracting are okay with the setup and he's honest with them later, then maybe it's not wrong. But the problem is that he's presenting a curated version of himself, which might mislead others. Also, his friend's reaction suggests that the strategy is viewed negatively, implying that others see it as unethical.\n\nAnother angle: is it wrong to use your resources to enhance your social life? If someone uses their good looks or talents to attract others, society often sees that as acceptable. So using money in a similar way might be a matter of perception. However, the fact that he's being inauthentic could be the main issue here. \n\nHe also mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. That adds context but doesn't necessarily justify the behavior. The core of the problem is whether being upfront about his intentions matters. If he's not honest about his approach from the start, that's misleading. But if he's truthful once they get to know him better, maybe it's just a strategy without deceit. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a sign that others might perceive this as insincere or exploitative. The author is essentially using his wealth as a social tool, which some might view as shallow or shallow. However, whether that's wrong depends on cultural and personal values. In some contexts, showing off wealth is a common social strategy.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his approach is inauthentic and uses materialism as a means to an end, which can be seen as manipulative. However, there's a counterargument that it's his personal life and he's not harming anyone. But the act of deception and the judgment from his friend suggests that there's an ethical issue here.\n"
