I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. First, I need to understand the situation fully. The author is a 22-year-old with a trust fund, not good-looking, and struggling to get dates. They started using social media to showcase their wealth\u2014posting about their condo, cars, trips. This increased their followers and DMs from girls. They also dress better, take their nicer car out, and talk about their dad's business to impress. They mentioned they're a different person around their non-wealthy friends, helping with tuition and acting more normal. After telling a friend, she called them an asshole for being a douche.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should consider a few angles. First, using wealth to attract others could be seen as manipulative or using materialism as a tool for relationships, which some might find unethical. The author is being inauthentic, presenting a version of themselves that's all about wealth when they're not \"good-looking.\" That might be seen as deceptive. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is viewed negatively. However, others might argue that it's not illegal or against any moral law\u2014everyone uses their strengths to attract partners. The author isn't lying about their wealth, just emphasizing it. Also, they're helping friends financially, which could balance their actions. But the question is about being in the wrong in terms of using money to get girls. \n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest with their friends about their approach, even if it's superficial. The problem might be in the manipulation or deception. If they're not hiding their wealth but just leveraging it, is that inherently wrong? It's a bit like someone using their looks or other traits to attract others. However, some might argue that using wealth in this way exploits others' material desires. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a key point. She called them an asshole, indicating that some people see this as wrong. But others might not. The author's justification is that they're not good-looking and need to use their resources. But does that make it okay? It's a personal choice, but society often frowns on using money as a primary dating strategy because it can be seen as shallow or transactional. \n\nAlso, the author is being two-faced\u2014acting different around friends vs. when trying to attract girls. That duality could be seen as insincere, contributing to the perception of being a douche. The act of \"spilling the beans\" to the friend might have made her realize the inauthenticity, leading to her negative reaction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no clear right or wrong, but the question is about societal judgment. The AITA format usually reflects what the community thinks. The community here is likely to side with the friend's perspective, considering the author's actions as using wealth to manipulate, thus making them at fault. So the answer is probably A.\n"
