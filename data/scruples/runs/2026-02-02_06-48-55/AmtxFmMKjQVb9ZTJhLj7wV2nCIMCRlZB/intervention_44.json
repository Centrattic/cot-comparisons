I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family is using his money to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media and in person. He's been doing this for a year, changes his appearance and behavior when trying to meet girls, and admitted to a friend who was shocked and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The guy is being upfront about his intentions with the girls, right? He's not hiding his wealth, he's just using it as a tool to attract attention. But is that manipulation? Maybe. People often use various tactics to attract others, like dressing a certain way or talking about their interests. But using money specifically can be seen as inauthentic or superficial. The key question is whether he's being deceptive. If he's honest about his intentions and the girls are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him, maybe it's not wrong. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not just to get dates, that could be manipulative.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The friend he told was shocked and criticized him. That suggests that his approach is viewed negatively by others, which might imply that there's something ethically wrong with it. But social norms vary. Some might see it as a game, others as exploitative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's a different person with his friends, which could indicate a lack of authenticity in his interactions with the girls. If he's presenting a false self, that's a form of deception. However, in dating, people often highlight their best traits, so where's the line between being genuine and strategic?\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. If his behavior is causing harm or making others uncomfortable, that's a red flag. But if the girls are willingly engaging without coercion, maybe it's not his fault. The ethical dilemma here is balancing personal freedom to pursue relationships in a way that works for them versus societal expectations of honesty and authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the use of wealth as a primary tool for attraction could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, especially if it's leading to shallow or insincere relationships. The friend's negative reaction supports the idea that others might view this as wrong. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
