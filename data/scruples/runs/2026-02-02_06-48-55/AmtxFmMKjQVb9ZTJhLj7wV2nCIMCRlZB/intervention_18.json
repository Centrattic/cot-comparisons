I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who's using his money and status to attract women on social media. He's posting about his condo, cars, trips, etc., to get attention from \"hot girls,\" and he's open about doing this for romantic purposes. He also mentioned that he's different with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and acting more like a regular guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is being honest with himself about his intentions, but is that enough? He's using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which can be seen as manipulative. The question is whether it's wrong to use one's resources in this way for personal gain in relationships. \n\nThen there's the reaction from his friend. She called him an asshole and a douche, which suggests that others see this as inconsiderate or disrespectful. Using money to attract partners can be viewed as objectifying others, implying that the women are only interested in his wealth rather than him as a person. This could lead to superficial relationships and potentially hurt others if they later feel used.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his choice how he uses his resources, and if the women are interested, it's mutual. But the issue arises when it's done insincerely or with the sole intent of using wealth as a lure. The author's admission that he's doing it just to get with girls, rather than genuinely sharing his life, shows a lack of authenticity, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping his friends financially and acts normally around them indicates he's aware of different social contexts. Yet, his method with women is calculated. This duality might be perceived as hypocritical or inauthentic, especially since he's presenting a curated image online. The friend's shock and disapproval suggest that this approach is frowned upon by others, possibly for ethical reasons.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual respect are important. If the author is upfront with the women about his wealth and intentions, maybe it's not inherently wrong. But since he's using social media to attract them under the guise of sharing his life rather than being transparent from the start, it could be seen as misleading. The key here is the intention and the method. Using money to attract partners through deception or manipulation is generally considered unethical, as it doesn't foster genuine connections.\n\nTherefore, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical stance is that he's using his wealth in a way that could be seen as exploiting others, which makes him at fault. The answer would be A.\n"
