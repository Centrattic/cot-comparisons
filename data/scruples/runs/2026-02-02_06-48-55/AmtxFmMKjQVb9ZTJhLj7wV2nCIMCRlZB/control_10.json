I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The person is a 22-year-old who uses their wealth to attract girls by showing off their money on social media. They mention that they dress better, use nice cars, and talk about their dad's business. They also help friends pay for tuition but keep their true motives hidden when interacting with girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is whether using wealth to attract romantic partners is wrong. There are different perspectives on this. On one hand, people have the right to use their resources to enhance their social life. On the other hand, some might argue that it's inconsiderate or manipulative to be insincere about one's intentions in relationships.\n\nThe person's friends don't know about their wealth, and they present a different side of themselves in social situations. This duality is a point to consider. They're not being honest about their motivations when engaging with the girls. Honesty in relationships is often valued, so maybe the act of not being genuine could be seen as a problem.\n\nAlso, the friend who found out was shocked and called the person an asshole. That suggests that the action is frowned upon by others, which might indicate that the author is in the wrong. However, others might argue that it's their personal life and they have the freedom to date whoever they want. \n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. If the girls are only interested because of the money, then the relationships are based on materialism. But if the author is upfront about their intentions, perhaps even if it's shallow, it's still honest in a way. However, the author is using a false persona to attract them, which could be deceptive.\n\nThe fact that they help their friends pay tuition and act normally with them shows they have a good side, but the deceit in their dating approach is the main issue. Deception, even in dating, is often considered wrong. People generally expect authenticity in relationships. So, the author is being inauthentic and possibly exploiting their wealth to gain attention, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nIn conclusion, while using wealth to attract others isn't inherently wrong, the dishonesty and insincerity involved make the author's actions ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
