I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey're a 22-year-old guy with a trust fund and not very good looking. They mention that they've been using their wealth to attract girls by posting pictures of their condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram. Their followers increased, and they get a lot of DMs from \"hot girls.\" They dress better, drive their nicer car, go to trendy places, and talk about their dad's business and their future plans in it. They admit they sound like a douche but say they're only doing this to get with girls. They also help two friends pay for tuition, act normally with them, and drive a Honda when they hang out. They told one friend about their strategy, and the friend was shocked, calling them an asshole/douche.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is using their wealth to attract romantic attention, which some might see as inauthentic or manipulative. They're presenting a certain image to appeal to others, which isn't their usual self. This could be seen as deceptive because they're not being their true self when trying to attract girls. \n\nHowever, others might argue that people present different versions of themselves in social situations, especially if they're in a position where they can leverage their resources. It's also possible that the girls they attract are aware of their wealth and are interested in that aspect. The author does mention that they're a different person when with friends who aren't wealthy, suggesting they don't always act this way. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called them the biggest asshole/douche, implying that she views this behavior as exploitative or shallow. But the friend might not understand the context fully, especially since the author is helping others financially. \n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author is clear that the only reason they're doing this is to get with girls, which could be seen as using their wealth as a tool for romantic gain rather than genuine connection. This might be considered inauthentic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say it's their way of navigating the dating scene given their self-perceived limitations (not good-looking). They're not stealing from others or harming anyone; they're just using what they have to attract partners. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether it's wrong to use wealth to attract others. In many societies, people do use their status and possessions to attract partners, which is a common phenomenon. However, if it's done insincerely or with the sole purpose of manipulation, some might find it unethical. \n\nThe fact that the author is being \"a different person\" when with their friends versus when trying to attract girls suggests a lack of authenticity. That could be seen as a problem, especially if the girls aren't aware they're being targeted for the author's wealth. \n\nAlso, the author's own perception of themselves (\"I know I sound like a huge douche\") shows they feel some guilt or awareness that their actions might be seen as shallow. \n\nIn conclusion, while using wealth to attract attention isn't illegal, the ethical judgment might depend on the perspective. If the author is being deceptive or manipulative, then yes, they might be in the wrong. If it's just a social strategy without harm, maybe not. But since the question is about being in the wrong morally, the consensus might lean towards A (yes) because it's about authenticity and intent in relationships.\n"
