I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is someone who's not considered good-looking and is leveraging their family's money to get attention from women. They post about their possessions on Instagram, dress up, drive nicer cars, and talk about their dad's business. They admit they're only doing this to get with girls and are seen as a different person by their friends.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a question about authenticity. The author is using material displays to attract attention, which might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. People might argue that building relationships based on wealth, especially when it's not one's own (since it's a trust fund), is exploiting others for superficial reasons. Also, the fact that they're presenting a different version of themselves to get what they want could be seen as insincere.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that it's their choice how they want to present themselves and seek relationships. If the girls are aware of their wealth and still engage, maybe it's a mutual decision. However, the author is being deceptive in their approach, not being genuine, which can be problematic in relationships. The friend's reaction also points out that this behavior is seen as inconsiderate or arrogant.\n\nThe key points here are deception and using wealth as a tool for personal gain in relationships. While everyone has the right to seek companionship, doing so through inauthentic means and relying on materialism can be considered unethical. The author's actions might also set a precedent of valuing wealth over genuine connections, which society often frowns upon.\n\nSo, considering the manipulation of image and intent, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. They're not just being honest about their approach, and it's about using their status to get what they want rather than forming real connections.\n"
