I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that he's a 22-year-old with a lot of money, not good-looking, and he's using social media to showcase his wealth to attract women. He mentions dressing better, driving his nicer car, talking about his dad's business, and that he's been doing this for a year. He also helps his friends pay tuition and acts normally around them. He told one friend his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, using money to attract others can be seen as superficial or transactional. But he's not offering money directly; he's showcasing his wealth through social media and lifestyle. That's a bit different. People often use social media to present their best selves, so maybe that's not inherently wrong. But the intent here is clearly to attract women, which might make others uncomfortable.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. If he's presenting a wealthier, more successful image to attract women but isn't the same in his personal life with friends, is that deceptive? He does admit he's a \"different person when I'm with them.\" If he's being dishonest about his true self to women, that could be manipulative. Women might be attracted to the image he's projecting, not his real personality, which could lead to issues if they find out later. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She called him an asshole because she was shocked he was using his wealth strategically. That suggests that others might view this as inauthentic or exploitative. However, the friend is not a romantic interest, so her perspective is limited. \n\nHe's also helping friends with tuition, which shows he's not entirely self-serving, but the question is about his actions towards the women he's trying to attract. The issue here is whether using wealth as a tool to attract women is acceptable. Some might argue that it's just a strategy, and everyone uses different tactics. Others might see it as shallow or objectifying, treating women as if they can be bought or are only interested in money. \n\nAnother angle: if the women he's interacting with are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him because of it, is that their choice? But if he's being deceptive by not being honest about his motivations, that's a problem. However, the post doesn't mention deception in the interactions; he's just using his wealth as a tool, not lying about his intentions. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's a trust fund kid might make some people view his actions as privileged, thinking he's exploiting his wealth in a way that others can't. But others might say that's just how the world works, and people use their strengths. \n\nSo, putting this all together, is he in the wrong? If he's being honest about his intentions in his interactions with the women, then maybe not. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not (like not actually being interested in building genuine connections), then that's the issue. The post says he's \"only do[ing] this to get with girls,\" which implies that his interest in them is purely for sexual purposes, not for genuine relationships. That could be seen as unethical, as it's using others for his own desires without the intent to form a real connection. \n\nOn the other hand, if the women are equally interested in his wealth and are okay with that, then it's a mutual exchange. However, the problem arises if he's being deceptive or manipulative. Since he's presenting a certain image to attract them, but isn't the same person in his personal life, it's a form of inauthenticity. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's using his wealth as a tool to attract women, possibly being inauthentic, and his primary goal is just to \"get with girls,\" which could be seen as exploiting his position for personal gain without genuine intent to form meaningful relationships. The friend's reaction supports that others might view this as unethical or inconsiderate.\n"
