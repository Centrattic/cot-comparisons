I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's using his wealth to attract girls by showing off his stuff on Instagram and changing his behavior when he's around them. He's also being a different person with his friends, not showing off his wealth there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using money to attract people is inherently wrong. Flattery or showing off material possessions to impress someone isn't illegal, but morally, some might see it as inauthentic or manipulative. The key points here are deception and intent. The author is presenting a different version of himself to the girls, focusing on wealth and status to attract them. That could be seen as misleading because he's not being his true self when getting to know them. If the girls are interested in him for his money rather than who he is, that could lead to issues later. Also, his friend was shocked when he revealed this, suggesting that even his close friends see this behavior as inauthentic or inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that everyone presents different aspects of themselves in social settings. Maybe he's not lying, just emphasizing his wealth because that's what he believes works. However, the fact that he's consciously using this strategy to get girls might be the main issue. It's about using wealth as a tool rather than being genuine. The author's friends don't know about this strategy until recently, which might indicate a lack of integrity in his social interactions. Also, helping his friends pay tuition and being a different person with them shows that he can be genuine in some contexts, which contrasts with his approach to dating. This duality might be seen as hypocritical.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many people value authenticity in relationships. If someone is only interested in the other person's money, that's generally frowned upon. But if the girls are aware of his wealth and still choose to be with him, does that change the perspective? The problem arises if the author isn't transparent about his intentions or if he's leading the girls on by creating a false impression. The post mentions that he talks about his dad's business and future role, which could be part of the image he's projecting. If the girls are interested in his wealth and not in his actual personality, the author is exploiting his financial status to gain attention, which some would consider unethical.\n\nThe friend's reaction is another point. She called him an asshole, indicating that his behavior is not socially acceptable in her eyes. The friends' shock suggests that even though he's generous with them, his method of attracting girls is seen as deceitful. So, even if he's not committing a crime, the social judgment here is negative. The key question is whether using wealth to attract romantic partners is inherently wrong. While it's not illegal, the ethical aspect depends on the intent and whether it's deceptive. Since the author is consciously using this strategy to get girls and isn't being his true self, many would argue that he's in the wrong for being inauthentic and possibly manipulative in his dating approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
