I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family. He's using his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his condo, cars, watches, trips on Instagram. His followers increased, and he gets DMs from \"hot girls.\" He's dressing better, driving his nicer cars to catch girls' attention. He goes to trendy places and talks about his dad's business and his plans to join next year. He admits he's only doing this to get with girls. When he told a friend about this strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The main issue here is using wealth to attract partners. Is that inherently wrong? Some might see it as manipulative or insincere, using material possessions to gain attention. Others might argue that it's about confidence and self-presentation, and as long as he's honest about his intentions, it's his choice.\n\nHe mentions that he's not good-looking, which complicates things. Maybe he's compensating for other perceived shortcomings. But using money to attract others could be seen as transactional. However, he's not offering money in exchange for relationships; rather, he's showing off his wealth to attract attention. \n\nHe helps his friends financially, which might suggest he's not a bad person. He's different with his friends, taking his Honda and going to normal bars. That shows he's not pretending in all areas of his life. But when it comes to dating, he's using his wealth as a tool. \n\nThe friend's reaction was negative, calling him an asshole. That could indicate that others see his approach as inauthentic or manipulative. But people's opinions vary. Some might think it's a smart strategy, leveraging what they have. Others might find it shallow.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to use one's resources to attract partners? It's a gray area. If he's being honest about his intentions and the girls are aware of his wealth and still engage, maybe it's consensual. But if he's being deceptive or leading them to believe he's more interested in them than he is, that's a problem. However, the question is whether using money to get girls is wrong, not whether the girls are being deceived. \n\nThe key points are: using wealth as a tool to attract attention, being transparent with friends (but maybe not with the girls he's interested in), and the perception from others. \n\nI think the debate here is about authenticity and motives. If someone is only interested in getting dates and using wealth as a means to that end, without genuine interest in the other person, that could be seen as problematic. However, if the girls are also interested in his wealth and they're both on the same page, it's not inherently wrong. The problem arises if there's a mismatch in intentions or if people are being misled.\n\nSince the author admits he's doing this solely to get with girls, and the friend's reaction is negative, it's possible that the author is in the wrong from a moral standpoint where sincerity is valued. But others might argue that it's his strategy and not hurting anyone as long as it's consensual. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on societal norms and personal ethics. In many cases, people might consider using wealth to attract partners as shallow or manipulative, hence AITA (Am I the Asshole) would lean towards \"Yes\" because the person is using a superficial or transactional approach to relationships. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I need to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, if it's about self-expression and confidence, maybe B. But given the friend's reaction and the common perception that using money to attract others is frowned upon, it's more likely A.\n"
