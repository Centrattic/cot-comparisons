I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family who's using his financial status to attract women on social media. He posts about his luxury items, drives nicer cars, and talks about his dad's business to catch girls' attention. He claims he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and acting normal. But when he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my perspective. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract others. Is it inherently wrong to use your resources to gain attention? People often use various traits or assets to attract others\u2014confidence, hobbies, intelligence, etc. Wealth is just another asset. However, there's a line when it comes to honesty and authenticity. If he's being upfront about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's misleading others about his true self, that's a problem.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not being himself when he's with the girls, implying he's using a facade. This could be manipulative. The friend's reaction suggests she found the tactic deceitful. The key here is intent and transparency. If the girls are attracted to the lifestyle and he's not hiding his wealth, maybe they're aware and okay with it. However, if he's pretending to be someone he's not and leading them on without genuine intentions, that's unethical.\n\nAlso, the part about helping his friends with tuition and acting normal with them shows he can be genuine in some contexts. But when it comes to dating, he's putting on a different persona. This duality might be seen as inauthentic. The friend's shock and the label of \"asshole/douche\" indicate a moral judgment against his approach.\n\nAnother angle: is it the author's responsibility to how others react? If he's not directly harming anyone (assuming the girls are aware and consenting), maybe it's not his fault. But the tactic of using wealth to attract could be seen as shallow or objectifying, reducing relationships to materialism. This could be considered wrong because it's not building genuine connections.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, using wealth as a tool to gain attention without genuine connection. The friend's negative reaction supports this view. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
