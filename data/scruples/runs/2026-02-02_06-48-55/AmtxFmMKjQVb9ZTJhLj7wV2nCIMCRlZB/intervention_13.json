I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. So the guy is 22, wealthy, using his money to attract girls by showcasing his stuff on Instagram, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He's helping friends with tuition but presenting a different side to them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if he's in the wrong. The question is about whether his actions are morally wrong or socially inappropriate. He's being honest with the girls he's trying to attract, right? Or is he misleading them? He's using his wealth as a tool to get their attention, which might be seen as superficial or manipulative. But he's not lying directly. He's just highlighting his wealth to impress them. However, if he's presenting himself as someone he's not, maybe that's the issue. Like, if he's pretending to be into certain things or has different values just to get girls, that could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that he helps his friends financially but shows a different side to them might be a red flag. The friend was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests some people see it as inauthentic. But is that inherently wrong? People can have different aspects of their lives. The key here is if he's being deceptive. If he's upfront about his intentions to the girls, maybe not. But if he's leading them on with false pretenses, then maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: using money to attract others can be seen as objectifying oneself or others, reducing relationships to material value. That's a common criticism. However, people do use various methods to attract partners, and wealth is a common asset. The line is between using what you have to your advantage versus being deceptive. The friend's reaction points to a moral judgment that this is inauthentic and possibly exploitative. \n\nSo the person is in the wrong (A) because he's using materialism and perhaps inauthentic behavior to attract partners, which can be seen as manipulative and disrespectful towards the girls' interests. However, some might argue that it's not wrong if he's honest about his methods. But the friend's reaction and the general social norms suggest that this approach is frowned upon, making the answer more likely A.\n"
