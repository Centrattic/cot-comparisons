I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract women. His strategy has been to showcase his wealth through social media\u2014posting about his condo, cars, watches, and trips. This led to more followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, uses his nicer car, and goes to trendy places, talking about his dad's business and his future role in it. He mentions that he's a different person when he's with his friends, helping them pay tuition and being normal. However, when he told one of his friends about his strategy, she called him an asshole for using his wealth to attract women.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about manipulation, honesty, and intentions. The author is using his wealth to attract women, which could be seen as insincere because he's not being genuine in his interactions. However, he argues that he's a different person with friends and that he's not doing this for everyone. \n\nOn one hand, using wealth to attract attention might be seen as exploiting his status for personal gain, which can be considered superficial or transactional. If he's not being honest about his intentions from the start, then it's a form of deception. On the other hand, if the women he's attracting are also interested in his wealth, then both parties might have mutual expectations. The issue here is more about whether it's wrong to use his wealth in this way, regardless of others' opinions.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that she views this as manipulative or inauthentic, which is a common criticism of \"playing the money game.\" However, the author isn't necessarily lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it to attract women. The ethical question is whether it's wrong to prioritize wealth in relationships, especially if it's done transparently. But since he's being upfront in his actions (posting about his wealth), maybe the issue is more about his intent rather than deception. However, if he's not being honest about his intentions when interacting with the women, that's another layer. \n\nHe also helps his friends financially, which could balance out his actions, but that's not directly related to the women he's trying to attract. The main issue is about using wealth as a tool to get what he wants in relationships. Some might argue that everyone uses different strategies to attract partners, and wealth is just another resource. Others might see it as inauthentic and manipulative. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a stigma around using wealth to attract others, especially if it's done with the sole intention of getting into relationships without genuine connection. The friend's judgment is a reflection of that stigma. However, the author isn't harming anyone directly, just pursuing his own interests. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative by some, but others might argue that using available resources (like wealth) to improve social standing isn't inherently wrong. The key here is whether his actions are deceptive. Since he's upfront about his wealth, but not about his intentions when approaching women, it could be considered deceptive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's using his wealth strategically to manipulate others into pursuing him, which can be seen as unethical in romantic contexts where honesty and authenticity are valued.\n"
