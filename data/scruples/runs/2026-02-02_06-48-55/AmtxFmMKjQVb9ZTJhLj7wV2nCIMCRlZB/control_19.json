I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a young man from a wealthy background using his money and social media to attract women. He's sharing his luxury items online, dressing up, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. He's also helping his friends by paying their tuition and being more down-to-earth with them. However, when he told one friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole/douche. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are using money to attract women, being honest with friends, and the friend's reaction. The author isn't necessarily lying outright; he's presenting himself in a certain way on social media to attract attention. But is that deceptive? Also, he's helping his friends financially, which shows he's not just selfish. However, when he told his friend about his tactics, she was shocked, implying she felt he was being manipulative or insincere.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethics. Using money to attract partners isn't inherently wrong if both parties are aware and okay with it. However, if there's deception involved, that's a problem. The author is being upfront in his intentions with the girls, but the method might be seen as shallow or transactional. The fact that he's a different person when with his friends suggests he's being disingenuous in social settings where the girls might expect a genuine connection.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is significant. She labeled him an asshole, which indicates that his behavior might be considered unethical or disrespectful by some standards. People often value authenticity in relationships, and using material displays to attract partners can be viewed as inauthentic, leading others to question his motives.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. He's also helping his friends, which is a positive trait. But the issue is whether using wealth as a tool to attract women is inherently wrong. It could be seen as using money as a crutch when he might lack other social skills. However, everyone has the right to pursue relationships in their own way, unless it's harmful or deceptive.\n\nThe line between using one's resources and being deceptive is blurry here. If the girls he's interested in are aware of his tactics and still choose to engage, then it's consensual. But if they're being misled into thinking he's more genuine or less materialistic than he is, that's deceptive. The author's own admission that he \"only do this to get with girls\" suggests that his primary motivation is to attract partners, which others might find shallow.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily breaking any laws, his approach could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, especially if the girls are led to believe he's more interested in genuine connections than he is. The friend's reaction supports the idea that his actions are viewed negatively by others. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
