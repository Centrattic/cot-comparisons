I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media. He admits to being a \"huge douche\" in this context but claims he's a different person with his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract others can be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The man is being transparent with himself but maybe not with others. When he told his friend, her reaction was negative, labeling him an asshole. That suggests his actions might be viewed as insincere or using his wealth as a tool for personal gain, which can be frowned upon.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: he's not harming anyone directly. He's sharing his lifestyle, which others might find appealing. People often present their best selves online, so maybe it's not inherently wrong. Also, he helps his friends by paying for their tuition, showing he's not selfish entirely.\n\nBut the key issue is using wealth as a primary tool to attract partners. Relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and genuine connection. If he's only interested in getting with girls through material displays, it could be considered shallow or using others. However, if he's honest about his intentions and isn't deceiving others, maybe it's not wrong. However, the problem arises if the women he's interacting with aren't aware of his true motives, leading to potential exploitation.\n\nThe friend's reaction indicates society might judge this behavior as inauthentic. Even if he's not breaking any laws, social norms often value sincerity in relationships. So, while he's not doing something illegal, he might be seen as ethically in the wrong for prioritizing wealth display over genuine connection. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
