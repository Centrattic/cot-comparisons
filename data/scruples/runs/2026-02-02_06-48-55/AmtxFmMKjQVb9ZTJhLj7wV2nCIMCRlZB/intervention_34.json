I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his luxury items on social media, dressing better, and going to trendy places to get attention. He tells his friend about this strategy, and she calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The main issue here is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. Manipulation or deception in relationships is often frowned upon. The author is being transparent with his friends about his methods, but when it comes to the women he's interacting with, does he present his true intentions honestly? If he's leading them to believe he's a regular guy when he's strategically using his wealth as a tool, that could be deceptive. However, if he's upfront about his intentions during dating, then it's a different story. The problem here is the lack of honesty with the women he's trying to attract. They might be drawn in by the lifestyle he presents, not by who he truly is, which is a form of using his wealth to manipulate the situation for personal gain. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. The author helps his friends pay for tuition and behaves differently when he's with them, showing he's not a bad person overall. However, using wealth to gain social capital in romantic contexts can be seen as exploitative. It's about the method rather than the outcome. The women he attracts might feel used if they realize it's all about his money. \n\nSocial norms also play a role. While some might argue that people use various tactics to attract partners, the line is crossed when it's about deception or exploiting one's resources in a manipulative way. The friend's reaction suggests that her perception is that the author is being inauthentic and using his wealth as a crutch, which is why she called him an asshole. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is being deceptive by presenting a curated image of wealth while downplaying his regular life. He's using his resources to manipulate social interactions for personal benefit without genuine transparency, which makes him in the wrong.\n"
