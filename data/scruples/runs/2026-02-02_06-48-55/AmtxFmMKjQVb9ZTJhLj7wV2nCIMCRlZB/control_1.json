I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The situation is that he's a trust fund kid who isn't good-looking and switched to showing off his money on social media to get attention. He's dressing better, driving nicer cars, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. He also helps his non-wealthy friends by paying their tuition but acts more normal around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is morally wrong. The author isn't using money to buy relationships directly, but rather to attract attention. The key question is whether using wealth to gain social advantages is unethical. Some might argue that people use their assets to attract others all the time, like through fashion or hobbies, so this isn't inherently wrong. Others might see it as inauthentic or objectifying, using money as a tool rather than genuine connection.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole for being deceptive. Deception could be a factor here if he's pretending to be someone else to get attention. However, the author claims he's just using what he has to his advantage, not necessarily lying but being strategic. The line between confidence and arrogance is thin here. \n\nAnother angle is that he's helping his friends financially, showing he's not entirely self-centered. But the method of using money to attract romantic interest might still be seen as manipulative. The key here is intent. If his sole purpose is to attract girls and he's not being honest about it, that could be problematic. However, if he's just leveraging his resources without lying, some might argue it's a personal choice.\n\nAlso, social media often involves showcasing the best aspects of life, so maybe this isn't unique. But the explicit goal of getting girls through these posts adds a layer. The friend's reaction suggests that his openness about this strategy is offensive. Maybe the issue isn't the strategy itself but the honesty in admitting it. If he's upfront with his friends, but the method is seen as using others, that's where the problem lies.\n\nIn terms of ethics, using money to attract isn't illegal, but societal views vary. Some might see it as a personal choice, others as exploiting wealth for validation. The author's actions don't harm others unless the girls are being misled. If they're aware of his wealth and choose to engage, it's their choice. But if he's being deceptive about his intentions or his true self, that's different. The post mentions he's a different person when with friends, implying he's putting on an act for girls, which could be seen as insincere.\n\nOverall, the author's actions might be in a gray area. He's not doing anything illegal, but the ethical stance depends on perspective. If the question is about moral wrongdoing, the answer could be A (wrong) because he's using money to manipulate social interactions and might be seen as inauthentic. However, others might defend it as a legitimate strategy in dating. The friend's reaction supports the idea that some find it unethical, so the answer leans towards A.\n"
