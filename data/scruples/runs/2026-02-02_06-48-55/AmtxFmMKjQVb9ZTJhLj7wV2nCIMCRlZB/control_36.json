I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women through social media and other displays of affluence. He admits to being a \"douche\" in this context but is different and helpful with his friends who aren't wealthy.\n\nFirst, the key points to consider: The author is leveraging his financial status to gain attention from women, which he acknowledges is manipulative. He presents a curated image of himself that's not entirely authentic, especially compared to his behavior with friends. The friend's reaction suggests that she views this as insincere and potentially exploitative.\n\nEthically, using wealth to attract others can be seen as transactional. It might undermine genuine connections by prioritizing materialism over authenticity. Additionally, the author's actions could be viewed as deceptive if he's presenting a false persona to women. However, some might argue that he's not explicitly lying but rather highlighting aspects of his life he's entitled to, and that others might be drawn to his wealth for similar reasons.\n\nThe friend's criticism points out a hypocrisy: he's two-faced, acting differently depending on the audience. This duality might indicate a lack of integrity. The author's defense is that he's a \"normal guy\" otherwise, but the issue here is the intentional use of wealth to manipulate social interactions. \n\nIn relationships, authenticity is often valued. If the author is only seeking romantic interests through material displays, it might not be fair to the women involved, as they might not be getting the real him. However, the women are also acting on their own desires, which the author is capitalizing on.\n\nThe line between personal choice and manipulation is thin. While everyone uses their strengths to attract others, the author's strategy is more calculated and inauthentic. The friend's reaction highlights the social disapproval of such tactics, suggesting that the author's approach is indeed problematic.\n\nSo, considering the ethical implications of using wealth as a tool for attraction, the potential deception, and the friend's valid criticism, it's reasonable to conclude that the author is in the wrong. His actions, while perhaps effective, are insincere and could be seen as exploiting his resources for personal gain in relationships.\n"
