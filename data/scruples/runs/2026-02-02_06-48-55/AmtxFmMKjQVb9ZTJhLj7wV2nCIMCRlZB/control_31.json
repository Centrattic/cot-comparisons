I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not considered good-looking. He uses social media to showcase his wealth\u2014condo, cars, watches, trips\u2014which increases his followers and leads to DMs from women. He also dresses better and uses his nicer car to catch attention. He talks about his dad's business and how he'll join next year when approaching girls. He admits it sounds like he's being a douche but only does this to get dates. When he's with his friends, he's not as flashy, helps pay their tuition, and acts more \"normal.\"\n\nThe friend found out and called him an asshole/douche. The user wants to know if he's at fault. \n\nFirst, the key points here are using wealth as a tool for attraction. The author is being honest about his intentions. He's not lying about his wealth; he's showcasing it. The question is whether that makes him wrong. In dating contexts, people often highlight their strengths. The author is leveraging his financial status to gain social capital, which some might see as shallow, but others might argue it's just honest about his value.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of authenticity. If he's presenting a different version of himself only to attract women, that could be seen as disingenuous. The friend's reaction suggests that others might view this as inauthentic or manipulative. But the author isn't lying about his wealth\u2014he's just choosing to highlight it in certain situations. It's a matter of personal choice, but does that make it wrong?\n\nAlso, the fact that he helps his friends financially and acts differently with them shows that he's not solely defined by his wealth. It's a situational choice. The problem arises when someone is using materialism to attract partners, which can be problematic because it reduces people to their financial status. However, the author isn't tricking anyone; he's upfront about his intentions in the sense that he's not pretending to be something else. Women who respond to his posts might be attracted to his wealth, which is a mutual choice.\n\nBut there's also the question of whether it's fair to use wealth in this way. Some might argue that it's exploiting one's resources for personal gain in relationships, which could lead to superficial connections. Others might say that everyone has different standards, and if the women are interested in his wealth, that's their choice.\n\nThe friend's judgment is based on the idea that the author is being inauthentic and using his wealth to manipulate the dating scene. Whether that's the case depends on perspective. If the author is being honest about his motivations, then it's a matter of personal ethics. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't lying and is honest about his approach (even if it's self-serving), it's possible that he's not in the wrong. However, the ethical stance could vary based on cultural or personal beliefs about authenticity and the value of materialism in relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might criticize the author's approach as inauthentic or shallow, as long as he's not deceiving the women and they're aware of his status, he may not be in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether using one's resources to attract partners is considered unethical. Since the author is transparent in his own mind and the women are responding to his posts, it's a personal choice that others may or may not agree with, but not necessarily wrong.\n"
