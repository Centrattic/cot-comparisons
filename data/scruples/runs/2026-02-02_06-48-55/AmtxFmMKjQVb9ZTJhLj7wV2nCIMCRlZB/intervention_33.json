I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old male from a wealthy family who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's being honest with his friends, but when he told one of them his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author isn't using illegal methods, but he's being deceptive in his social interactions. He's presenting himself as more affluent and successful to attract women, which might be seen as inauthentic. But is that inherently wrong? People often highlight their strengths in social settings, but when it's a deliberate ploy to manipulate others' perceptions for romantic gain, it could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty with friends. He told one friend about his tactics, and she reacted negatively. That suggests he's aware that his actions might be viewed as unethical or inconsiderate. The fact that he's a \"different person\" with friends compared to how he presents online adds another layer. It shows a split in his behavior, which might indicate he's not proud of the tactics he uses to attract women.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the women. If they're being attracted purely by material displays, are they being led on? The author isn't lying about his wealth but is using it strategically. However, if the women later find out, they might feel used. The question is whether using wealth as a tool for attraction is respectful or if it's a form of manipulation.\n\nAlso, the author is helping friends pay tuition, which might be seen as a positive trait. But that doesn't negate the potential issue with his dating approach. The friend's reaction (\"biggest asshole\") is a strong indicator that society might judge his actions harshly.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: deception in presentation, manipulation for personal gain, and the friend's negative reaction all point towards the author being in the wrong. Even though there's no legal wrongdoing, the ethical aspect is questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
