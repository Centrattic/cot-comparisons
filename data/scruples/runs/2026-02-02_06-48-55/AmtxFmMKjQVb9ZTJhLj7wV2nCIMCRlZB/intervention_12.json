I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about using wealth to attract girls by showcasing expensive items on social media and being different in other aspects. The person's friend called them an asshole after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue here is whether using one's wealth to attract romantic attention is morally wrong. The person admits they're doing it solely to get girls, which might come off as manipulative or insincere. They also mention that they act differently around their non-wealthy friends, which could be seen as two-faced. \n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She was shocked and called them an asshole, indicating that she finds the behavior unethical or inconsiderate. However, others might argue that it's their choice how they use their money, and if it's not hurting anyone, maybe it's not wrong. But the act of being deceptive or inauthentic in relationships is a red flag. The person is presenting a curated image that might mislead others, which can lead to issues if the relationships aren't based on genuine connections. \n\nAlso, the person is aware they're not good-looking and uses their wealth as a compensatory tactic. This could be seen as using materialism to cover up insecurities, which might not be respectful to others. The fact that they're helping friends with tuition shows they have a good side, but the method of attracting partners is questionable. \n\nSo, considering the deceptiveness and potential for exploitation, the person might be in the wrong. They're using their wealth to gain attention in a way that's not authentic, which can be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
