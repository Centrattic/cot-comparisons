I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The scenario is that the author is a trust fund kid who uses his wealth to show off on social media, gets attention from girls, and then when caught, a friend calls him an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using money to attract others. The author is being honest with the girls about his intentions, but is it deceptive? He's not pretending to be someone else; he's highlighting his wealth, which is a real part of him. However, people might argue that using money to attract others is shallow or manipulative. On the other hand, if someone is using their wealth to gain attention, and the girls are interested in that, it's a mutual choice. But when he told his friend, she was shocked and criticized him, which makes me think about societal expectations.\n\nAnother angle: the author is helping his friends financially. That might show he isn't just all about money. But the main issue is his approach with the girls. Is it wrong to use your resources to attract others? Maybe not inherently, but if it's done with the sole intention of manipulation without genuine interest, some might see it as inauthentic. However, attraction can be subjective. Some people are drawn to wealth, others are not. The author isn't lying; he's being honest about his wealth. But maybe the problem is that he's using it as a tool rather than forming genuine connections. \n\nThe friend's reaction is negative, calling him an asshole, which suggests that in her view, this behavior is unethical. The author's actions might be seen as exploiting his wealth to gain social advantages, which some people disapprove of. However, others might say that it's up to individuals to choose how they present themselves in dating. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, using money to attract partners isn't illegal, but it can be considered morally questionable by some standards. The key factors are intent and honesty. Since the author isn't hiding his wealth and is upfront about his intentions when engaging with the girls (as implied), he's not being deceptive. However, his method of using material displays to attract attention might be seen as inauthentic or selfish by others. \n\nThe friend's judgment might stem from a belief that such behavior is shallow or that it undermines genuine relationships. But if the girls are attracted to his wealth and the author isn't misleading them, then it's a matter of mutual interest. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's not deceiving anyone, but the ethical perspective can vary. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) from the friend's perspective and societal norms that value authenticity and genuine connections. However, if we consider that the author isn't lying and it's a personal choice, maybe it's not in the wrong. But the friend's strong negative reaction suggests that the author's actions are seen as unethical. Given the context, the answer is A.\n"
