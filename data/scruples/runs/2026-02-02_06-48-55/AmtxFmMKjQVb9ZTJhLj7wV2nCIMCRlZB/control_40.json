I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is using his wealth to attract girls by showing off his possessions on social media, dressing better, driving nice cars, and talking about his dad's business. He's doing this specifically to get with girls, but he's a different person with his friends. When he told a friend about this strategy, she called him a douche.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being honest about his intentions, but is that manipulation? He's not lying about his wealth, just using it to attract attention. However, the question is whether it's wrong to use money to get dates. Some might say it's superficial or insincere, but others might argue that people can be attracted to wealth, and it's not inherently wrong if he's not lying about who he is.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. She was shocked and called him an asshole. But maybe she's judging him based on her own values. Is it the author's fault that he's using his resources in a way others might not approve of? He's not forcing anyone; the girls are choosing to message him based on what they see. However, if he's being deceptive about his intentions or misrepresenting himself, that could be an issue. But the author says he's only doing this for dating and is a normal guy otherwise.\n\nAnother angle: the author is helping his friends pay tuition and acts normally with them. That shows he's not just using money for selfish reasons. But the main issue is whether using wealth to attract partners is unethical. It's a common critique in society to look down on people who \"buy\" attention, but there's also the argument that people have different preferences in partners.\n\nSo, is it wrong? If the author isn't lying and the girls are interested in him for his money, then he's not in the wrong for being honest. However, some might see it as shallow or manipulative. The key here is whether there's deception. Since he's upfront about his wealth and uses it as a tool without lying, maybe he's not wrong. But the moral judgment from others might still apply. The friend's reaction is subjective, but the author isn't doing anything illegal or forcing anyone. Therefore, the answer might lean towards not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a line crossed. Since he's not using money to buy dates directly (he's showing off, not offering money for relationships), it's more about attraction through self-presentation. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
