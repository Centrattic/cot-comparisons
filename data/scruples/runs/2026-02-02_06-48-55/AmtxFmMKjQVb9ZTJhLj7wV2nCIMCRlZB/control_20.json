I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a 22-year-old guy with a trust fund and not considered good-looking. He's trying to attract girls by showcasing his wealth on social media\u2014posting about his condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he gets DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car to catch attention, and talks about his dad's business. He mentions that he's only doing this to get with girls, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Let's break it down.\n\nHe's using his wealth to attract attention from women. Is that inherently wrong? Well, using money to attract people isn't illegal, but there's a moral aspect here. He's being deceptive by presenting a certain image (wealthy, successful) to get girls' attention, but when he's with his friends, he's more low-key. That could be seen as insincere or manipulative. The friend who found out was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests others might see it as inauthentic.\n\nHe's also helping his friends with tuition, which is a positive aspect. But the main issue is his approach with the girls. If he's not being genuine in those interactions, then it's like he's leading them on with a fabricated persona. That could be considered unethical because it's not about building a real connection but using materialism as a tool. \n\nHowever, some might argue that people can present their best selves on social media, and if he's honest about his intentions, then it's not wrong. But the problem arises if the girls are led to believe he's someone he's not, or if they form a relationship based on false pretenses. The key here is whether deception is involved. If he's upfront about his tactics, maybe it's different, but in the context, he's using these displays strategically to attract attention, which implies some level of manipulation. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's a \"trust fund kid\" but not good-looking adds another layer. He's compensating for his perceived lack of physical appeal with material wealth, which some might see as a way to level the playing field, but others might see it as exploiting his wealth unfairly. \n\nHis friends being unaware of his tactics until he told one suggests that he's hiding this part of his life, which might indicate that he's not being transparent. If the girls he interacts with aren't aware that he's using these tactics to attract them, that could be deceptive. If they know, then it's a different scenario, but the story doesn't clarify that.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no legal wrongdoing, the ethical issue lies in manipulation and inauthenticity. Using wealth to attract others through deceptive means can be seen as morally wrong because it's not about genuine connection but exploiting his status. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
