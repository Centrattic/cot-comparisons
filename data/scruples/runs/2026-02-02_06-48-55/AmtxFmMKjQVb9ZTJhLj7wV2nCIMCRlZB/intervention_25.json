I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls, so he started using social media to showcase his wealth\u2014posting his condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He dresses better, drives his nicer car, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to attract attention. He only does this to get with girls, and he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and being normal. One friend found out and called him a huge asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's intentions and the methods he's using. He's using his wealth strategically to attract women, which could be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. The fact that he's presenting a different side of himself only to get dates raises questions about honesty and respect in relationships.\n\nIn dating, authenticity is often considered important. If someone is only interested in a relationship because of the other person's wealth, that can be seen as exploiting or objectifying the other person. Also, the author is leading a double life\u2014he's one person with friends and a completely different persona when trying to attract girls. This duality might indicate a lack of genuine connection, which could be problematic.\n\nHowever, there's no explicit mention of the author lying to the women he's dating. If he's not deceptive about his intentions or his wealth, some might argue that he's just being honest about his strategy. But the way he's using social media to create an image that attracts women solely based on his wealth might be seen as misleading. If the women are interested in him because of his posts and the lifestyle he portrays, then the author is capitalizing on their attraction to material things, which could be unethical.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's reaction. The friend was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are socially frowned upon. While friends' opinions can vary, the fact that someone close to him was so critical might indicate that there's a valid concern.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't necessarily lying to the women. If they are attracted to his wealth and he's not pretending to be someone else in the relationship, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the issue is more about using wealth as a tool to manipulate or attract others, which can be seen as inauthentic or exploitative.\n\nOn the other hand, people often present their best selves on social media. It's common to showcase positive aspects of life, even if it's a highlight reel. If the author is being honest about his intentions with the women he's dating, maybe it's not wrong. But the problem arises if he's misrepresenting himself to the women, leading them to believe in a connection that's based on materialism rather than genuine compatibility.\n\nThe author also mentions that he's a different person with his friends, which could imply that he's aware his behavior is inauthentic. This self-awareness might make the situation worse, as he's choosing to act a certain way for ulterior motives despite knowing it's not his true self.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be viewed as in the wrong because he's using his wealth to attract women in a way that's insincere and possibly exploitative. While it's not illegal, it's ethically questionable and may lead to superficial or unfulfilling relationships. The friend's negative reaction supports the idea that this behavior is seen as inappropriate or selfish.\n"
