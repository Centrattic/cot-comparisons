I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is a guy from a wealthy family who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls. He started using his wealth to attract attention on Instagram by posting his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He mentions that he uses this strategy to get girls, dressing better, showing off his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business. He says he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and being more normal. He told one friend his secret, and she called him a douche and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth to attract romantic attention. Is it wrong to use your money to impress people? Well, if someone is being honest about their intentions, maybe it's their choice. But if they're being deceptive or manipulative, that's different. The author is upfront in the way he's presenting his life on social media, even if he's curating a certain image. However, he admits he only does this to get girls, which could be seen as using his wealth as a tool for manipulation.\n\nNow, the friend called him an asshole, which suggests that others might see this as inauthentic or using money to compensate for lack of other qualities. The author also says he's a different person with his friends, which might imply that he's hiding his true self in other situations. This could be seen as two-faced or inauthentic.\n\nBut then again, everyone presents different versions of themselves in different contexts. It's not illegal or unethical to use your resources to attract others, as long as there's no deception involved. The author isn't lying about his wealth, just highlighting it in a way that's attractive. However, if he's being insincere in his interactions\u2014like pretending to be more interested in his dad's business than he actually is\u2014then that could be manipulative.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. If he's using girls by being fake, that's bad. But if he's being honest in his approach, even if it's self-serving, maybe it's not wrong. The key here is whether he's being deceptive. The author mentions he's a different person when with friends, suggesting he's not genuine in all areas of his life, which might make his actions seem like a facade.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. If someone close to him sees this as inconsiderate or shallow, that's a red flag. But others might argue that it's his personal life and he's not hurting anyone. The problem is if the girls he's interested in find out he's using them, which could lead to issues in relationships. But as long as he's honest, maybe it's not wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a mix of factors. Using wealth to attract attention isn't inherently wrong, but if it's done insincerely or with the intent to manipulate, it could be seen as unethical. The author's own admission of being a different person and the friend's negative reaction suggest that his approach is inauthentic, which could make him at fault. However, without clear deception, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the friend's reaction and the insincerity, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
