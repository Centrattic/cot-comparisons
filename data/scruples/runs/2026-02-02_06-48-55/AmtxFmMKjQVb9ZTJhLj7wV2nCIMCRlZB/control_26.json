I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The guy is 22, from a wealthy family, and he's using social media to showcase his wealth to attract girls. He mentions that he's not good-looking, so he's relying on his financial status to get attention. He's changed his behavior\u2014posting luxury items, dressing better, driving nicer cars, and talking about his dad's business.\n\nNow, the key points here are about using money to attract attention. The question is whether he's in the wrong. First, I need to consider the ethics of using wealth as a tool for social interaction. Is it inherently wrong to leverage your resources for personal gain in relationships? Some might argue it's manipulative, especially if the intention is solely to impress others without genuine connection. \n\nHe also mentioned that outside of this, he's a normal guy helping friends with tuition and being more down-to-earth with them. So there's a duality in his behavior. When he's with friends, he's not flaunting his wealth, which suggests he's aware of the difference. However, when he's trying to attract girls, he changes his behavior. \n\nThe friend who found out was shocked and called him an asshole. That reaction might be because he was deceptive about his intentions. If he's presenting a version of himself that's primarily about wealth to attract partners, it could be seen as insincere. Relationships built on such a foundation might lack authenticity, which could be problematic.\n\nBut then again, isn't everyone trying to present their best self in dating? People often highlight their strengths, whether it's hobbies, achievements, or looks. The line might be when it's a complete fabrication or when it's used to manipulate. Here, he's not lying about his wealth; he's just choosing to emphasize it. However, if the main goal is to attract girls and he's not being genuine about his personality beyond the wealth, that's where the issue might lie.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. If he's using money to gain attention but isn't being honest about his true self, that could be considered inauthentic. Also, the fact that he told a friend, leading to criticism, shows that there's a social stigma around this behavior. The friend's reaction might indicate that society views this as inconsiderate or shallow.\n\nOn the flip side, if he's not using his wealth to harm others or lie outright, maybe it's just a personal choice. But the problem might be the manipulation aspect\u2014using his status to get what he wants in a way that could lead to shallow relationships. The question is whether this is unethical or just a personal strategy.\n\nIn summary, while it's not illegal, the ethical issue here is about authenticity and intent. If he's solely using wealth to attract partners without genuine connection, it's manipulative. Therefore, many might consider him at fault for being inauthentic.\n"
