I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old trust fund kid, who's using social media to showcase his wealth, dressing up, and talking about his family's business to attract women. He's helping his friends financially but acts different when with them. His friend called him an asshole after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Using wealth to attract partners isn't inherently wrong, but it depends on the approach. If he's being deceptive or manipulating others by hiding his true intentions, that's problematic. The author admits he's being a \"douche\" in his methods, which suggests he's aware he's not being genuine when pursuing girls. Honesty in relationships is usually valued, so if he's pretending to be someone he's not just to get a girlfriend, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that he only tells his friends the truth when they ask might mean he's not being transparent with the women he's interested in. They might not know his main goal is to use his wealth to attract them. That could lead to insincere relationships where the women are being used for his ego or for their attention, which is exploitative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is helping his friends financially and acts normally around them. That shows he's not a bad person overall. But the core issue is whether using wealth to attract partners is wrong. While it's a common strategy, the problem here is the lack of authenticity and the transactional nature of the interactions. The friend's reaction (\"biggest asshole\") suggests that society might view this as inconsiderate or shallow.\n\nSo, considering the manipulation through deception and the transactional approach, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
