I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a wealthy 22-year-old who's using their wealth to attract girls by showing off their money on social media. They mention dressing better, driving nicer cars, visiting trendy places, and talking about their dad's business. They admit they're not good-looking and this is their strategy. They also help friends pay tuition and act normally around them, switching to a different persona when trying to get dates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main question is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. There's no legal issue, so it's about social norms and moral judgment. The author is being honest with themselves about their intentions, which is important. They're not hiding their motives from the girls they're interacting with, but maybe they're not being upfront during the interactions. However, the article doesn't mention that the girls are deceived about his motivations. He's open about his wealth in the sense that he's showcasing it, but maybe not about why he's using it. \n\nThe friend's reaction was shock and calling him an asshole. That's a strong reaction. The author admits he's being a \"huge douche\" but justifies it because he's not good-looking. The key points here are consent and deception. Are the girls aware that he's using his wealth to attract them? If they're responding to his posts and initiating contact, maybe they're into the lifestyle. But if he's only interested in them for their looks and using his wealth as a tool, that could be seen as objectifying them. However, there's nothing illegal here, and people have different values. Some might see it as manipulative, others as a personal choice in dating. \n\nAlso, the author is being transparent with his friends, which is a positive. He's helping friends financially, showing he's not just focused on wealth. The problem is whether the means of attracting partners are unethical. Since there's no coercion or lies to the girls, just a strategy, maybe it's not wrong. But some might argue it's exploitative. The friend's judgment is based on their own values, but it's not a universal truth. The answer depends on societal standards. In many contexts, people use various strategies to attract partners, and wealth is one of them. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong unless there's deception involved. Since the article doesn't mention deception, the answer might be B (No). But there's a nuance here. If he's being honest about his intentions when interacting with the girls, then it's fine. If he's leading them on without being upfront, that's different. The article doesn't specify, but since he's using social media to showcase wealth and the girls DM him, maybe they're aware of his lifestyle and choose to engage. Therefore, it's not inherently wrong. So, B is the answer.\n"
