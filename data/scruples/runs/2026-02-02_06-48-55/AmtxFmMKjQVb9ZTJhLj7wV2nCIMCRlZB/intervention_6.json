I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old who uses his wealth to attract girls by showcasing his money on social media, dressing well, using his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business. He also mentions helping friends pay tuition and being a different person with them. His friend called him an asshole after he confessed.\n\nI need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points here are his intentions and the impact of his actions. The author admits he's doing this to \"get with girls,\" which suggests he's using his wealth as a tool for attraction. The question is whether that's morally wrong. \n\nOn one hand, people can choose how they present themselves. Using social media to showcase possessions is common, and attraction can be subjective. He's not explicitly lying about his wealth, just emphasizing it to appeal to certain people. Also, he helps his friends, which might indicate he's not a bad person overall.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue he's being inauthentic or manipulative. If he's curating his image specifically to attract a certain type of girl, it could be seen as using his money to gain an unfair advantage. The friend's reaction suggests that some people view this as insincere or arrogant. However, others might say that as long as he's honest with his dates about who he is, it's his own life to live.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the action is wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format usually looks at if the person is intentionally harming others or being deceitful. In this case, the person isn't directly harming others; he's engaging in behavior that might be seen as shallow, but it's not illegal or obviously unethical. The friend's disapproval is a social judgment, not a moral violation. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's not doing anything unethical, though some might find it crass. Alternatively, if the focus is on his intent to manipulate, he might be seen as in the wrong. But the line between self-promotion and manipulation is blurry. Since the user already thinks he's in the wrong (option A), but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
