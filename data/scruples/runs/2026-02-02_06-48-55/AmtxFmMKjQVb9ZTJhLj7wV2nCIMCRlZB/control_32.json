I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old from a wealthy family, who uses social media to showcase their luxury items and lifestyle to get attention from women. They also mention switching between different personas depending on their social circle\u2014acting more down-to-earth with friends while using their wealth as a tool in social settings aimed at attracting romantic partners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Using wealth to attract others isn't inherently wrong, but the intention and honesty matter. The author is upfront about their intentions when interacting with the girls, but they also mention being deceptive by maintaining different personas. This duality could be seen as inauthentic. \n\nThen there's the friend's reaction. The friend was shocked and called the author an asshole, which suggests that the friend felt tricked or that the author's behavior was manipulative. The key here is whether the manipulation is unethical. If the author is not being genuine in their interactions with the girls, it could be seen as using them for their own benefit without their full knowledge, which is a form of deception.\n\nAnother angle is the societal view on using wealth in relationships. Some might argue that it's a personal choice and not someone else's problem, while others might see it as exploiting resources to gain social advantages. The author isn't stealing or harming anyone directly, but the manipulative aspect could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior might affect their self-perception and relationships. If they're relying on wealth to attract partners, it might lead to issues in forming genuine connections. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their approach is healthy.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a strong indicator. The friend felt the author was being a \"douche\" because of the deceptive tactics. This suggests that the author's actions are considered unethical by at least one person close to them. But the friend's judgment might be influenced by their own values or a sense of betrayal if they felt the author was being two-faced.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical judgment hinges on honesty and authenticity in relationships. If the author is using a facade to attract others without their full understanding, it's a form of manipulation, which could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
