I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The scenario is that the guy is from a wealthy family, uses his wealth to post on social media, drive nice cars, and talk about his dad's business to get noticed by girls. His friends aren't wealthy, and he helps them with tuition, but when they find out about his tactics, one calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is using his wealth as a tool to attract romantic attention, which some might see as manipulative or insincere. The friend's reaction indicates that she finds his approach dishonest and possibly exploitative. The key question is whether using wealth in this way is inherently wrong.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to use their resources as they see fit. However, if the intention is solely to attract others without genuine interest in forming real connections, it could be seen as shallow or disingenuous. The author mentions he's different around his non-wealthy friends, which might suggest he's aware of his behavior but still chooses to act differently around potential romantic partners.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the girls who are interested in him because of his wealth. Are they being misled? The author isn't hiding his wealth, but he's amplifying it to attract attention. This could lead to relationships based on materialism rather than mutual respect and genuine connection, which might be considered problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point to consider. She labeled him an asshole, indicating that even someone who knows his kind side still finds the method unacceptable. This suggests that the behavior crosses a line for some people, potentially harming his relationships with friends and others.\n\nHowever, others might argue that it's not wrong if he's honest about his intentions and the girls are equally aware they're being courted through material displays. But the problem is that the author is using a different persona when pursuing relationships, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical issue lies in the manipulation of social interactions for personal gain. Using wealth to attract partners can be seen as inauthentic and exploitative, which aligns with the friend's negative reaction. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
