I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. He changes his behavior when trying to meet women\u2014posting luxury items, driving nice cars, talking about his dad's business. But with friends, he's more down-to-earth.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. So, first, I need to consider the ethics of using money to attract partners. Is that inherently wrong? Some might say it's manipulative or inauthentic. Others might argue that it's just using one's resources to their advantage, which isn't illegal. However, there's the aspect of honesty. When he told his friend, she was shocked and called him an asshole. That suggests his friend felt deceived. The guy is presenting a different version of himself to women than he does to friends. \n\nBut is that deceptive? If someone is using social media to curate an image to attract others, is that different from other forms of self-presentation? People often present their best selves online. However, if the intent is solely to attract women through material displays rather than genuine connection, that could be seen as shallow or transactional. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping friends pay tuition shows he's not all about money. But the way he's approaching relationships with women might be problematic. The line between using wealth to impress and being genuine is thin. If the women he's attracting are interested in him for his money, that's one thing, but if he's being upfront about his wealth, maybe they know what they're getting into. However, if he's not honest about his motivations or if he's leading them on, that's another issue.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important. She considered him a different person when with friends versus when pursuing women. Deception in relationships can be a problem. If the women he's dating are unaware that his behavior is a strategy to attract them, then that's insincere. But if they're aware and still choose to engage, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nAnother angle: is using wealth to attract partners inherently wrong? Some people might find it icky, others might not. It's subjective. The key is whether there's deceit or exploitation. If he's not lying about who he is, just highlighting certain aspects, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not, that's a problem. \n\nHe mentions he's \"a different person when with friends,\" so he's compartmentalizing his identity. That could be seen as inauthentic. But is that necessarily wrong? People often have different sides in different social contexts. However, when it comes to dating, being genuine is usually valued. If he's not being genuine to the women he's dating, that could be an issue. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be seen as inauthentic and using materialism to compensate for other insecurities, which some might judge. On the other hand, he's not breaking any laws, and people use various strategies to attract partners. The key factor is the intent and whether there's deception involved. If the women are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him, it's their choice. However, if he's being deceptive about his motivations or his true self, that's where the problem lies. His friend's reaction suggests that she found it inauthentic and off-putting. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he's being inauthentic and using superficial means to attract women, which can be seen as manipulative.\n"
