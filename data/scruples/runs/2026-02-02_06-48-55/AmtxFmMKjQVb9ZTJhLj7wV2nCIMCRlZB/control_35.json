I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a wealthy man who uses his money to attract girls by showcasing his assets on social media and acting a certain way. He also helps some friends financially but switches his behavior around them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his actions are wrong. The key points are using money to attract women, being inauthentic, and potentially manipulating others. The question is about right or wrong, not just opinion. \n\nThe person is up front that he's doing this to get girls, which might be seen as using his wealth as a tool for dating. Some might argue that it's his choice how he uses his money, but others could see it as inauthentic or objectifying. The fact that he changes his behavior around friends vs. others might indicate a lack of genuine interaction. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that she found the tactic unethical. However, the person isn't harming anyone directly; he's just being strategic. But if he's being deceptive about his intentions, that's a problem. The line between confidence and arrogance might be thin here. \n\nAlso, the question is about being in the wrong. Ethically, using wealth to attract partners isn't illegal, but it can be seen as morally questionable. The issue is whether it's manipulative. If he's not lying outright but is being strategic with his presentation, it's a gray area. \n\nThe person's friends aren't wealthy, and he helps them, which shows he's not just using them. His behavior might be inauthentic but not necessarily malicious. However, the way he approaches relationships with the sole purpose of getting girls might be seen as disrespectful. \n\nUltimately, opinions can vary. If the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) because he's using a strategy that some view as manipulative. But others might say it's his choice. But the friend's reaction and the general consensus in AITA threads often lean towards authenticity. So maybe AITA is A.\n"
