I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls. So first, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. He started showcasing his wealth on Instagram, which increased his followers and led to DMs from girls. He uses his nicer car, goes to trendy places, talks about his dad's business to impress girls. He's also helping his friends with tuition and acts normally with them.\n\nThe key points here are the manipulation of others for social validation and the honesty in relationships. The author is using wealth as a tool to attract women, which can be seen as inauthentic. Some might argue that it's his choice to use his resources, but others might see it as objectifying others or using them for his own gain. The fact that he told a close friend, who then called him an asshole, shows that his actions are causing tension in his friendships.\n\nAlso, the question of consent is there. Are the girls he's interacting with aware that he's using his wealth to impress them? If they're just responding to his posts and he's using that to his advantage, it's a form of manipulation. However, if they're choosing to engage with him because they like what he's showing, maybe that's their choice. But when he's being deceptive about his intentions, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on his self-esteem. He's not confident in his looks, so he's relying on his wealth. That's a personal issue, but when it affects how he interacts with others, it's a social issue. The fact that he's different when with friends versus when trying to attract girls suggests he's not being genuine in those interactions, which could lead to shallow relationships.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. She's shocked and calls him an asshole because she didn't expect him to be so self-centered. This implies that his actions are seen as dishonest and that he's prioritizing his desire for attention over maintaining genuine connections.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Using wealth to attract others can be seen as manipulative and inauthentic. While it's his choice to use his resources, the dishonesty and the way it affects his relationships make it ethically questionable. The author is in the wrong because he's being deceptive and using others for his own gain, which undermines genuine connections.\n"
