I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 22-year-old guy using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's honest with his friends about this strategy, but one friend calls him an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. People have different values, and while some might see it as superficial or manipulative, others might view it as a personal strategy. The key points here are his intent and the impact on others.\n\nHe's being upfront about his motivations\u2014using money to get attention. There's no mention of deception in the dating itself; he's not lying about his intentions but is using his resources to attract women. The issue might be the method rather than the intent. However, if he's not being truthful with the women he's interested in, that's a problem. The question is whether it's the author's fault for using this tactic.\n\nHis friends, though, are affected by his actions. The friend who called him an asshole was shocked, implying that this behavior is seen as inauthentic or unethical. The author is splitting his behavior between his wealthy, attention-seeking persona and a more genuine side with friends. This duality might be seen as insincere, especially if he's not being consistent in his interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he's helping friends financially complicates the situation. It shows he's not solely self-serving, but the method of using wealth to attract partners could still be problematic. People might argue that using material possessions for dating is objectifying others, but the author doesn't claim to be objectifying the women; he's just using his resources to increase his social appeal.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether it's wrong to use one's resources to enhance personal relationships. While it's not illegal, social norms vary. Some might see it as a valid strategy, others as exploitative. The friend's reaction suggests that in her view, it's wrong because it's superficial. However, the author isn't actively harming the women he's dating, just being transparent about his approach with his friends.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily doing anything illegal or physically harmful, the use of wealth to attract partners might be considered unethical by some due to the emphasis on materialism over genuine connection. However, others might see it as a personal choice. The key here is that the author is using his resources to achieve his goals without deception, but the perception of being inauthentic could make him in the wrong, depending on societal standards.\n"
