I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 22-year-old man from a wealthy background who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media and in person. He's also helping a friend with tuition but behaves differently around them by using his non-luxury items.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being honest with himself about his motives, which are to attract women through material displays. He's not being deceptive in that sense. However, the question is whether it's wrong to use wealth in this way. Some might argue that it's manipulative or objectifying women into being interested for the wrong reasons. Others might say that if it's honest and there's no harm done, then it's not wrong.\n\nThe friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, but that's a personal opinion. The key here is intent. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's just highlighting it. But is using wealth to attract partners inherently wrong? It's a social strategy, but it could be seen as shallow or using others for one's own benefit. However, unless he's being deceptive or causing harm, it's a matter of personal choice. The fact that he helps friends financially and behaves differently around them shows he's not entirely defined by his wealth, which might mitigate the judgment. But the core issue is whether using money to attract women is wrong, which is subjective. However, the AITA community often values authenticity and respect, so using wealth to attract might be seen as inconsiderate or manipulative. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance.\n"
