I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and has trouble getting dates. To address this, he started showcasing his wealth on social media\u2014posting pictures of his condo, cars, watches, and trips. His followers increased, and he started getting DMs from \"hot girls.\" He also changes his behavior when meeting people, talking about his dad's business and his future role in it. However, he behaves differently with his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition and driving a regular car. He revealed his strategy to a friend, who criticized him for being a douche. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's using his wealth to attract attention, which could be seen as inauthentic. Manipulating social media presence to appear more attractive might be considered deceptive. Also, using different personas for different situations could indicate a lack of authenticity in relationships. If he's only interested in dating for superficial reasons or is being insincere, that's ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not directly harming others. He's honest with his friends about his methods, even if it's cringey. The girls who DM him might be aware of his social media presence and choose to engage with him. However, if he's leading them on with false pretenses, that's problematic. Also, the line between using one's resources (which he's entitled to) and being inauthentic is blurry.\n\nEthically, deception is a key factor. If he's being transparent with those he interacts with, then maybe it's his choice. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not to get dates, that's a form of manipulation. The friend's reaction suggests that the approach is seen as inauthentic and possibly arrogant. The author's behavior might also perpetuate materialistic values in relationships, which some might view as negative.\n\nConsidering these points, the author is being inauthentic and using manipulation tactics to attract dates. While it's his choice to manage his social media and how he presents himself, the intent to use wealth as a tool to attract others, rather than building genuine connections, leans towards being in the wrong. The friend's criticism supports this view. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
