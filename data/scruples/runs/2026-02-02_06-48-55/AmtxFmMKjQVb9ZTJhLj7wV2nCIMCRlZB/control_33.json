I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to get girls. The scenario is that he's a trust fund kid, not good-looking, and he started showcasing his wealth on Instagram to attract girls. He mentions that he's different when with his friends, helping them pay tuition, and being normal. But when he told a friend, she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. The author is using his wealth strategically to attract attention, which might be seen as manipulative. Using social media to post luxury items to get DMs from girls could be considered inauthentic. The key points are: is it wrong to use money to attract others? Does it violate social norms or ethical standards?\n\nThe friend's reaction is a data point. She called him an asshole, which suggests she finds it unethical. However, others might argue that it's his choice and not hurting anyone. But the issue is the intent: he's only doing this to get with girls, which is being deceptive or inauthentic. The author is presenting a curated version of himself, which could be seen as misleading. Relationships built on such foundations might be based on false pretenses. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say it's his way of navigating the dating scene, and people can choose to engage or not. However, the line between using money to attract and being deceptive is thin. The fact that he's hiding this tactic from others except his friend, who was surprised and upset, shows that he knows there's something questionable about it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's different with friends, which might indicate he's aware of his behavior's inauthenticity. The ethical concern is about honesty and authenticity in social interactions. If he's being a different person when trying to attract girls, then that's insincere. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the manipulative use of wealth and inauthentic behavior.\n"
