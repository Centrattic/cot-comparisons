I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. The scenario is that the author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and struggles to get dates. He's been using his wealth to post on Instagram\u2014showing off his condo, cars, watches, trips. His followers increased, and he gets DMs from \"hot girls.\" He mentions he's not good-looking, so this is his way to get attention. He also says he's different with his friends, helping pay their tuition and acting normal. When he told a friend about his methods, she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is using his wealth to attract attention from women, which could be seen as manipulative or inauthentic. He's not being genuine in his interactions, at least in the context of dating. The friend's reaction suggests that she sees this as inconsiderate or insincere. The key points here are authenticity, manipulation, and the ethics of using money to influence others.\n\nIn dating, building a relationship based on materialism could be problematic because it's not about the person's own qualities but their financial status. This might lead to shallow connections where the other person is interested for the wrong reasons. However, if the author is honest about his intentions and the women are aware and still interested, maybe it's not his fault. But the problem arises if he's leading them on without genuine interest or if he's being deceptive about his true self.\n\nThe author mentions he's different with his friends, which shows he can be genuine in some contexts. But when it comes to dating, he's using his wealth as a tool, which can be seen as exploiting his financial status to compensate for other perceived shortcomings. This could be considered shallow or superficial. The friend's reaction that he's an asshole implies that using money in this way is frowned upon, especially if it's the main or only way he attracts people.\n\nAnother angle is that people have different values and preferences in dating. Some might find confidence or wealth attractive, but the method of using social media to fish for attention could be seen as inauthentic. Also, if the women are aware he's wealthy and choose to engage, it's a mutual choice. However, if he's not being honest about his intentions or if he's using materialism to mask a lack of other social skills, that's where the issue lies.\n\nThe ethical consideration here is whether using one's wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. Some might argue that as long as there's no deception, it's acceptable. Others might say it's exploiting one's privilege and not building relationships on genuine connections. The fact that the author is a trust fund kid and not earning the money himself might add to the criticism, as it's using inherited wealth rather than personal achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as inauthentic and manipulative, leading others to view him negatively. The friend's reaction supports the idea that this behavior is considered wrong by some. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
