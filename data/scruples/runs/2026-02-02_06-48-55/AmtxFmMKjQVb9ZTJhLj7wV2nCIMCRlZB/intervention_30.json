I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using his wealth to attract girls through social media and other displays. \n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old who uses his family's wealth to showcase his lifestyle on Instagram. He mentions that he does this specifically to get attention from women, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole. \n\nThe question is whether this makes him the asshole. From a moral standpoint, there's a line between using your resources to attract partners and being deceptive or manipulative. The author is being honest with himself about his motivations, but the issue here is whether he's being deceptive to the women. \n\nHe's not lying directly, but he might be presenting a curated image that's more about his wealth than who he is as a person. The fact that he's different around his friends suggests he's aware of the contrast. However, the women he's interacting with might be attracted to the lifestyle rather than his genuine self, which could lead to superficial relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, people often use their strengths to attract others, and wealth can be one of those strengths. The problem arises if he's being insincere or if he's exploiting his wealth to manipulate others. Since he's upfront with his friends about his tactics but not necessarily with the women he's dating, there's a potential for deception. \n\nThe friend's reaction indicates that society might view this behavior as inauthentic or shallow. However, personal opinions can vary. Legally, there's no wrongdoing here, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't harming anyone physically, but emotionally, if the women feel used after realizing the relationship was based on wealth, that's an issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are ethically questionable because he's using his wealth as a primary tool to attract women without being fully transparent. This manipulation, even if not outright lying, could be seen as inconsiderate of the women's feelings and intentions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong based on ethical considerations of honesty and authenticity in relationships.\n"
