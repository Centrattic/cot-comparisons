I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls on social media. The author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who posts about his luxurious lifestyle to get attention from women. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finding it hard to date otherwise. He's been doing this for a year, and even though he's helping his friends by paying their tuition and acts normally around them, he told one friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Is it wrong to use your wealth to attract people? The author isn't lying about his wealth, just choosing to highlight it. But maybe the issue is that he's being inauthentic. He's presenting a persona solely to attract women, which could be seen as insincere. However, people do often present their best selves on social media. \n\nThen there's the aspect of using social media as a tool. It's common for people to curate their online presence to attract attention, whether for dating or other reasons. But the key question is whether this is manipulative. The author isn't explicitly lying about his intentions; he's using his resources to his advantage, which some might see as exploiting his wealth for personal gain. Others might argue that it's just being strategic in a competitive dating market.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She was shocked and called him an asshole. That suggests to others that his behavior is viewed negatively. But maybe her reaction is more about the deception aspect\u2014using wealth as a tactic rather than being genuine. The author does admit he's a \"huge douche\" in this context, which indicates he's aware of the inauthenticity.\n\nAnother angle: Is it wrong to use what you have to improve your social standing? If someone is using their resources to meet people, is that inherently wrong? Some might say no, as it's a form of self-promotion. However, if the sole purpose is to attract women and not based on genuine connection, that could be problematic. The author's behavior might be seen as transactional, reducing the interactions to materialistic terms. \n\nAlso, the part where he helps his friends pay tuition and acts normally around them shows he's not entirely inauthentic. But the key issue is the dual standard\u2014using his wealth strategically for dating while maintaining a different persona with friends. This duality might be seen as hypocritical or inauthentic. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's common for people to use social media to attract attention, there's an expectation of honesty in relationships. If the women he interacts with are aware of his wealth and are drawn to that, maybe they're being inauthentic too. But the author's deception (if any) lies in not being upfront about his tactics. However, he's not lying about his wealth; he's just choosing to showcase it. \n\nThe debate here hinges on whether being strategic with one's assets for personal gain is unethical. Some might argue it's a form of manipulation, while others see it as self-marketing. The fact that he's using a different approach in different social contexts might be seen as being inauthentic, leading to the negative reaction from his friend. \n\nSo weighing all these factors, the author's actions are ethically ambiguous. However, the consensus often leans towards authenticity in relationships. Since he's using his wealth as a tool rather than building genuine connections, and it's led to a negative reaction from someone close, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
