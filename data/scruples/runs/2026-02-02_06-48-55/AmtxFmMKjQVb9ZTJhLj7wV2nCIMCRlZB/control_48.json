I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is wrong. The person is a 22-year-old man who's using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his money on social media. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls otherwise. He's changed his approach by posting his condo, cars, etc., to get attention. He also mentions that when he's with his friends, he acts different and helps them with tuition. However, he told one friend about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is using wealth as a tool to attract romantic partners. On one hand, people might argue that using money to impress others isn't fair or genuine, as it's not about the person's character. It could be seen as manipulative or shallow. On the other hand, some might say that everyone uses their strengths to attract others, and it's not inherently wrong. The person isn't using money in a deceptive way beyond what's visible on social media, which is a common practice these days.\n\nHe's also helping his friends, which shows he has a supportive side. However, the key point is his intent: he's using these tactics solely to get with girls. The friend who found out was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that this behavior isn't socially acceptable in her eyes. There's also the aspect of authenticity\u2014presenting a certain image to attract people might not be genuine, which could lead to issues if discovered later.\n\nAnother angle is that he's not misleading about his wealth; he's just showing it off. But the problem is the manipulation aspect. If he's using his wealth strategically to gain attention, it's a form of using material status to achieve personal goals, which some might find unethical. However, others might argue that people often curate their social media to present the best version of themselves, so this isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe fact that he's a trust fund kid adds to the debate. If he's not earning the money himself, does that make it more problematic? Maybe not, since the money is still his to use. But some might see it as exploiting inherited wealth for personal gain in relationships. \n\nIn terms of consent and honesty, if the women he's interested in are aware of his wealth and are attracted to that, maybe it's a mutual choice. However, if he's not transparent about his motives, that could be an issue. The story doesn't say whether he's been honest with the women he's dating. If he's leading them on under the guise of being genuine, that's problematic. But if they're into the lifestyle and he's upfront, it's a different story.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. She found out the method and was shocked, calling him an asshole. That reaction might be based on her values, where using wealth to attract partners is seen as inauthentic or manipulative. This suggests that there's a societal judgment against such behavior, which could mean he's in the wrong if we consider others' perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, there are arguments both ways. The key factors are intent, authenticity, and the impact on others. While some might see it as a legitimate strategy, others would consider it unethical. Given that the friend's negative reaction indicates that this behavior is frowned upon in some circles, the answer might lean towards AITA (the person is in the wrong).\n"
