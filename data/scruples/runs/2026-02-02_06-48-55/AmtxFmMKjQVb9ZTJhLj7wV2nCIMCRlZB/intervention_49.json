I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the AITA story provided. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his money and status to attract women on social media. He posts about his luxury items, which increases his followers and leads to DMs from women. He admits he does this primarily to get girls, but claims he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and acting more normally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being honest with his intentions, but is that manipulation? Using wealth to attract partners can be seen as exploitative if the women aren't aware of his motivations. However, the story doesn't mention explicit deception. He's upfront about his tactics, but when he told a friend, she was shocked. That suggests that while he's not lying, he's using a strategy that others might find manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual interest. If the women are interested in his lifestyle and he's not hiding it, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. But relationships built on materialism can be problematic. Also, the fact that he's helping friends financially while using his wealth to attract women might show a double standard. People might argue that it's okay to use your assets if it's within honest bounds, but others see it as inauthentic and using money as a substitute for personal qualities.\n\nThe friend's reaction indicates that his behavior is socially frowned upon. Even if he's not technically deceptive, the act of curating a persona to attract women could be seen as insincere. The question of whether it's wrong depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. Some might say it's a legitimate strategy in a world where appearance and status matter, while others might see it as exploiting others' materialistic tendencies.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be viewed as inauthentic and manipulative, even if not outright deceptive. The key point is whether the women are aware of his true motives and whether they engage willingly. The story doesn't clarify the women's perspectives, but the author's own admission that he's doing this solely to get girls into relationships might imply that the relationships aren't based on genuine connection. That leans towards him being in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
