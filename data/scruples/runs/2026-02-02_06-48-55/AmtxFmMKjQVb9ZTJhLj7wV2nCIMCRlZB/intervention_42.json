I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family. He's not good-looking and has trouble getting dates, so he started using his wealth to attract girls by posting luxury stuff on Instagram. He mentions that he dresses better, drives his nicer car, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He says he only does this to get with girls, but when he told a friend about it, she called him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider if using wealth to attract romantic partners through social media is unethical or just a personal choice. \n\nFirst, using wealth to attract attention isn't inherently wrong. People use their strengths in various ways, and if someone isn't good-looking, they might focus on other aspects like money. But there's a line when it's about manipulation or deception. The author is being upfront about his intentions in his posts\u2014showing his wealth to attract girls. However, when he told his friend, she was shocked, implying he didn't disclose this to the girls directly. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about authenticity. If he's pretending to be someone else just to get dates, that could be seen as insincere. However, the girls who DM him are responding to the content he posts, so they might be aware of his wealth and choose to engage. It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's not lying if he's just showcasing his life as it is. On the other hand, if he's exaggerating or creating a persona solely to attract others, that's different. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that the method is considered crass or inauthentic by others. But societal views on this vary. Some might see it as a fair game in dating, while others think it's shallow. The fact that he helps friends pay for tuition and acts differently around them shows he's not a bad person, but the method he uses is questionable. \n\nThe main ethical concern is whether he's being deceptive or using manipulation. If he's honest with the girls about his intentions and they're okay with it, then maybe it's not wrong. But if he's leading them on under false pretenses, that's a problem. However, the story doesn't mention deceit; he's just using his wealth as a tool. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a matter of perspective. The author might be seen as in the wrong for being inauthentic and using materialism to attract others, which some might view as unethical. Others might say it's a personal choice and not inherently wrong. But given the friend's reaction and the common perception that using money to attract partners is shallow, the answer might be A (in the wrong).\n"
