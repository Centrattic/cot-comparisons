I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions dressing better, using his nicer car, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. He also helps his less wealthy friends financially and acts more down-to-earth with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being accused of being inauthentic, using his wealth to manipulate or attract women. The key points are about honesty in relationships and whether using wealth in this way is deceptive or disrespectful. The friend's reaction was shock and calling him an asshole, which suggests others might see this as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that people use their assets to attract others, and it's not inherently wrong unless there's deception. The author is upfront with his friends about his tactics, though not with the girls he's trying to attract. Also, he helps his friends financially, showing he's not just money-focused. However, the main issue is the use of wealth to manipulate social interactions, which can be seen as inauthentic and potentially exploitative.\n\nI need to decide if using wealth to attract partners is inherently unethical. If he's not lying about his intentions but is being strategic, is that wrong? Or does it cross a line when it's about materialism and not genuine connection? The friend's reaction indicates that others might view this as inconsiderate or manipulative. Also, the author's own admission that he's a \"huge douche\" suggests self-awareness of the negative perception. \n\nConsidering these points, the author is likely in the wrong because he's using his wealth to manipulate social interactions and appears to be prioritizing materialism over genuine relationships. Even if he's not lying, the tactic is seen as inauthentic and potentially disrespectful to the women he's trying to attract. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
