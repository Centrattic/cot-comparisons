I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using money to attract girls. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who isn't good-looking and finds it hard to get dates. He started using social media to post about his wealth\u2014condo, cars, trips\u2014gaining followers and DMs from girls. He's dressing better, showing off his nicer car, going to trendy places, and talking about his dad's business. When with friends, he's more down-to-earth, helping pay their tuition and using his Honda. He told a friend his strategy, and she called him an asshole for using money to get girls. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the ethics. Using money to attract people can be seen as manipulative. It might be exploiting others' materialism or superficial values. But the author isn't explicitly lying about his intentions, just being selective in how he presents himself. On the other hand, he's being honest with his friends about his approach, though maybe not with the girls. \n\nThen, the impact. If the girls are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him because of it, it's a mutual decision. But if he's leading them on without intending to form genuine relationships, that's deceptive. The author mentions he's only doing this to get with girls, which implies he might not be interested in meaningful connections. That's a problem because it's using people for his own gain without their full knowledge.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that his method is seen as inauthentic and disrespectful. Even if he's not lying about being wealthy, presenting it in a way that's just to attract attention could be considered insincere. The fact that he's a different person when with friends shows that he's aware of the duality, which might make the situation worse.\n\nAnother angle: everyone has different ways to attract partners. If he's not harming anyone directly and the girls are willing participants, maybe it's not his fault. But the issue is whether it's ethical to use wealth as a primary tool for dating. Societal views might differ, but the friend's judgment indicates that his approach is frowned upon.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's not illegal, the author is using manipulation through social media to attract women based on his wealth, which many would consider inconsiderate or superficial. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
