I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 22-year-old man is using his wealth to attract women by showcasing his expensive items on Instagram and talking about his family's business. He mentions that he's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls otherwise. He's helping his friends pay tuition, but when he told one of them about his tactics, she called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if others agree. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Using money to attract partners can be seen as objectifying others, implying that women are only interested in wealth. That's a common criticism in such scenarios. The author is being upfront about his intentions\u2014only doing this to get with girls. However, the question is whether that makes him wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, it's his choice how he presents himself. People often use social media to highlight certain aspects of their lives. The issue might be the intent behind it, but there's no mention of deception. He's not lying about who he is, just emphasizing his wealth. However, the friend's reaction is negative, suggesting that using wealth as a primary tool for attraction is seen as inauthentic or manipulative. \n\nAlso, the author is helping his friends financially, which could indicate he's not solely self-serving. But the act of using money to attract women might still be problematic. There's a line between being honest about one's assets and using them as a tool for manipulation. \n\nI think the key points are: intent, deception, and the impact on others. Since he's not lying but is using wealth as a strategy, it's a matter of opinion whether that's wrong. However, many might argue that it's inauthentic and could lead to shallow relationships. The friend's strong reaction supports the idea that others see it as asshole behavior. So the answer is likely A.\n"
