I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the guy is 22, from a wealthy family, and he's using his money to attract girls. He posts his nice stuff online, gets DMs from them, dresses better, drives nice cars, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business. The key point is that he's doing all this specifically to get with girls. He's not being upfront about it; he's presenting himself as a well-off guy to attract attention. \n\nHe mentions that he's a different person with his friends, like taking a Honda instead of his nicer car and going to normal bars. That shows he's aware of different social contexts, but when it comes to dating, he's using his wealth as a tool. His friend was shocked and called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions are seen as manipulative or inauthentic.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is in the wrong. Using money to attract people can be seen as using materialism as a substitute for genuine connection. If someone is only interested in you because of your money, that's a problem, but the question is about the person doing the using. The author isn't necessarily lying about his wealth, but he's leveraging it in a way that might not be honest about his intentions or how he's presenting himself. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say everyone uses their assets to attract others, but if it's done in a way that's deceptive or inauthentic, it could be considered wrong. The fact that he's not being upfront about his motives when interacting with the girls might be the issue. His friend's reaction also indicates that others see this as problematic. So, I think the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's using his wealth in a manipulative and inauthentic way to get what he wants without transparency.\n"
