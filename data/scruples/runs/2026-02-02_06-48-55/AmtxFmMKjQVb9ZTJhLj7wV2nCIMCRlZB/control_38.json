I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He's using his wealth to attract attention from girls by showcasing his possessions on social media. He mentions that he's not good-looking, so he's relying on his money and status to get dates. He's been doing this for a year, dressing better, using his nicer car, and going to trendy places to talk to girls about his dad's business and his future in it. However, when he confided in one of his friends about this strategy, she called him an asshole or a douche.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. First, the ethical aspect: is it wrong to use money to attract partners? Some might argue that it's using wealth as a tool for manipulation, which can be seen as inauthentic or exploitative. Others might say that if both parties are aware and consent to the relationship, then it's not inherently wrong. However, the problem arises if the girls are only interested in his money, which could lead to a lack of genuine connection.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on his relationships with others. He mentions helping friends pay for tuition and being a different person with them. When he told his friend about his strategy, she was shocked and criticized him. This suggests that his actions might be viewed as deceptive or inconsiderate, especially if his friends feel he's being insincere or manipulative in his dating life. The friend's reaction indicates that his behavior is seen as unethical by some people close to him.\n\nThere's also the aspect of self-honesty. The author admits he's acting differently to attract girls, which might mean he's not presenting his true self. This could lead to superficial relationships where the girls are only interested in his wealth, which might not be fulfilling for him in the long run. Additionally, if the girls aren't aware that his interest in them is purely for their appearance and not for genuine connection, there's a potential for exploitation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's being honest about his intentions. He's using his resources to achieve his goals, which might be a legitimate strategy. If the girls are interested in him for his money and he's aware of that, then maybe it's a mutual exchange. However, the issue here is whether the girls are being truthful about their own intentions. If they're only interested in his wealth and he's exploiting that, then it's a problem. But if he's clear about his intentions from the start, it might be a different scenario.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's helping his friends financially shows a different side of him, which might mitigate some of the negative judgment. However, his actions in the dating scene are still under scrutiny. The key point is whether using wealth to attract partners is inherently wrong. In many cultures, using money to attract partners is frowned upon because it's seen as transactional and lacks authenticity. However, societal views vary, and some might see it as a valid strategy in a competitive dating market.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as inauthentic and exploitative, especially if he's not upfront about his intentions. The friend's negative reaction supports the idea that his behavior is considered unethical by others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
