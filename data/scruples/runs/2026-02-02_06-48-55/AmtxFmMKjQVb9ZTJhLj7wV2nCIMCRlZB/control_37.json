I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his money and status to attract women. He's showing off his possessions on social media, dressing better, driving nicer cars, going to trendy places, and talking about his dad's business. He's also being a different person in front of his non-wealthy friends, helping them with tuition. He told one of his friends about his strategy, and she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is using money to attract women. The man is being upfront about his tactics, but is it wrong? Well, using wealth to impress others can be seen as superficial or manipulative. However, it's also a common strategy in social dynamics. People often highlight their assets to attract others, whether it's money, looks, or other traits. \n\nThen there's the aspect of being a different person around others. He's helping his friends financially, which is good, but he's also being two-faced. When he's with his friends, he drives a Honda and goes to normal bars, but when he's trying to attract women, he's all about luxury. That could be seen as inauthentic. However, maybe he's just adapting to different social contexts, which is normal for some people.\n\nHis friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, but her judgment might be influenced by her own values. Is he hurting anyone besides not being genuine? If the women he's attracting are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him knowing that's his game, then maybe it's not his fault. But if he's being deceptive or leading them on, that's different. However, the scenario doesn't mention deception\u2014just that he's using his status as a tool. \n\nAnother angle is the trust fund aspect. He's not using illegal or unethical means; it's just his money. People often use their resources to their advantage. However, there's a moral question about valuing material possessions over other traits. But is that inherently wrong? It might be seen as shallow, but not necessarily unethical.\n\nHe's also helping his friends, which shows he's not entirely self-serving. But the fact that he's using his wealth to get dates might be seen as transactional or objectifying women, treating them as rewards for his money. However, if both parties are consenting and aware, it's a personal choice.\n\nThe friend's reaction might stem from her disapproval of his methods, but that doesn't automatically mean he's wrong. People have different opinions on such tactics. The key is whether his actions are harming others. If the women are okay with it and he's not lying, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's leading them to believe he's someone he's not, that's a problem. The scenario says he's talking about his dad's business and future plans, but not necessarily lying about his personality. \n\nSo, considering all this, the man is using his wealth to attract women, which some might see as manipulative or shallow, but since he's not actively lying and people can choose to engage with him, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the authenticity angle is there. But the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. Different people might have different views here. But the key points are: using wealth as a tool isn't illegal, but it's a matter of ethics and personal values. The answer might be B (no), because he's not doing anything illegal or clearly unethical, even if it's seen as superficial. His friend's judgment is subjective.\n"
