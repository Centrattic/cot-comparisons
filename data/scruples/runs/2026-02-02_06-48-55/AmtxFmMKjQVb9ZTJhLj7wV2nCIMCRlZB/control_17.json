I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family. He has a trust fund, so he's not struggling financially. He's not good-looking and finds it hard to get girls, so he started using his wealth to attract them. He posts his condo, cars, watches, trips on Instagram, which led to increased followers and DMs from \"hot girls.\" He's been doing this for a year, now dresses better, uses his nicer car more, and goes to trendy places. He talks about his dad's business and mentions he'll join next year. He knows he sounds like a douche but does it specifically to get with girls. The rest of the time, he's a normal guy helping friends with tuition and using his Honda for their hangouts. He told a friend his secret, and she called him an asshole/douche.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The core issue seems to be using money and social media to attract women. The author is aware that his behavior might be seen as inconsiderate (\"I know I sound like a huge douche\"), but he justifies it by saying he's doing it to get with girls and is otherwise a good person when with friends.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, using wealth to attract romantic partners could be seen as manipulative or insincere. People might argue that it's using materialism as a tool for deception, which is unethical because it doesn't reflect genuine self. The friend's reaction suggests that this approach is socially frowned upon. On the other hand, the author isn't stealing from others or being harmful beyond the potential inauthenticity. He's also helping friends financially, which is a positive trait.\n\nBut the main concern is the integrity of the relationships. If he's using his wealth as a primary means to attract women, it could mean he's not being genuine, which could lead to situations where women are only interested in him for his money. That's a problem because relationships based on materialism rather than mutual respect can be problematic and potentially harmful. The fact that he only does this for romantic purposes and reverts to a simpler lifestyle with friends shows a dual standard, which might indicate a lack of authenticity.\n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. It's a bit subjective. If the women he interacts with are aware of his wealth and choose to engage with him for that reason, maybe it's their choice too. But the author's approach is clearly manipulative, using social media as a tool to present a curated image that's designed to impress, not to be truthful. This could be considered unethical as it's a form of deception. The friend's reaction implies that the method is seen as arrogant or shallow. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is being honest with himself about his methods, but the problem arises if he's being deceptive with others. If the women he's interacting with don't know the full context (like that he's just using his wealth to attract them), then it's a form of manipulation. If they do know and still choose to engage, then it's their choice. But the way he's using it\u2014posting luxurious items and talking about his dad's business\u2014suggests he's emphasizing his wealth to appear more desirable, which is a form of using money to get attention. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and authenticity are usually valued. If the author is only showing his wealthy side to attract girls, and not being his \"normal\" self, that could lead to issues later when the truth comes out. The friend's shock and her labeling him as an asshole indicate that his method is not socially acceptable. Even if he doesn't intend to be a jerk, the act of using money to manipulate perceptions for romantic gain is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using a strategy that's inauthentic and potentially deceptive. While there's no direct harm like financial exploitation, the deceit in how he presents himself for romantic purposes is problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
