I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The scenario is that the author is a 22-year-old trust fund kid who's not good-looking and struggles to get dates. He started using social media to showcase his wealth\u2014posting about his condo, cars, trips, etc.\u2014and got a lot of DMs from girls. He dresses better, drives his nicer car to catch attention, and talks about his dad's business. He says he's only doing this to get girls, and when he told a friend, she called him an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the author is being honest about his intentions. He's using his wealth as a tool to attract women, which could be seen as manipulative or insincere. On the other hand, he's not doing anything illegal or harmful. He's just leveraging what he has to improve his dating prospects. The question is whether that's morally wrong.\n\nThe friend's reaction was shock and calling him an asshole. That might reflect societal disapproval of someone being perceived as using money to attract others. But is it the author's fault for being honest? Or is the friend being judgmental?\n\nI should also think about consent and autonomy. The girls who DM him are choosing to reach out, so maybe they're interested in his wealth. But if the author isn't being genuine, that could be an issue in a relationship. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for using this strategy, not whether the girls are being manipulated.\n\nAnother point is how the author presents himself. By showcasing wealth, he might be creating fake expectations or hiding his true self. But he's not lying about his financial status. It's just that he's using it as a tool for attraction, which could be seen as superficial or self-serving.\n\nBut then again, everyone uses their assets to attract others. Some people use looks, others use humor, intelligence, or wealth. It's a matter of being upfront about it. The author seems to be aware that he's perceived as a \"douche,\" but he's not hiding his intentions from those who DM him. The issue arises when he tells his friend, maybe because she values authenticity over materialism.\n\nSo, is it the author's fault for being honest about his methods, or is the friend right in calling him out for being inauthentic? If the author isn't being deceptive about his actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using manipulation tactics to get what he wants without considering the feelings of others, then he is.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being deceptive. Since he's not hiding his wealth, but uses it to attract women, it's a personal choice. However, the way he presents himself might be seen as inauthentic if he's only using wealth to impress others. Plus, the fact that he's helping his friends financially shows he's not entirely selfish. \n\nBut the act of using wealth to attract people could be seen as exploitative or shallow, which the friend finds offensive. The author's justification is that he's using his resources, which he has, to improve his dating life. However, the perception is that he's being a \"douche\" because he's prioritizing image over authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal norms and personal values. If authenticity and sincerity are valued more than materialism, then the author is in the wrong. But if it's about personal freedom to use one's resources as they see fit, then he's not. Considering the friend's reaction and the common societal judgment against such tactics, I lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
