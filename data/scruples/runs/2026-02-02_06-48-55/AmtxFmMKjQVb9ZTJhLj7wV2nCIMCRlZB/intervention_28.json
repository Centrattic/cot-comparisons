I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family, not good-looking, and he's using his wealth to attract girls. He posts about his condo, cars, watches, and trips on Instagram to get more followers and DMs from women. He dresses better, takes his nicer car out, goes to trendy places, and talks about his dad's business to impress them. He admits he's doing all this just to get with girls, but he's a different person with his friends, helping them pay tuition and being more normal with a Honda and student bars. His friend found out and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using money to attract people is inherently wrong. Some might argue that people express themselves through their wealth, and if he's being honest about it, maybe it's not wrong. Others might say it's manipulative or using others for his status. Also, the fact that he's presenting a curated version of himself could be seen as deceptive. He's not being authentic, which could be an issue. The friend's reaction shows that others might not approve, which adds to the social judgment aspect. However, there's a difference between showing off wealth and using it to attract partners. The key here is intent and whether it's misleading. If he's upfront with the girls about his intentions, then it's a matter of personal choice. But if he's pretending to be someone he's not and leading them on without genuine interest, that's more problematic. The author's own admission that he's acting differently and only doing this for romantic purposes suggests that his actions are insincere. In relationships, authenticity is often valued, so using wealth as a tool to attract partners might be seen as inauthentic and therefore in the wrong. Also, the fact that his friend feels he's being an asshole indicates that his behavior isn't socially accepted by those close to him. So, considering all these points, I think the author is in the wrong because he's being inauthentic and potentially manipulative, even if he's not breaking any laws. So the answer should be A.\n"
