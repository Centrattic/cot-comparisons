I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the AITA scenario provided. The author is a 22-year-old man from a wealthy family who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media. He's dressing better, showing off his nice car, and talking about his dad's business to impress girls. He also helps his friends pay tuition but acts normal around them. When he told a friend about his strategy, she was shocked and called him a douche.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is being honest with himself and, it seems, with the girls he's interacting with, but maybe not. He's using his wealth as a tool to attract attention, which could be seen as manipulative. Is that inherently wrong? Some might say it's just a strategy, others might argue it's exploiting his resources to gain romantic attention, which isn't genuine. \n\nThe friend's reaction is a key point. She was shocked, indicating that his approach is unexpected or frowned upon. The fact that he had to \"spill the beans\" suggests he might not have been upfront initially. If the girls knew he was wealthy, maybe they were attracted to him for his money, but if he's not being honest about his intentions or methods, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not good-looking and finds it hard to attract girls otherwise. This could be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't necessarily justify the approach. The question is whether using wealth to attract partners is ethically wrong. \n\nSome might say everyone uses their assets to attract others, whether it's looks, personality, or money. But there's a line when it's the primary method and the person is being inauthentic. The author's dual life\u2014helping friends and acting normal around them, but using wealth for dating\u2014shows a lack of consistency. If he's genuine with friends but inauthentic with romantic interests, that's a red flag. \n\nThe friend's judgment implies that society might view this as deceitful. Even if the author isn't hurting anyone directly, the method could be seen as using others for his benefit without mutual respect. The key issue is honesty and authenticity in relationships. If the girls are being attracted by his wealth and not his true self, that's a problem. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is manipulating his resources to gain romantic attention, which could be considered unethical. The fact that he hides this aspect of himself from friends and presents a different persona for dating suggests a lack of integrity. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
