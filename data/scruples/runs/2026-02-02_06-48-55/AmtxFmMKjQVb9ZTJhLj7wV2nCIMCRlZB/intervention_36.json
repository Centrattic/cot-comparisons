I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 22-year-old man who uses his wealth to attract women by showcasing his possessions on social media and in person. He's upfront about his intentions, and even admitted to a friend, who then criticized him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using his wealth as a tool to gain attention from women, which some might see as manipulative or insincere. However, others might argue that it's his strategy to navigate social situations, especially if he's not good-looking and finds it hard to connect otherwise. \n\nThe key points here are consent and deception. The author isn't lying about his wealth; he's being honest about it. However, the question is whether using wealth to attract women is inherently wrong. Some might say that if he's transparent about his motives and the women are aware of his intentions, then it's their choice to engage. But the problem arises when the author is presenting a curated image that's different from his usual self. He changes his behavior specifically to attract women, which could be seen as inauthentic. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. She called him an asshole, which indicates that his actions are socially frowned upon, even if they're not illegal. The ethical dilemma here is about respect and genuine connections. If the women are being drawn in by his wealth for superficial reasons, it might lead to relationships that aren't based on mutual compatibility. \n\nOn the other hand, people use various tactics to meet others, and wealth is just one of many tools. If the author is honest about who he is and what he's offering, then it's a matter of personal choice for the women involved. However, if he's misrepresenting himself beyond just his wealth (like pretending to be more interesting or kind), that's a different issue. \n\nThe author does mention that he's a different person when with his non-wealthy friends, which suggests a lack of authenticity in his interactions. This duality might indicate that he's not being his true self, which could be a problem in forming genuine relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as unethical because he's using his wealth as a primary tool to attract women, which might be considered shallow or manipulative. Even if it's not illegal, it's a matter of social judgment and respect. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
