I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their wealth to attract girls. The author is a 22-year-old from a wealthy family who uses social media to showcase their money, like posting about their condo, cars, and trips. They mention that they started getting a lot of DMs from \"hot girls\" after doing this. They also say they act differently when they're with their friends who aren't wealthy, driving a Honda and going to student bars. The main issue is that they told one of their friends their strategy, and she called them an asshole/douche.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if using one's wealth to attract others is inherently wrong. On one hand, people have different ways of trying to attract partners, and it's their choice how they present themselves. On the other hand, using money to attract others might be seen as inauthentic or manipulative. The author is being open about their tactics with some friends, which they admit, but the friend felt it made them an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are authenticity and consent. If the girls who DM them are aware of the author's intentions and choose to engage, maybe it's not wrong. However, if the author is leading the girls on or not being genuine, that's a problem. The author mentions they're only doing this to get with girls, which could imply they're not being genuine in their interactions. Also, the fact that a friend was shocked and called them an asshole suggests that some people view this behavior negatively.\n\nAnother aspect is the author's behavior being different around friends versus when trying to attract others. This might indicate a lack of authenticity in their approach. While it's common to present oneself in the best light, using wealth specifically to attract others might be seen as exploiting their status. Additionally, the author helps pay for their friends' tuition, which could show they aren't just after money, but the method of using wealth to attract partners is questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, using money to attract others isn't against the law, but it's a social judgment call. Some might see it as honest self-promotion, while others see it as shallow or manipulative. The author's own admission that they sound like a \"huge douche\" suggests some self-awareness of the negative perception.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. Even if the author isn't breaking any rules, their friend's discomfort and the label of \"asshole\" indicate that the behavior is socially unacceptable to some. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just if others disapprove. Since the action is voluntary and not harmful beyond social judgment, the answer might hinge on whether using wealth in this context is considered morally wrong rather than just socially awkward.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't violating any laws, the use of wealth to attract partners could be seen as inauthentic or manipulative, leading others to view them negatively. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) based on social ethics and the friend's reaction.\n"
