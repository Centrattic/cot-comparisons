I'm a trust fund kid, but I'm not good looking and its hard for me to get with girls. I switched to a new tactic of posting my condo, cars, watches, trips on my IG and my followers rose and rose and would get constant DM's from hot girls saying Hi. Been doing this for a year now and I dress better and take my nicer car out more basically to catch girls eyes. I go to trendy places and just talk to girls about my dad's business how I'm gonna join in next year etc. I know I sound like a huge douche but I only do this to get with girls. Other than that I'm a normal guy and all of my friends aren't wealthy at all. I'm actually helping 2 of them pay their tuition and I'm a different person when I'm with them. I take my honda out when we chill, go to normal student bars when we wanna drink etc. I recently told one of my friends about this after she asked how I pull such hot girls, and I spilled the beans. She was shocked and said that I'm probably the biggest asshole/douche in the city. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's a 22-year-old guy from a wealthy family using his money to attract girls on Instagram and in real life. He's showing off his condo, cars, watches, and trips, and dressing up to catch their attention. He's also being a different person when he's with his less wealthy friends, helping them pay tuition and acting more normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Using money to attract romantic interest could be seen as manipulative or insincere. The key issue is whether this is considered wrong. Some might argue that it's his choice how he presents himself and that people are free to pursue relationships in any way they can. Others might say that it's dishonest if he's not being authentic, especially if he's pretending to be more affluent or interested in certain things just to impress girls. \n\nHe also mentions that he's not being genuine when he's with his friends, which might indicate a lack of authenticity in his interactions. The friend's reaction was that he's an asshole for this, so there's a social judgment involved. But does that mean he's objectively in the wrong? The question is subjective, but the answer should be based on common ethical standards.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of transactional relationships. If he's using money to gain attention, is that inherently wrong? It depends on the intentions and the expectations of the other party. If the girls are aware of his status and still engage with him, maybe it's mutual. However, if he's leading them on without genuine intentions, that could be problematic. The post says he's doing it \"only to get with girls,\" which might suggest that his primary goal is to attract them, not to form a meaningful relationship. \n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The AITA community often considers if the person's actions crossed a line or if they were just being honest about their intentions. If he's upfront about his wealth and using it to attract attention, some might see it as just a strategy. However, the deception involved in presenting a false image could be a point against him. Also, the fact that he's acting differently around his friends suggests that he's not being his true self, which might be hypocritical. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as self-serving and insincere, which could make him the asshole. However, others might argue it's a matter of personal choice and that there's no harm if no one is being directly harmed. The key is whether the actions are deceptive or exploitative. Since he's using materialism to attract romantic interest without being authentic, it's likely that the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
