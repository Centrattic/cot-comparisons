Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. She's really tired after a long day, and her boyfriend is disturbing her sleep with his phone use, loud noises, and movements. She tells him to stop, and he apologizes, but it keeps happening. She ends up threatening him and then in the morning tells him she can't sleep with him again. He's upset, but she feels it's necessary because she needs rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman worked a 9-hour shift and coached soccer for two hours, so she's exhausted. It's reasonable for her to need sleep. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, bed shaking\u2014are definitely disruptive. Even after he turns off his phone, the other behaviors continue, like scratching and burping. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't stop, leading her to push him off and eventually tell him she can't sleep in the same bed.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend seems apologetic when asked initially. Maybe he didn't realize how much his actions were disturbing her. The fact that he almost cried in the morning might indicate he felt hurt or upset by her decision. The woman's response of threatening to \"murder\" him is a strong reaction, but given her fatigue, maybe it's understandable. However, threatening violence, even in a sleep-deprived state, is not acceptable. Her final decision to sleep separately is about her health and well-being, which is important.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Her need for rest is valid. 2) Her boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite being told. 3) She communicated her boundaries. 4) The threat of violence is a red flag.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's protecting her health after clearly communicating her needs, she's not in the wrong. However, the threat is problematic. But the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her health and set boundaries. But some might argue the threat of murder is over the line. However, in AITA contexts, the focus is often on the main issue\u2014disruptive sleeping and the consequence. The threat is a reaction, but not the main issue. So, likely B.\n"
