Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend after a rough night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend was doing things like watching videos, being loud, scratching, burping, etc., which disturbed her sleep. She told him to stop, he apologized, but the disturbances continued. She got frustrated, told him she can't do that again, and he was upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points here are her need for sleep due to her busy schedule and the boyfriend's behavior that night. She's tired from work and coaching, which makes her sleep essential. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her request. She communicated her needs, even if it was harsh, and he was upset. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key. She did tell him to stop, but he didn't manage to stop. Maybe there's an underlying issue. But the core issue is her right to rest. If he can't adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, then maybe she's justified in needing her own space. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel hurt by her harsh words, like threatening to murder him. But given the circumstances, her frustration is understandable. The fact that she still loved him in the morning and kissed him shows she cares. \n\nI think the main point is that she's prioritizing her well-being. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries, especially when sleep is crucial for her. The boyfriend's inability to adjust might be an issue on his end too. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
