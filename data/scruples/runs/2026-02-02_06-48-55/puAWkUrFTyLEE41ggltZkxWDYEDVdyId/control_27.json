Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that she's been dating him for a few weeks, and they have a good relationship, but last night was really disruptive. She was exhausted after work and coaching, and he was making a lot of noise and movements in bed, waking her up multiple times. She told him off, and in the morning, she said she can't sleep with him again because of her schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether her decision is justified. The boyfriend was clearly being disruptive\u2014loud noises, shaking the bed, etc. She was extremely tired and needed rest. She communicated her needs to him, and he apologized but the behavior continued. Her reaction was to say she can't sleep with him again, which he took hard.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. In a new relationship, partners are learning each other's habits and boundaries. She has a legitimate need for sleep, especially with her busy schedule. The boyfriend's actions were affecting her well-being. She did try to address the issue directly, giving a warning before deciding to separate. The fact that he almost cried shows he felt hurt, but it's about her right to rest.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If someone's actions consistently interfere with another's health and happiness, it's reasonable to set boundaries. She's not being malicious; she's prioritizing her needs. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but if he can't or won't, her decision to separate sleeping arrangements is valid. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
