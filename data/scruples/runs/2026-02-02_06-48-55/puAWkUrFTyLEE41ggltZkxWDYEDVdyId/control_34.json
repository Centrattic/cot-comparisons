Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that she's been dating him for a few weeks, they have good sex, but the last night he was really disruptive with his phone, noises, movements, and she got very little sleep. She confronted him, he apologized, but it kept happening. She ended up telling him she can't do that again because she needs her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is about shared sleeping space and the disruption caused by the boyfriend's behavior. The author worked a long day and is clearly stressed about her rest. The boyfriend was loud, shaking the bed, scratching, burping, etc., even after being asked to stop. The author felt so exhausted that she threatened him and then decided not to sleep together anymore. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If the boyfriend was being disruptive and she asked him to stop, and he tried to apologize but the problem persisted, then she's justified in setting boundaries. Her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, especially with her work schedule. If the boyfriend's behavior is a recurring issue, she has the right to prioritize her needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected. The fact that he almost cried shows he was upset. However, the author isn't rejecting the relationship; she's just setting a boundary for her own well-being. There's no indication she's being unreasonable. The boyfriend should have been more considerate from the start. \n\nThe context is also that they've only been dating a few weeks. Maybe this was their first time sleeping together. The author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. She's not being inconsiderate; she's taking responsibility for her needs. The boyfriend might need to work on his habits if he wants to maintain a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking care of herself. The boyfriend's behavior was the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
