Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation described is that the author (23F) is exhausted after a long day, and her boyfriend (26M) is making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep. She tells him to turn off his phone initially, but he continues to be disruptive throughout the night, leading her to eventually declare she can't do it again and that she might even hurt him if he disturbs her again. In the morning, she expresses her love but sets boundaries about sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is clearly in a new relationship (a couple of weeks). She's been through a tough day, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014noisy phone use, loud burps, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014is disruptive. She tried to communicate her needs but to no avail. The next morning, she communicates her need for sleep again, which is a reasonable request.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Some might argue that in a new relationship, sleeping separately might be too extreme, especially if the issue is communication. Others might think that her health and well-being are important, and if he's not respecting her needs even after being asked, she's justified in setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might be seen as a sign of emotional sensitivity, but it's also his own responsibility to consider her needs. \n\nThe author isn't being hostile; she's being honest about her needs. The boyfriend's actions were repeatedly disturbing her rest, which is crucial for her well-being. She's prioritizing her health, which is a valid reason. Even though the relationship is new, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If he can't adjust his behavior, then her decision to sleep separately is a logical step to maintain her health and the relationship's stability.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs, and when they weren't met, she took action to protect her well-being. The boyfriend's behavior was the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
