Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 23-year-old female in a two-week relationship with a 26-year-old male. They have good sex and the guy is described as sweet and good. However, after a long day of work and coaching, she's trying to sleep but he's being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, etc. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but he continues to disturb her throughout the night. She gets frustrated and in the morning tells him she can't sleep with him again, leading to him almost crying.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, communication is key in relationships. The author tried to communicate her needs, but maybe she could have addressed the issues before the final decision. However, the boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive, and she's in a physically demanding job. Sleep is crucial, and after multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed, her decision to separate might be justified.\n\nIs it reasonable for her to set boundaries? Yes, especially if her health and well-being are at stake. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) suggests he might not understand why she's doing this, but that doesn't make her wrong. She's prioritizing her needs, which is important in any relationship. The fact that they've only been dating a few weeks also matters\u2014some issues might need more time to address, but if they're fundamental (like sleep quality), it's valid to set boundaries early.\n\nOn the other side, maybe she could have discussed the problem more calmly before cutting things off. But given the context of her exhaustion and the repeated disturbances, it's understandable that she reached a breaking point. The key is whether her action was a reasonable response to a recurring problem that wasn't resolved through communication. Since she tried to talk to him and he apologized but didn't stop, her final action is a self-care measure. So, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
