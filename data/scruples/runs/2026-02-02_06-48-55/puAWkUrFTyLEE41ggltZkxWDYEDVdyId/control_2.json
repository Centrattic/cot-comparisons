Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. They had a good time, but last night, she was really tired after a long day. She tried to sleep, but her boyfriend was being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, etc. She told him to stop, he apologized and turned off his phone, but the disturbances continued all night. She was kept awake and even threatened to kill him if he did it again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again but still loves him. He was almost in tears, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The woman communicated her needs clearly: she asked him to turn off his phone and stop the noises. He tried to comply but the disturbances continued. So maybe he wasn't able to control his actions, or maybe he didn't realize how disruptive he was. Either way, she's setting a boundary for her well-being, especially after a long day. Her health and rest are important; she's working and coaching, so she needs sleep. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend felt hurt or rejected when she told him she couldn't sleep with him again. But her reasoning is about her needs, not about rejecting him personally. She still affirmed her love, so it's not about being cruel. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he felt hurt, but the root issue is her need for rest. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that people should be able to handle sleeping in the same bed regardless of the circumstances? Maybe, but relationships require mutual respect and accommodation. If one partner's behavior is affecting the other's health, that's a valid concern. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe she should have been more understanding or tried to find a compromise, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. But given that she had a valid reason (extreme tiredness) and communicated her needs, she's not necessarily in the wrong. Also, it's early in the relationship, so maybe they're still figuring out boundaries. \n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's actions might be beyond his control, like if he has a medical condition causing the scratching, burping, etc. However, the post doesn't mention that. It's possible she's being too harsh, but her reaction is to a very real problem. \n\nIn general, setting boundaries for one's health is justified. If the boyfriend is willing to adjust his behavior, that's good, but if it's a recurring issue, the woman has the right to prioritize her rest. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend might need to reflect on his actions, but she's justified in asserting her needs.\n"
