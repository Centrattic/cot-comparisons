Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 23-year-old woman, telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore after a night of disturbances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a very long day at work and coaching soccer, which probably left her exhausted. When she went to bed, her boyfriend engaged in behaviors that kept her awake: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too hard. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued throughout the night. The next morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because of her schedule and her need for rest. He was upset, but she felt justified because she was tired.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the circumstances. The boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive. Even after being asked to turn off his phone, the disturbances continued. The author's need for sleep is significant, especially after a long workday. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries to protect her health and well-being. However, the way she addressed it might come across as harsh. She mentioned threatening to murder him if he woke her again, which is extreme. But in the morning, she apologized and reassured him she still loved him. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate he's sensitive, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. The author had already tried to resolve the issue by asking him to stop, and when that failed, she made a decision to sleep separately. This is a reasonable step if co-sleeping isn't working out. It's important to note that in a healthy relationship, both partners should accommodate each other's needs. If the boyfriend is causing consistent disturbances, the author is within her rights to seek a solution that prioritizes her rest, especially if it's affecting her health and work. \n\nOn the other hand, ideally, they could find a compromise, like separate beds temporarily until the boyfriend can adjust his habits. But given the circumstances, the author's action seems justified. She communicated her needs clearly and explained the reason (her schedule and tiredness), which shows she's not being selfish but rather taking care of her needs. The boyfriend's behavior was the root cause here, so the blame isn't on her for wanting a solution that works for both, even if it's sleeping apart for now. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She had valid reasons and communicated her needs, even if the method was a bit harsh. The boyfriend's actions were the main issue.\n"
