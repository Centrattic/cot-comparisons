Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that the boyfriend was being disruptive during their first night together. She worked a long shift and was exhausted, and his behavior affected her sleep. She told him to turn off his phone and he did, but he kept disturbing her all night with scratching, burping, etc. She threatened to murder him if he did it again, and in the morning, she told him she can't sleep together anymore even though she loves him. The boyfriend was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is tired and works a lot, needing rest. Her job requires good sleep. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive\u2014maybe he wasn't aware of how his actions were affecting her. He apologized and tried to turn off the phone, but the other behaviors continued. She had to set a boundary because her health and schedule are important. \n\nIs it fair for her to end the bed-sharing? Well, in a relationship, partners should consider each other's needs. If the boyfriend was unaware of his behaviors, maybe he needs to be more mindful. But she's taking steps to protect her well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction might be emotional, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. The key here is that she communicated her needs and tried to be kind, even after the stressful night. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. She's prioritizing her health and rest, which is essential. The boyfriend should work on his habits or maybe they can find a solution, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. But she's not wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer should be B.\n"
