Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that the guy is making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep after a long day. She asked him to turn off his phone and he did, but he kept being disruptive. She eventually threatened him and told him she can't do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked long hours and needs rest, which is valid. Disturbances like loud noises and shaking the bed can really affect someone's sleep, especially after a tiring day. On the other hand, the boyfriend might be unaware of how his actions are affecting her, and he apologized and tried to change his behavior. However, he kept disturbing her again. The author's response was to set a boundary by telling him not to sleep in the same bed again. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is important in a relationship. If someone's actions are affecting your well-being, it's reasonable to express that. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but the author is taking steps to prioritize her health. However, the way she told him (threatening to murder him) might be a bit harsh, but that's a separate issue. The main point is her right to have rest. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate, but the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
