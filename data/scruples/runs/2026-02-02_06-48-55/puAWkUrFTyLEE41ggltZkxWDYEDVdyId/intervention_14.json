Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation described is that the author (23F) has been dating a guy (26M) for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but last night was rough. The guy was being noisy and disruptive, making her too tired to sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept making noises and shaking the bed all night. She got angry and threatened him, then in the morning told him she couldn't sleep with him again. He was upset, but she still feels it's necessary because she needs her sleep.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. My job is to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is dealing with sleep issues due to her partner's behavior. She's been up all night because of his actions. She's clearly exhausted and has a busy schedule. She communicated her needs to him, which he tried to address but continued to disrupt her. She threatened him in frustration, then in the morning explained her position. He was hurt by this.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Is it reasonable for someone to have their own space to sleep? Yes, especially if their partner's habits are affecting their health. Sleep is crucial, and chronic lack of sleep can have serious consequences. The author is advocating for her own well-being here. However, the way she communicated it might have been harsh\u2014threatening to murder him isn't appropriate. But given the context of exhaustion, maybe that's a momentary lapse in judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He was disruptive despite her asking him to stop. Even after apologizing, he continued to disturb her. That's on him. But the author's response was to end the shared sleeping arrangement. Is that too quick? Well, she's been dealing with this for a night and made a decision based on her needs. She's not wrong to prioritize her sleep. Maybe she could have discussed it more calmly, but her main point is valid.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that a few weeks into a relationship, this is too hasty, or that the author should have tried to work it out. But the author's health and well-being are important. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author is taking a stand for herself. The threat part might be a red flag, but the core issue is about respecting boundaries.\n\nSo, weighing it out: The author is not in the wrong because she's addressing a legitimate need for rest. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author is prioritizing her health. The way she expressed her frustration could be improved, but the decision itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
