Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because of his disruptive behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (23F) worked long hours and is clearly exhausted. She's had a tough day with work and coaching, so her need for sleep is valid. The boyfriend (26M) is doing things like watching videos loudly, making noises, scratching, and shaking the bed. She asks him to stop, he apologizes but continues, leading to her being pushed to her limit. She then tells him she can't do that again, even threatening to murder him if he wakes her up more. The next morning, she apologizes but still tells him she can't sleep together.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions: burping, scratching, shaking the bed, and loud noises. These are disruptive and might indicate he's either not aware of his behavior or maybe has some health issues. She tried to communicate her needs, and he didn't follow through, leading to her frustration. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She did communicate her need for rest, which is important. He didn't adjust his behavior despite her requests. However, her response of threatening violence, even if in frustration, is extreme. But considering her exhaustion, maybe her reaction is understandable. \n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Her actions stem from a legitimate need for rest, which is crucial for her well-being. She's also given him a chance to correct his behavior, which he didn't. So, she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend is responsible for respecting her needs. \n\nHowever, her immediate reaction of threatening to murder him might be seen as harsh, but given the context, it's a hyperbolic expression of frustration rather than a literal threat. The morning after, she apologized and explained her schedule. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might suggest he didn't realize the impact of his actions. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to adjust. But since she's communicated her needs and he didn't comply, her decision to not sleep in the same bed is a boundary she's entitled to set. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
