Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but last night was a problem. She was really tired after work and coaching, and he kept making noise and disturbing her sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but then he continued scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She tried to get him to stop cuddling too hard. At 5am, she threatened to kill him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule and she loves him, but he almost cried.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that she's prioritizing her need for sleep over staying in the same bed. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, she's exhausted and her job is demanding. Sleep is crucial for her health and ability to work. On the other hand, her boyfriend might feel rejected or hurt because she's ending the shared sleeping arrangement. But given the context, she's being honest about her needs. He might need to adjust his habits if they want to continue sleeping together. However, she's setting a boundary that's necessary for her well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate that he's not used to being told \"no,\" but that doesn't make her wrong. She's communicated her needs clearly and is taking responsibility by saying she still loves him. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. She's addressing a problem she has, which is valid. He might need to work on his nighttime habits, but if he can't, then her decision to not sleep with him is reasonable. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong because she's asserting her need for sleep and setting boundaries for her own health, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend may need to adjust, but that's on him. She's not at fault for prioritizing her well-being.\n"
