Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's exhausted after work and coaching, and her boyfriend keeps disturbing her sleep with various noises and movements. She tells him to turn off his phone, but he still keeps making noise all night. She ends up pushing him off when he cuddles too hard and even threatens him in the morning. Then she apologizes and says she can't do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is clearly tired and overworked, which is a valid reason to need rest. Her job requires a lot of physical activity, and not getting enough sleep could affect her performance. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior seems disruptive. He's making loud noises, scratching, and moving around, which are all things that could interfere with someone trying to sleep. He apologized when told to turn off his phone but didn't stop other behaviors. That might indicate he didn't fully address the problem.\n\nThe woman's response is to push him off when cuddling and eventually tells him she can't sleep with him. Her threat of \"murder\" was probably in a joking or frustrated way, but she does apologize. The boyfriend is hurt by this and almost cries, showing he was affected by her words. \n\nNow, is the woman in the wrong? Well, she's trying to communicate her needs, which is reasonable. She's in a new relationship, so boundaries are still being set. It's important to respect each other's needs. If he's being disruptive despite her requests, she's justified in setting a boundary. However, the way she communicated it might have been harsh, especially the threat. While she apologized, the immediate reaction could be seen as excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might need to be more considerate of her needs, especially since she's working so hard. He might not realize how his actions are affecting her. Maybe he's not aware of his habits or how loud he's being. So the blame isn't entirely on one side. \n\nThe key points are mutual consideration. The woman is justified in needing rest, and her boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior. But the way she communicated her needs was a bit harsh, even if she apologized. However, given the circumstances, she's not entirely wrong. Relationships require communication, and she's trying to express her needs. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She's setting boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n"
