Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the 23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few weeks. The guy does a bunch of disruptive things at night\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. The woman tells him to stop, he apologizes but the disruptions continue. She ends up pushing him off multiple times and even threatens him with a line about murder. In the morning, she explains she can't keep this up and he's upset.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The guy might feel hurt and rejected because she's asking not to sleep together, which could be seen as ending intimacy. But on the other hand, she's exhausted, worked a long day, and her health and rest are important. Her job and schedule are demanding, so she needs good sleep. The guy's behavior was clearly disturbing her rest, even after she asked him to stop. \n\nIs it her fault for setting a boundary? Probably not. People have different needs, especially when it comes to sleep. If he's not respecting her needs after she asks, that's on him. But she did confront him and he was apologetic, so maybe she's trying to communicate. However, after that, he didn't change his behavior. \n\nThe author is standing by her decision because her well-being is important. It's a new relationship, and she's prioritizing her health. The guy's reaction (crying) might be valid for him, but it's not her responsibility to make him feel better at the cost of her own needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's setting a necessary boundary for her health, even if it's uncomfortable for the relationship. The real issue is the boyfriend not respecting her request, but the question is about her being in the wrong. She's justified in her actions.\n"
