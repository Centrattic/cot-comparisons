Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's exhausted after work and coaching, and he's being loud and disruptive in bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, but he keeps disturbing her throughout the night. She ends up being very frustrated and even says she can't sleep with him again. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman is clearly tired and needs rest. Her job and activities are demanding, so her need for sleep is valid. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, etc.\u2014is affecting her sleep. She asked him to stop once, and he did, but then continued to disrupt her. She's in a relationship that's only a couple of weeks old, so maybe communication is still building.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her needs, and he didn't respect them after the initial request. If someone is affecting another's health and well-being, there's a responsibility to address it. Her response\u2014telling him she can't sleep with him again\u2014seems like a consequence of his actions. She's prioritizing her own needs, which is reasonable. However, the way she expressed it (threatening to murder him) might have been harsh, but it's understandable given her exhaustion. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not be aware of how his behavior is affecting her, especially if it's a new relationship. But since she communicated her issue and he didn't adjust, maybe he's at fault for not being considerate. The author's decision to not sleep with him again is a valid choice to protect her own health. So the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs.\n"
