Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is she's with her boyfriend of a few weeks. They had a good time, but last night was rough for her. She worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she was super tired. When they were in bed, he was being disruptive: watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept waking her up with his movements and noises. Eventually, she got so fed up she threatened to kill him if he did it again. In the morning, she said she couldn't do that again because of her schedule and she needed sleep, but still loved him. He was upset, and she feels bad but also frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She worked a 9-hour shift and then coached for 2 hours. That's a lot, so she's exhausted. Sleep is crucial for her, especially with her busy schedule. The boyfriend's actions repeatedly disturbed her sleep, which is important for her well-being. She asked him to stop once, which he did, but then continued to disturb her throughout the night. At that point, she set a boundary by threatening him, which is a strong reaction but from a place of desperation.\n\nNow, from his perspective, he might be trying to adjust to her needs. He was apologetic after she asked him to turn off the phone. However, his actions kept disrupting her, possibly because he wasn't aware of how much he was affecting her. He might not have realized the extent of his actions' impact on her sleep. His reaction in the morning (crying) shows he felt hurt by her words, which might indicate that he wasn't expecting such a strong reaction.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her needs to him. She told him to turn off his phone and he did, but the problem persisted. She then set a clear boundary, which is her right. She's prioritizing her health and sleep, which are important. However, threatening someone with violence, even in frustration, can be a red flag. But considering the context\u2014extreme fatigue and repeated disruptions\u2014her frustration is understandable. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't fully meet them. So her decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. He might need to be more considerate in the future, but she's within her rights to prioritize her rest. The answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
