Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 23-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's been dating him a few weeks, sex is good, but he's been disruptive at night. She's exhausted from work and coaching. He's making noise, shaking the bed, etc. She asks him to stop, he apologizes but continues. She's pushing him off when he cuddles. Finally, she threatens to murder him if he does it again. In the morning, she tells him she can't do that again, he almost cries, she feels bad but says fuck it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: her need for sleep, his disruptive behavior, her communication of her needs, and the emotional responses.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn her side: She's working long hours, needs rest. She tried to communicate her needs, he didn't respect them. Her reaction (threatening to murder) was an extreme response, but it's in a moment of frustration. She's clear in the morning about needing her schedule to be respected. She does express love and feels bad, but her priority is her health and sleep.\n\nOn his side: He might be unaware of how disruptive his actions are. He apologized, tried to change, but maybe didn't realize the full extent. His emotional reaction (crying) shows he's hurt by her rejection.\n\nBut the main issue is respect for her boundaries. She communicated her need for sleep, and he didn't fully comply. Her decision to not sleep together again is her way of setting a boundary. In relationships, partners need to respect each other's needs. Sleep is essential for health, and if he can't adjust, it's reasonable for her to seek a separate sleeping arrangement. The problem might be that the relationship is new, so maybe they need to work on communication. However, she's not wrong for prioritizing her well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and she's justified in setting a boundary.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
