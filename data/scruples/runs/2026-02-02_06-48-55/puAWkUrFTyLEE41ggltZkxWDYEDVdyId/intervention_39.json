Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks and decides she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed as him because he's causing her to lose sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She works long hours and coaches soccer, so she's exhausted. He's making noises, moving around, scratching, and it's disrupting her sleep. She told him to turn his phone off and he apologized, but the problem continued. She ended up being very frustrated and even said she'd murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, thinking about whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, communication is key in relationships. She did tell him to turn off his phone, but he wasn't able to control his other behaviors. She's justified in needing her sleep, especially with her busy schedule. It's reasonable for her to need a good night's rest to function. If he's not able to adjust his habits, maybe they need to find a solution together. However, moving out of the bed might be a quick fix, but it could also be seen as a bit abrupt, especially since they're in a new relationship. Maybe she could have discussed it more calmly first. But given the circumstances, she's clearly exhausted and her health and well-being matter. It's her right to set boundaries for her own rest. So I think she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
