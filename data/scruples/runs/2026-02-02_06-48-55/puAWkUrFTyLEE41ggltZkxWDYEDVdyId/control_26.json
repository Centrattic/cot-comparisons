Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe woman is 23, her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few weeks. She's been working long hours and coaching, so she's very tired. When they're in bed, he's making a lot of noise and being disruptive\u2014watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. She gets so fed up she almost threatens him. In the morning, she tells him she can't sleep with him again because she needs rest, even though she still loves him. He's upset, but she feels justified.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think. \n\nFirst, she's exhausted from work and coaching. It's reasonable for her to need good sleep. The boyfriend's behavior is disruptive\u2014he's being loud, shaking the bed, etc. Even after she asks him to stop, he continues, leading her to be pushed to her limit. She's honest with him in the morning about needing space for sleep. She's not rejecting him for a long time; just a few weeks. She's also showing that she still cares by kissing him and saying she loves him.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have communicated differently? But given the circumstances\u2014she's been up all night, stressed, and he's not respecting her need for sleep. She's not being malicious. Her main concern is her health and well-being. Her boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean her response is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respect for each other's needs are key. If one partner's actions are consistently affecting the other's health, it's valid to set boundaries. She's not being cruel; she's being honest about her limits. So, I think she's in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
