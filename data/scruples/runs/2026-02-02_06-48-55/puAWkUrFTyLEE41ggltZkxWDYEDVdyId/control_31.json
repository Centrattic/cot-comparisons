Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating her boyfriend for a couple of weeks. They had a good time, but last night, she was really tired after work and soccer coaching. He was being loud with his phone, scratching a lot, burping, shaking the bed, and it kept waking her up. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the noise continued. In the morning, she said she can't sleep with him again because she needs her sleep, and he almost cried. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is clearly exhausted from her work and activities, and her health and well-being are important. She communicated her needs, which is a positive step. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected because she's asking not to sleep together. He did apologize after she asked him to turn off his phone, but the disruptions continued. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The woman had a valid reason\u2014she needed sleep. She tried to address the issue calmly, and when that didn't work, she set a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying shows he's affected by her decision, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. Relationships require compromise, and in this case, her health and necessary rest might take precedence. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social expectations that might influence this. Generally, respecting each other's needs is crucial in a relationship. If the boyfriend's behavior is beyond typical habits (like loud noises and shaking the bed), it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. However, since the relationship is only a couple of weeks old, maybe there's an adjustment period. But given the severity of the disruptions, it's not unreasonable for her to prioritize her rest.\n\nAnother angle: could she have handled it differently? Maybe suggesting a different sleeping arrangement temporarily, but she did explain her reasons and showed she still loves him. The boyfriend's crying might indicate he's not handling the situation well emotionally, but that's his reaction, not her fault. \n\nIn conclusion, she's not in the wrong. She communicated her needs and set a boundary for her well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
