Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, making noises, shaking the bed\u2014clearly disrupted her rest. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept making noises and cuddling her in a way that woke her up. She was honest about her needs and set a boundary, even mentioning a threat in a joking way.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected by her decision to not share a bed. He cried, which shows emotional distress. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The woman clearly communicated her needs due to her physical exhaustion, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's actions were the initial problem, but the woman's response was to protect her well-being.\n\nIn relationships, it's important both partners feel respected. If one partner consistently disrupts the other's rest without consideration, that's a problem. However, the woman is setting a boundary to take care of her health, which is reasonable. The boyfriend should adapt to her needs, especially given the short duration of the relationship. So, the woman isn't in the wrong here. Her actions are about self-care and clear communication, which are important in any relationship.\n"
