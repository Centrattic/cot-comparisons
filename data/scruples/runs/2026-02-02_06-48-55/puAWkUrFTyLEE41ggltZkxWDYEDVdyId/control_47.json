Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. They had a good time, including good sex, but last night was a problem. She was really tired after work and soccer coaching. In bed, he was making a lot of noise with his phone, burping, scratching loudly, shaking the bed, and cuddling too hard, keeping her awake. She told him to stop, he apologized, but it kept happening. In the morning, she told him she can't do it again and needs sleep, even though she still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is also exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions are justified. She had a long day and needed rest. The boyfriend's behaviors were disruptive and affected her ability to sleep. She communicated her needs, and when that didn't help, she set a boundary. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for personal well-being. Even though they are in a new relationship, her need for sleep is valid. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't negate her right to a good night's sleep. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have been more patient or communicated earlier. But considering she was exhausted and had already asked him to stop, it's reasonable she set a firm boundary. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's needs. If he's not respecting her need for rest after being told, then her stance is justified. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
