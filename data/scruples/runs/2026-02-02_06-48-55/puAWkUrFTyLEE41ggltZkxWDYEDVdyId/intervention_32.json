Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a night of disturbances. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend was loud, shaking the bed, scratching, etc., which kept the author awake. She asked him to turn off his phone and he did, but the disturbances continued. She's exhausted from work and coaching. Her actions were to set a boundary for her well-being, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel rejected or hurt by her decision to not sleep together again. The author mentioned he almost cried, indicating emotional impact. However, she also apologized and said she still loves him, showing she's considerate of his feelings.\n\nKey points: The author's need for rest is valid, especially given her schedule. Everyone has different sleep needs and boundaries. While the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, the author's response was to protect her health, which is her right. The boyfriend should have been more mindful of her needs, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own well-being. There's no indication she was rude or disrespectful beyond stating her needs. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
