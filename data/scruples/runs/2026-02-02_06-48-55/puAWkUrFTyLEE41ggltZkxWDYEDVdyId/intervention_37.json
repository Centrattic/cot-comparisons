Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who's been dating for a few weeks. The woman was really tired after a long day of work and coaching, and her boyfriend's nighttime habits disturbed her sleep. She told him to stop, he tried to be apologetic, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening him and the next morning told him she couldn't sleep with him again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the woman had a long day and needed rest, which is important for her well-being. Her communication was clear: she told him to turn off his phone and stop the noises, but he kept doing things that kept her awake. That's a problem because respecting each other's needs in a relationship is crucial. If he's not respecting her boundaries, that's on him. Her final decision to not sleep in the same bed anymore is her way of setting a boundary to protect her health and schedule.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have addressed the issue more calmly. Threatening to murder someone in a relationship is certainly not appropriate and might escalate tensions. Also, her reaction the next day with the kiss and apology shows she still cares, but the way she communicated her frustration at 5 AM might not have been the best approach. However, given the context of extreme fatigue and repeated disturbances, her actions might be seen as a last resort.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key factors are communication, mutual respect, and the context of her tiredness. While her immediate reaction (threatening to murder) is extreme, her overall decision to set a boundary for her well-being isn't. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and she's taking steps to address it. So, the author might not be in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer would likely be B (No). But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking any nuances. Maybe the way she handled the situation could be improved, but the core issue is about her right to rest and his failure to respect that. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
