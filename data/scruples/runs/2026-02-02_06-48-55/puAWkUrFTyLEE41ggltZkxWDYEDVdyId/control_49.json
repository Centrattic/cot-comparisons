Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman (23F) who's dating a guy (26M) for a couple of weeks. They had a good time, including sex, but last night was rough for her. She worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's very tired. When they go to bed, he's doing these disruptive things\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue throughout the night. She ends up being pushed to the point of telling him she might murder him, and in the morning, she kisses him but says she can't sleep with him again, making him cry. The question is, is she in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman's perspective is that she's exhausted and needs sleep, which is crucial for her health and work. The guy's actions throughout the night are interfering with her rest, which she has to prioritize. On the other hand, the guy might feel hurt that she's pushing him away, especially after she kisses him in the morning and says she still loves him. He's crying, so he might feel rejected or not appreciated.\n\nBut the main issue here is her need for sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The guy's behavior, even if unintentional, is preventing her from getting the rest she needs. She communicated her needs clearly at the time, and again in the morning. She's not rejecting him; she's stating her requirements. Her actions are about self-care and maintaining her well-being, which is important in any relationship.\n\nRelationships require mutual respect for each other's needs. If he's scratching, burping loudly, and moving a lot during sleep, maybe there's an underlying issue, like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, that he needs to address. But she's not responsible for his health problems. She's within her rights to set boundaries, especially regarding her own health. The fact that she's upfront about it and shows affection in the morning suggests she's not trying to be cruel but is prioritizing her needs.\n\nThe other side might argue that he's trying to be affectionate with cuddling, but if it's causing her to wake up, that's not helpful. She's explaining her schedule is \"crazy\" implying she's already under stress. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs, and he's left feeling upset, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. Everyone has limits, and it's okay to enforce them, especially for health reasons.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's justified in setting boundaries for her well-being. The guy needs to understand and accommodate her needs, possibly by addressing his own sleep habits or seeking medical advice if necessary. She's not at fault here.\n"
