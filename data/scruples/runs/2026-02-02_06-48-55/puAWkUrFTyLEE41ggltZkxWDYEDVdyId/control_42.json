Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend after a bad night's sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a woman in a new relationship. Her boyfriend was loud, scratching, burping, making her sleepless. She asked him to stop, he tried but it kept happening. She ended up telling him she can't do that again despite loving him. He was upset.\n\nThe main question is whether she's wrong for saying she doesn't want to sleep together. Let's break it down. She's exhausted from work and coaching. Communication is key in relationships. She did tell him to stop the noises and he apologized but the problem persisted. She was clear in the morning about her needs. He reacted emotionally, which is valid but she's prioritizing her health.\n\nIn a new relationship, boundaries are being set. It's important to respect each other's needs. If he's making noises that disrupt her sleep, it's a legitimate concern. She's not being unreasonable by stating her needs, especially when she's working long hours. However, maybe there's room for empathy from both sides. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she communicated her needs and the situation was affecting her well-being, she's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
