Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few weeks, and the sex is good, but she's been working long hours and coaching. Last night, she was exhausted and went to bed. Her boyfriend was doing a lot of things that disturbed her sleep\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but throughout the night, his actions kept waking her up. He tried to cuddle, which she pushed him away from. By 5 AM, she was so frustrated she told him she'd murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she couldn't do that again because of her schedule but still loved him. He was upset, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, making it hard for the author to get the rest she needed. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that didn't work, she took action to protect her sleep. But is that inconsiderate?\n\nOn one hand, she's being honest about her needs, especially given her busy schedule and the physical demands of her job. She's in a new relationship, so setting boundaries early is important. She did apologize in the morning, showed affection, and clarified her feelings, which suggests she's not being malicious but rather prioritizing her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sleeping separately so soon in a relationship could be hurtful, especially if the boyfriend is genuinely trying to adjust. However, if his actions repeatedly disrupted her sleep despite her requests, maybe the issue isn't just about sleeping arrangements but about respecting her needs. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he felt rejected or that she's not interested in the relationship progressing. But the author's health and rest are also valid.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Considering that she communicated her needs and the circumstances (extreme fatigue, work schedule), it seems she's prioritizing her health. While it's early in the relationship, her actions are about maintaining her well-being, which is a legitimate concern. So, I think the answer is B (no, she's not in the wrong). She's not being inconsiderate; she's setting boundaries for her own rest, which is necessary. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior if they continue to cohabit, but the author isn't wrong for choosing her needs in this situation.\n"
