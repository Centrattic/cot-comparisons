Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman (23F) who is in a new relationship with a guy (26M). She's been working long hours and coaching soccer, leading to her being very tired. When they're in bed, he's making noises and movements that disturb her sleep. She tells him to stop, he apologizes but the disturbances continue. She even threatens to murder him if he does it again. In the morning, she explains that she can't keep doing this and still loves him, but he's upset.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. She's exhausted from her work and coaching. His behavior during the night is disruptive\u2014scratching, burping, bed shaking, etc. She asked him to stop, he tried to comply but the disturbances continued. She's honest about her feelings and communicates her needs, even if it's blunt. He's a new partner, so perhaps they're still learning each other's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She told him she needed to sleep and that his actions were disturbing her. He was apologetic but the problem persisted. Her response of saying she can't do it again is a clear boundary. While her wording might be harsh (\"murder him\"), it's an expression of frustration. The next day, she's apologetic and clarifies her feelings.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's within her rights to ask her partner to be considerate of her sleep needs. However, the way she communicated her frustration (threatening language) might be problematic. But given her exhaustion, maybe it's understandable. The main issue is whether her actions were justified in setting boundaries. Since she communicated her needs and followed up the next day, she's not in the wrong. The man should have adjusted his behavior to accommodate her needs once she asked. Her setting a boundary isn't wrong; the man's failure to respect her needs after being asked is the issue. So, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
