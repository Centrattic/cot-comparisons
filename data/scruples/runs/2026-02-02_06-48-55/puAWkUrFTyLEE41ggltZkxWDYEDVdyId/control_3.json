Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. Their relationship is going well, and they have good chemistry, including sex. However, after a long day at work and coaching, she's exhausted and wants to sleep. The boyfriend, however, is disruptive with his phone use, loud noises, scratching, and shaking the bed. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disruptions continue throughout the night. She ends up getting very frustrated, even threatening to murder him if he does it again. The next morning, she tells him she can't do that again but still loves him, which makes him almost cry. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's need for rest due to her busy schedule, the boyfriend's behavior that's preventing her from sleeping, and her subsequent decision to sleep separately. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She told him once to turn off his phone, which he did, but the other disturbances (scratching, shaking, etc.) continued. Even though he apologized after the first instance, the problem persisted. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since she's working long hours and needs her sleep to function. Her decision to sleep in separate beds isn't just about the immediate situation but also about maintaining her health and well-being. \n\nHowever, one might argue that she could have handled it differently. Maybe she could have discussed the issue more calmly in the morning instead of making a decision in the heat of the moment. Also, considering the boyfriend's reaction (almost crying), it's possible he felt rejected or hurt. But the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for prioritizing her need for rest. Her health and work schedule are valid concerns. If the boyfriend's behavior is chronic and he's not making an effort to reduce his disruptions (other than turning off the phone), then her choice to sleep separately is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is trying his best but has uncontrollable issues (like a medical condition causing the scratching or loud coughing), that might affect the situation. However, the story doesn't mention any such conditions. It seems like he's being inconsiderate with his phone use and other behaviors. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make an effort to accommodate each other's needs. If one partner's behavior is repeatedly affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't wrong for making her health a priority. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might need to reflect on his habits and whether they're respectful towards her needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She communicated her needs, tried to resolve the issue, and when it didn't work, she made a decision to protect her health, which is valid.\n"
