Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's really tired after a long day, and her boyfriend's behaviors in bed are disturbing her sleep. She tells him to turn off his phone and later, after repeated disruptions, tells him she can't do that again. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman worked a 9-hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too hard\u2014clearly disturbed her rest. She communicated her needs, and even though he apologized, the disturbances continued. She eventually had to set a firm boundary, even joking about murder. In the morning, she apologized but stated her needs.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is usually acceptable. She expressed her discomfort and tried to communicate her needs. The boyfriend's behavior was intrusive, and she had a right to rest. While her response might have been harsh (the murder comment), it's understandable given her exhaustion. The key point is whether her actions and words were justified. Since she tried to be polite first and only escalated when he didn't comply, it's more about her needing to prioritize her health. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he didn't realize the impact of his actions. So, she's not in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
