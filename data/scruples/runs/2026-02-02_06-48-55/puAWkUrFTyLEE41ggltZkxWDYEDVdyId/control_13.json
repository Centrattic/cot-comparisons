Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is with her 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating a few weeks, and things are going well. But last night was rough for her. She worked a long day and was exhausted. Her boyfriend kept making noises\u2014watching videos, loud burps, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he still kept waking her up throughout the night with his movements and sounds. She even threatened to murder him if he did it again. In the morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again but still loves him. He almost cried, but she felt bad but also needed sleep.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author had a valid reason: she was extremely tired from work and soccer coaching. Sleep is important for anyone, especially someone with a busy schedule. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, shaking the bed\u2014all contributed to her not being able to rest. She communicated her needs clearly, even after he apologized, but the problem persisted. Her response was to tell him she can't sleep with him again. That's her right to set boundaries for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected, especially since they're in a new relationship. But his behavior was disruptive, and while he apologized, he didn't stop the actions that were affecting her sleep. She had to take action to protect her health and schedule. The threat of murder was clearly hyperbolic, but it shows how frustrated she was. However, the way she handled it in the morning\u2014being honest but still expressing love\u2014seems reasonable. \n\nIs she in the wrong? I don't think so. She had a legitimate need for rest, communicated her concerns, and took steps to enforce her boundaries. The boyfriend's actions were the initial problem. So the answer should be B\u2014No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
