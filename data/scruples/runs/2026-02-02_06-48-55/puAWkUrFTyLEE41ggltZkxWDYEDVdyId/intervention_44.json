Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in her early 20s) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been dating a few weeks, which isn't that long. The man is described as sweet and good, with good sex. The woman had a long day at work and coaching, so she was exhausted. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching loud videos, burping, scratching loudly, shaking the bed, and cuddling too hard\u2014were disruptive. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued throughout the night. She ended up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and in the morning told him she can't do that again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether she's wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nSo, considering the factors: Her need for sleep is valid, especially after a long day. She communicated her request initially, and when he didn't stop, she had to reinforce it. Her reaction in the morning about not sharing a bed might be a boundary, which is her right. However, the threat (\"murder him\") might have been an overreaction, and maybe she could have addressed the issue more calmly in the moment. But considering her exhaustion and the boyfriend's ongoing disruptions despite her initial request, her actions might be justified as self-care. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe they should have discussed it earlier, but given the short relationship, she might not have had the chance. Also, not sleeping in the same bed isn't inherently wrong; people have different sleep habits. The key is whether she's in the wrong for prioritizing her health and well-being. Since her job and responsibilities depend on her rest, her decision seems reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, so her boundary-setting is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
