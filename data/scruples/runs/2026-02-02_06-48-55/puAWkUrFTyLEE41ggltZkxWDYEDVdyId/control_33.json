Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the 23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he kept disturbing her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's behavior during the night\u2014watching videos loudly, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014clearly disturbed her sleep. She tried to communicate her needs, he apologized and turned off the phone, but the disturbances continued. She ended up feeling so frustrated she threatened him, and in the morning told him she can't continue sleeping with him.\n\nNow, considering the key points: She's working long hours and coaching, so sleep is crucial for her. She communicated her needs, but he didn't adjust. The boyfriend seems apologetic but maybe not fully understanding the impact. She's making a decision to prioritize her health and schedule.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's setting a boundary after repeated issues. She apologized and expressed her feelings clearly. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive, and she's choosing to take action to protect her well-being. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
