Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman worked a long shift and coaching, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014noisy phone use, loud burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014clearly disturbed her sleep. She asked him to stop, and he complied initially but continued throughout the night. She felt pushed to the point of threatening him, and in the morning, she decided she can't sleep with him again. \n\nThe boyfriend was apologetic and emotional. The woman feels her needs for rest are important, which is valid, especially with her schedule. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt by her decision, but he was aware of her tiredness and tried to be considerate after her first request.\n\nIs the woman wrong? Well, she communicated her needs and set a boundary. Her actions were a response to repeated disturbances despite his initial apology. She's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is reasonable. The boyfriend, while apologetic, continued to disrupt her sleep, which is inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the woman isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs. The problem lies more with the boyfriend's behavior and maybe his inability to adjust to her requirements. The author is not at fault here. Answer B.\n"
