Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is dating a 26-year-old guy. They've been together a few weeks, and the relationship seems good. The problem happened when she was really tired after work and soccer coaching. She went to bed, but her boyfriend was making a lot of noise\u2014watching videos, loud burps, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued all night. She kept waking up, had to push him off when he cuddled too hard, and finally threatened to kill him. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule, and he almost cried. She feels bad but is also tired.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is clearly tired and stressed from her job. She communicated her needs directly, even if it was harsh. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was disruptive, even after being asked to stop. But the author's response was extreme\u2014threatening to murder him and making him cry. That's pretty harsh communication. However, considering she's exhausted and had a long day, her frustration is understandable. The boyfriend should have respected her need for sleep, especially after being told to stop. But the author's method of expressing her frustration was aggressive and might have been unnecessary. However, in the morning, she apologized and explained her reasons, which shows she wasn't being malicious. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles and mutual respect. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response was overly threatening. However, given the context of her fatigue, maybe her reaction is more about stress than being in the wrong. In relationships, especially new ones, communication is key. The author tried to set boundaries, which is healthy, but the way she expressed it could be problematic. However, her morning follow-up shows she cares and is trying to be understanding. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt attacked, even if he was at fault. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were extreme but perhaps a result of being sleep-deprived and overwhelmed. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. I think the author is not in the wrong because she was protecting her well-being, but her communication method was flawed. However, in the context of the situation, her actions are more justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But wait, the user thinks she's in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, maybe A if her response was too harsh. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but given that she communicated her needs, even if harshly, and followed up with an apology, B makes sense. So the answer is B.\n"
