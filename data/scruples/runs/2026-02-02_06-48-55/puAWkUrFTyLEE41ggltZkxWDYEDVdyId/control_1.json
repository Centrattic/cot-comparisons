Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. She's telling him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because of his disruptive habits during the night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted and needs sleep. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014noises, shaking the bed, scratching, etc.\u2014is clearly disturbing her rest. She told him to stop, he tried to comply but kept waking her up again. She ended up being very frustrated and even threatened him, which made him cry, and now she feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's communicated her needs clearly. She asked him to turn off his phone and stop the noises, but he couldn't help it. She's tired and has a busy schedule, so her need for sleep is valid. The boyfriend's actions are disrupting her, which is a legitimate issue. People have different sleeping habits, and if his behavior is beyond his control (like scratching or loud noises due to medical issues?), maybe she could be understanding, but she's already tried to address it. Her response of not wanting to sleep together again might be a solution she feels necessary for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt because she's rejecting him after a short time. He might feel that she's being harsh, especially since he apologized and tried to fix it. The crying suggests he's emotionally affected, and she might have overreacted. But considering her exhaustion and the cumulative effect of the disturbances, her reaction is understandable.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, and if he can't adjust, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The fact that she still loves him and was apologetic in the morning shows she's not trying to be cruel but is prioritizing her health. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have tried another solution first, like using earplugs or a different sleeping arrangement without cutting him off. But given the context\u2014only a few weeks dating and the severity of the disruptions\u2014her decision to sleep separately might be necessary. \n\nI think the key points are her valid need for sleep, his inability to adjust despite being told, and her communication of her decision. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but her actions are in her own well-being. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
