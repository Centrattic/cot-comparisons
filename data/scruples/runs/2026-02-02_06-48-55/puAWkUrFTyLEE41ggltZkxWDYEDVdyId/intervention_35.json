Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in a new relationship with her boyfriend) is in the wrong for telling him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disrupted her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's been working a long day, 9 hours at work plus 2 hours coaching soccer, which is a lot. She's clearly exhausted and needs rest. Her boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching loud videos, making noise, scratching loudly, shaking the bed, etc.\u2014is affecting her ability to sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued throughout the night. She even mentions considering violence if it happened again. \n\nNow, the key point here is her decision to tell him she can't sleep in the same bed anymore. Is that reasonable? Well, sleep is crucial for health and well-being. If someone's actions are consistently preventing another person from getting adequate rest, that's a valid concern. The boyfriend might not be aware of how his actions are affecting her, but she's communicated her needs. However, in a new relationship (a couple of weeks), this could be seen as an abrupt decision. It's possible that the boyfriend was trying to be accommodating when he turned off his phone but didn't realize other habits were still causing issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman is making a decision based on her own needs. She's communicated her limits, which is important in any relationship. But did she give him enough time or opportunity to adjust? She tried once, and when it didn't work, she decided to separate. That's her right. However, her response of potentially \"murdering him\" and then explaining her reasons in the morning might come across as harsh, but her main point is about needing sleep.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014almost crying\u2014might indicate he's hurt by her decision, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. The core issue is mutual respect for each other's needs. If he's not able to adjust his behavior to allow her to sleep, then her choice to not share the bed is justified. It's about prioritizing her health and well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions stem from legitimate needs that haven't been met despite communication. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, and she's taking steps to protect her health. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
