Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She tells him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night where he kept her up with various noises and movements.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman is exhausted from work and coaching soccer. She's trying to sleep, but her boyfriend's actions\u2014like watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014are disturbing her. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. She even threatens to \"murder him\" if it happens again. The next morning, she tells him she can't do that again because of her schedule but still loves him. He's hurt by her words.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether she's wrong to set this boundary. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The woman is setting a boundary because her needs aren't being met. She's communicated her exhaustion and the specific issues. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he feels hurt, but the core issue is about her need for rest. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, if the boyfriend's behavior is consistently disruptive and she's tried to address it, then her decision to sleep separately isn't unreasonable. It's her way of prioritizing her health and well-being. Maybe there's room for compromise, like using earplugs or finding a way to address his habits, but she's made it clear she needs sleep. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a new relationship, moving to separate beds too quickly might seem abrupt. But given the circumstances\u2014her job demands and the immediate disruption\u2014it seems like a reasonable step. The boyfriend's behavior does need addressing, and she's doing that in a direct way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs after trying to resolve the issue. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but her right to rest is valid.\n"
