Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where a woman is upset with her boyfriend for not letting her sleep because of his behaviors during the night. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, and the sex is great. However, after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and trying to sleep. The boyfriend is doing things like watching loud videos on his phone, making noises, scratching loudly, shaking the bed, and cuddling too hard, waking her up multiple times. She tells him to turn it off, he apologizes, but the problem continues. The next morning, she tells him she can't do this again and that she loves him but needs sleep. He's upset, almost cries, and she feels bad but is still tired.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed? The user says they think so, but they want my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive. He was being loud, shaking the bed, and not respecting her need for sleep after a long day. She communicated her needs, and even though he apologized, he didn't stop. That's a problem because communication is key in relationships. If someone is asked to stop a behavior that's affecting a partner and they can't comply, that's a conflict point.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be unaware of how his actions affect her. He might not be able to control his scratching or the bed shaking, maybe due to a medical condition or something. Also, cuddling is a normal part of a relationship, and if he's trying to be affectionate but it's causing issues, there might be a need for compromise.\n\nBut the main point is that the author is setting a boundary because her needs aren't being met. She's in a new relationship and has a demanding schedule. Sleep is essential, and if her partner isn't able to adjust to that, it's reasonable for her to prioritize her health and well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he didn't realize the extent of the problem, but the author has the right to express her needs.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author did communicate her needs, but if the boyfriend can't meet them, then it's not her fault. She's in a position where she's setting a boundary for her own well-being, which is valid. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the user thinks she's in the wrong. Maybe they believe she should have handled it differently, like giving him more chances or working it out. But the situation is that she's exhausted and has a schedule, so she's justified in needing sleep. The boyfriend's actions are the root cause here. She's not wrong for prioritizing her health, especially in a new relationship where both need to establish boundaries.\n"
