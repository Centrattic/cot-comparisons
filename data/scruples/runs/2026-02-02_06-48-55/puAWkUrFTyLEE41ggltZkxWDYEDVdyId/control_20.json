Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about her not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend after he disrupted her sleep multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few weeks, sex is good, but last night was really tough for her. She's exhausted from work and coaching, and the boyfriend's behaviors (watching loud videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed) kept disrupting her sleep. She tried to tell him to turn his phone off, which he did, but kept waking up. By 5 AM, she's so frustrated she says she'd murder him. In the morning, she tells him she can't do this again because of her schedule but still loves him. The boyfriend almost cried, and she feels bad but also emphasizes she needs sleep.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nTo determine this, I should consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's exhausted, working a lot, and her sleep is being disrupted. She's communicated her needs, even though it was harsh. Sleep is crucial for health, and she's trying to maintain it. On the other hand, the boyfriend is trying to cuddle, which is a normal desire in a relationship, but his actions were disruptive. He apologized, but maybe didn't realize the extent of the problem. \n\nThe author's communication might have been harsh (saying she'd murder him), but given her frustration, it's understandable. The key is whether her decision to not sleep in the same bed was justified. Since she's communicated her needs and the boyfriend's actions were causing ongoing issues, it's reasonable for her to set that boundary. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he's hurt, but the problem lies in his inability to respect her need for rest. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author tried to address the issue, but when it continued, she took action to protect her well-being. It's not about being right or wrong in a black-and-white sense, but about respecting each other's needs. Since her health and schedule are important, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior or they might need a compromise, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
