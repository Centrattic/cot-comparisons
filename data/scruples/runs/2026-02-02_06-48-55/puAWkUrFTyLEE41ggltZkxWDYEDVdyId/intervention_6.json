Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. They had a good time, but last night, after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and trying to sleep. Her boyfriend is making a lot of noise with his phone, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asks him to stop, he apologizes and turns it off, but throughout the night, he keeps disturbing her sleep again with the same behaviors. He tries to cuddle, which wakes her up. In the morning, she kisses him but says she can't sleep with him again because of her schedule and tells him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. He's upset, but she's justified because she's tired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the woman) is in the wrong. The key factors here are respect, communication, and mutual consideration in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: He was loud, disruptive, and continued to disturb her sleep despite her asking him to stop. His behavior is problematic because it's affecting her rest, which is crucial for her well-being. The fact that he apologized but then kept doing the same things again suggests he didn't take her needs seriously, even after she communicated them clearly.\n\nThe woman's response: She told him she couldn't sleep with him again. That's a significant decision, especially early in the relationship. However, she gave him an opportunity to adjust, and he didn't. Her priority is her health and schedule, which is valid. But the way she communicated it\u2014saying she can't do that again and even threatening to murder him if he kept waking her up\u2014might come off as harsh. However, the context is that she was extremely tired and had given him multiple chances.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship dynamics, both parties have responsibilities. The boyfriend should respect her need for rest and adjust his behavior. The woman is within her rights to set boundaries, especially when her health is at stake. However, the abrupt decision to stop sleeping in the same bed might seem extreme, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. She's in a new relationship, and her needs aren't being met. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's hurt, but if he's contributing to the problem, her prioritizing her well-being is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main issue is the boyfriend's lack of consideration. The woman isn't wrong for standing up for her needs. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one person's actions are consistently harmful, the other is justified in setting boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
