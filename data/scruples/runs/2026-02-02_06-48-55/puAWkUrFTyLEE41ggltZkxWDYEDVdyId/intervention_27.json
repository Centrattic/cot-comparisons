Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times during the night.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she was very tired. Her boyfriend was being loud with his phone, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc., which kept waking her up. She asked him to turn off his phone, he did, but he continued to disturb her throughout the night. She tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard, and eventually threatened him with murder if he did it again. In the morning, she told him she can't do it again because of her schedule but still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is justified because she's tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive. He was making noise, shaking the bed, and being physically intrusive despite her asking him to stop. That's not respectful of her need for rest, especially after such a long day. She had valid reasons for needing sleep, and his actions were causing her distress. Her response\u2014clearly communicating her need to sleep and eventually deciding to sleep separately\u2014is a reasonable way to protect her health and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it differently. She mentioned the threat to murder him, which is extreme. But that was in the heat of the moment after being disturbed all night. The morning conversation seems more measured, where she's honest about her needs. He was crying, so maybe he felt rejected or hurt, but his actions were the root cause. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't respect them. Her decision to sleep separately isn't cruel if it's necessary for her health. The boyfriend's behavior was the initial problem. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
