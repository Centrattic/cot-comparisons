Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman (23F) is in a new relationship with a guy (26M). She's been working long hours and is exhausted. Her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep, and she finally tells him she can't sleep in the same bed anymore. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. She's worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours, so she's very tired. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014are clearly disturbing her sleep. She tried to ask him to stop, and he did initially but then continued to disturb her throughout the night. She ends up pushing him away when he cuddles, and in the morning, she tells him she can't do that again, which makes him upset.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. She's in a new relationship, only a few weeks in. She's prioritizing her health and rest, which is important. Her reaction is justified because she's been clear about her needs. He, on the other hand, didn't respect her boundaries even after she asked him to stop. The fact that he was apologizing but still continued to disrupt her sleep shows a lack of consideration. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Is she being too harsh? Well, she's honest about her feelings and explains her reasons. She also clarifies that she still loves him, so it's not a rejection of the relationship but a boundary for her well-being. Her boyfriend's emotional reaction (almost crying) might indicate he felt rejected or misunderstood, but that doesn't make her wrong. The core issue is mutual respect for each other's needs. If she's not getting the sleep she needs, it's reasonable for her to set that boundary. \n\nAnother angle: communication. She did communicate her needs, even if it was a bit strong in the moment (the \"murder\" comment). Her morning message was more constructive, explaining her schedule and that she still loves him. So she's trying to be clear and kind. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but her stance is valid. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have tried to talk about it more calmly instead of saying she can't sleep in the same bed. However, given the exhaustion and the repeated disturbances, her reaction is understandable. It's also a new relationship, so establishing boundaries early is important to avoid future issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her health and communicated her needs. The boyfriend needs to respect that. So the answer should be B.\n"
