Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is in a new relationship with a guy who's not respecting her need for sleep. She's been working hard and is exhausted, and he's making a lot of noise, shaking the bed, and being loud. She told him to turn off his phone, but he kept disturbing her. She ended up telling him in the morning that she can't sleep in the same bed with him because of her schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She's clearly stressed about her job and responsibilities, needing rest. Her communication was direct when he was being loud, but he didn't stop. She even said she'd murder him if he woke her again. Then she informed him in the morning that she can't sleep in the same bed. That's a big decision, but maybe necessary for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel hurt or rejected. He's a new partner, and she's only been dating him for a couple of weeks. The fact that he apologized when she first told him to stop suggests he's not intentionally trying to be disruptive. But maybe he didn't realize how much his actions were affecting her, or perhaps he's not aware of the best ways to adjust his behavior. The fact that he almost cried shows he took it personally.\n\nI need to balance the needs of both people. She has a valid need for sleep and health, especially with her hectic schedule. Her communication was clear, but maybe she could have discussed the issue before resorting to sleeping separately. However, she might not have had the energy for a longer conversation after being so exhausted. \n\nIs she in the wrong for prioritizing her health? Probably not. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If he's not respecting her boundaries, she has the right to set them. However, the way she communicated it (threatening to murder him) was harsh and might have caused unnecessary hurt. But that's more about the tone than the decision itself.\n\nThe key here is whether her action (not wanting to sleep together) was reasonable given the circumstances. Since he wasn't respecting her needs for sleep, and she made that clear, her decision to sleep separately isn't wrong. She's protecting her well-being, which is important in a relationship. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
