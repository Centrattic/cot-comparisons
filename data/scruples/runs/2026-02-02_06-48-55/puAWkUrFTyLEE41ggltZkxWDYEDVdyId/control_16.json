Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but last night was really disruptive for her sleep. She's exhausted from work and coaching, and he's making noises, shaking the bed, scratching, burping, etc. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening him and then expressed her feelings in the morning.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman is clearly exhausted and her job requires a lot of physical work. Sleep is crucial for her, and she's communicated her needs. The boyfriend, while apologetic, didn't stop the behaviors that kept her awake. He tried to cuddle, which she found disruptive. She set a boundary by saying she can't sleep in the same bed with him because of her schedule and needs.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She's honest about her needs, which is important. She also shows affection in the morning, indicating she still cares. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's hurt, but the woman's health and well-being are also important. She's not being cruel, just firm about her needs. The boyfriend should be considerate of her need for sleep, maybe adjust his habits or find a compromise like sleeping in separate beds temporarily.\n\nIs she in the wrong? If she's communicated her needs and he didn't respect them, she's not wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend's actions disrupted her sleep, which is a basic necessity. Her response, while strong (threatening to \"murder\" him), is a hyperbolic expression of frustration rather than actual aggression. She also took responsibility by saying she still loves him and kissed him in the morning.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. If he can't adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, especially when she's clear about them, then her decision to sleep separately isn't wrong. It's about prioritizing her health. The boyfriend may need to work on his habits or accept the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
