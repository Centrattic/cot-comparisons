Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's really tired from work and soccer coaching, and he's not respecting her need to sleep. He's making noise, shaking the bed, etc. She tells him to stop, he apologizes, but it keeps happening. She ends up saying she can't do that again and he gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's worked a long day and is exhausted. The boyfriend's actions are disruptive. She communicated her needs, but he didn't adjust. However, she then responds with a threat (\"murder him\") and makes a decision to not sleep with him again, which causes him emotional distress.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she had a right to rest, and she tried to communicate. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate. But her response might be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, she's justified in prioritizing her health. The key points are communication and mutual respect. If he didn't take her request seriously, she's right to set boundaries. The threat is a bit extreme but in a moment of frustration. The main issue is his lack of consideration. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
