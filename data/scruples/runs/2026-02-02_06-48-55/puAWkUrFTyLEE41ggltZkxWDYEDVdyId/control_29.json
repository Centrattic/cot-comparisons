Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night. The situation is that the boyfriend was being loud and disruptive, making her sleep poorly. She tells him she can't do that again because she needs her sleep, and he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is exhausted from work and coaching, and her sleep was disturbed multiple times. She communicated her needs clearly and even apologized for her harsh words. On the other hand, the boyfriend was making noises and was apologetic after the first complaint. Maybe he didn't realize how bad it was, or he's not aware of his habits.\n\nIs she being unreasonable? Well, sleep is important, and she's justified in needing rest, especially with her busy schedule. She tried to communicate her needs and even stayed with him in the morning. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. People have different sleep habits, and it's a new relationship. She's not forcing him to leave; she's just setting a boundary for her own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because she's not in the wrong. She's taking care of her health and communicating her needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend might need to adjust his habits or find a solution, like sleeping separately if necessary. It's about mutual respect, and she's standing up for her needs here.\n"
