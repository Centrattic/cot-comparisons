Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me go through the situation again.\n\nSo, the woman (23F) and her boyfriend (26M) have been dating a few weeks. The sex is good, and he's sweet. But last night, she was really tired after work and soccer coaching. He was watching videos on his phone, being loud, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She told him to turn it off, he apologized. But all night, he kept disrupting her sleep with the same behaviors. She tried to push him off when cuddling, and eventually told him she'd murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she said she can't do it again because of her schedule but still loves him. He almost cried, she feels bad but says fuck man, she's tired.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about sleep needs and communication. She worked long hours and needed rest, which is valid. He was being disruptive with his phone and bodily noises. She communicated her needs, but he didn't stop. She then sets a boundary by saying she can't sleep with him again. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for doing that. Well, in a relationship, communication is key. She tried to tell him once, he apologized but didn't change. Then she had to set a firm boundary. Her health and well-being matter. People have different sleep needs and habits. It's not her fault she can't adjust to his current behavior, especially if he didn't make changes after being asked. \n\nHe was being considerate initially, but his actions kept disrupting her. She's justified in prioritizing her rest. The fact that she apologized and mentioned still loving him shows she's being fair. He might need to work on his habits, but that's his responsibility. She's within her rights to set boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
