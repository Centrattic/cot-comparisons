Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author, a woman, telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a night of disturbances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman worked a long shift and then coached soccer, so she's really tired. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, is being noisy with his phone, scratching, burping, etc. She asks him to turn off the phone, and he does, but the disturbances continue throughout the night. She gets pushed awake multiple times, leading to her threatening to kill him. The next day, she tells him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. The boyfriend is upset, crying almost.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. So the question is: is she wrong for setting that boundary?\n\nWell, boundaries in relationships are important. If someone is disrupting your rest, especially when you're working hard and need sleep, it's reasonable to ask for space. The boyfriend's behavior was causing her significant discomfort. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that didn't work, she decided to sleep separately. That seems like a valid step to take care of her own needs. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that she should have tried more solutions first, like using earplugs or a different sleeping position. However, considering she's already exhausted, maybe she can't be expected to handle those things. Also, the boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. She had a right to her sleep.\n\nAnother angle: the relationship is only a couple of weeks old. Maybe setting that boundary so quickly could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The key here is mutual respect. She communicated her needs, and if he can't adjust, sleeping separately is a reasonable compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that in a new relationship, it's part of getting to know each other and working through issues. But if his actions are causing her actual harm (like lack of sleep affecting her work), then it's more about health and well-being. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking care of her needs and communicating them, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend needs to adjust or accept the boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
