Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she's with her boyfriend for a few weeks, and they're having a good time. But last night, she was really tired after work and soccer coaching. Her boyfriend was being loud with his phone, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asked him to turn it off, he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up pushing him off when he cuddled too hard, and threatened to murder him if it happened again. In the morning, she said she couldn't do that again because of her schedule, but she still loves him. He got emotional, and she feels bad but also just wants sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main point is that she needs her sleep because of her hectic schedule. She worked a long shift and coached, so being tired is valid. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014is disruptive. She asked him once to turn off the phone, which he did, but the other noises and actions continued all night. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that didn't work, she set a boundary by pushing him off and eventually stating she can't sleep with him again. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was crying, which might indicate he felt rejected or hurt. However, her main concern was her well-being and health due to her demanding schedule. In relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, but perhaps not in a way that he expected. However, her actions were to protect her need for rest, which is important for her daily functioning. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal boundaries and health, it's reasonable for her to set limits, especially when her work requires her to be rested. The boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive, and if it's a recurring issue, she's entitled to prioritize her sleep. However, perhaps there's a middle ground, like using separate beds temporarily until he can adjust his sleeping habits. But given the circumstances, she's not in the wrong for stating her needs and making a decision to separate if necessary. The answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
