Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about her not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend because he disturbed her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. She's 23, he's 26. They've been dating a few weeks, and the sex is good. But she's exhausted after a long day, and he's making a lot of noise and movements during the night, which is keeping her awake. She told him to turn off his phone, and he did, but the other issues continued. She got so frustrated that she threatened him, and in the morning, she said she can't do that again but still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but also tired.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for telling him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break it down. She's clearly exhausted and has a demanding schedule. Her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, and if he's causing her to lose sleep, that's a valid concern. She communicated her needs, which he tried to address by turning off the phone, but the other issues (scratching, shaking the bed, etc.) weren't resolved. \n\nShe set a boundary by threatening to murder him if he did it again, which is an extreme way to express frustration but understandable given her exhaustion. Then in the morning, she clarified she can't continue sleeping together but still loves him. He was upset, and she feels bad. \n\nIs her request unreasonable? Maybe not. If someone's sleep is being disrupted consistently, it's reasonable to request a change. However, the timing and the way she communicated it might matter. She's in a new relationship, so maybe there's an adjustment period. But given her work schedule and the fact that he's causing her physical discomfort, she's not wrong to prioritize her needs. \n\nHe might need to address his own habits, like maybe he has a medical issue with scratching, or he's not aware of his movements. But she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries for her well-being. So the answer is B, No.\n"
