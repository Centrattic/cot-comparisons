Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because of his disruptive behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girlfriend had a long day, worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours. She's exhausted. Her boyfriend was doing things like watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc., even after she asked him to turn off his phone. He tried to cuddle her, which woke her up. She was so frustrated she said she'd murder him if he did it again. The next morning, she told him they can't sleep together again, and he was upset but she still loves him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. So, the question is whether she's justified in her actions.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's been asked to sleep with someone who's not respecting her need for sleep. She had valid reasons: her schedule is crazy, she needs rest. Her actions were a response to his continued disruptive behavior despite her initial request. The boyfriend apologized and turned off the phone but kept making noise. She set a boundary for her own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt that she's not being understanding or trying to work through the issue. Maybe there's an underlying issue, like he's uncomfortable in bed or has health issues causing the scratching and coughing. But from the description, he was doing things that were preventable, like loud phone use and not respecting her need for sleep after being asked.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. She communicated her needs clearly but he didn't follow through, leading to her frustration. She's not being inconsiderate without reason; she's standing up for her own needs. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he's hurt, but the main issue is about her right to rest. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. She's taking responsibility for her well-being, which is important in a relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
