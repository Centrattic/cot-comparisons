Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a woman is telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he keeps disturbing her sleep with his behaviors. She worked long hours and is exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The woman is clearly tired and her job requires a lot of hours. She's trying to get rest, which is important for her well-being. The boyfriend is doing things like watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc., even after being asked to stop. He seems apologetic but the disturbances continue. She pushes him off when he cuddles too hard, and eventually tells him she can't do this again. In the morning, she explains she needs sleep and he's upset, but she's firm because she's tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Her actions: she communicated her needs clearly, even to the point of being firm. She's prioritizing her health and work schedule, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions are the cause here\u2014his behavior is disrupting her sleep despite her requests. She's not the one causing the problem. While it's true that couples often share a bed, the situation here is that his actions are making it impossible for her to rest. She's setting boundaries for her own well-being, which is reasonable. He's upset, but her need for sleep is legitimate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe she should be more understanding of his habits, or that they can work on solutions together. But given that she's working long hours and her health is at stake, her decision to not sleep together temporarily is justified. Also, he was apologetic, but if he can't adjust his behavior, her boundary is necessary. She's not being inconsiderate; she's stating her needs clearly. So, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
