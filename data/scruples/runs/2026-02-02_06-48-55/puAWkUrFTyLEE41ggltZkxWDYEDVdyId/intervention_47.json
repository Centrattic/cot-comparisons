Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's exhausted from work and soccer coaching, and in the middle of the night, her boyfriend's actions are keeping her awake. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but then continues making noise and disturbing her sleep. She ends up pushing him off when he cuddles too hard and even threats to murder him if he wakes her again. The next morning, she tells him she can't do that again but still loves him. He's upset, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and reasonable expectations in a new relationship. The author is clearly in a new relationship, and they haven't been together very long. She's working long hours and coaching, so she needs rest. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014are disruptive. She initially asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. \n\nHer response is to push him off when cuddling too much and even a threat, albeit in a joking manner. The next day, she apologizes by kissing him and explaining her need for sleep. He's upset, so there's some emotional impact on his side. \n\nNow, is she wrong for setting boundaries? In a relationship, especially a new one, communication is key. She expressed her needs, and when he didn't comply, she took steps to protect her health and well-being. However, threatening to murder him might be excessive, even if it's said in frustration. But context matters. She's exhausted, and her actions were to preserve her rest. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, especially since she's working long hours. However, the fact that they're in a new relationship might mean that both are still learning each other's boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong for her to prioritize her health? Probably not. People have different needs regarding sleep. If he's being disruptive, setting a boundary is reasonable. However, the way she handled it\u2014threatening violence, even jokingly\u2014might be crossing a line. But in the context of her being extremely tired and stressed, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe user's opinion is that she's in the wrong, but I think it's more balanced. She's justified in needing rest and setting boundaries, but her response could be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, it's a valid reaction. The boyfriend also has a responsibility to be considerate. So, in this case, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
