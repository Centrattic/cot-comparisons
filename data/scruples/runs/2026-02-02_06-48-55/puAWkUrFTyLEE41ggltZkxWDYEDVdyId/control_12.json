Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe woman is 23, has been dating a 26-year-old man for a couple of weeks. The relationship seems positive, with good sex and he's described as sweet. However, after a long day of work and coaching, she's trying to sleep but he's being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, etc. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but continues to disturb her throughout the night. She pushes him off when he cuddles too hard and eventually threatens to murder him if it happens again. In the morning, she tells him she can't do that again but still loves him. He's upset, and she feels bad but justifies it because she's tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She had a valid reason for needing rest due to her work schedule. He was being disruptive despite her initial request. She's communicating her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. However, she ends up threatening him and then telling him she can't sleep with him anymore. The key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nOn one hand, she's taking care of her needs, which is important. On the other hand, her response\u2014threatening to murder him and then ending the shared sleeping arrangement\u2014might be seen as extreme. But considering the context of her exhaustion and his continued disturbances, her actions could be justified. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he didn't realize the extent of the problem, but she's setting a boundary to protect her health.\n\nI think the main issue is whether her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since she communicated her needs after the incident and apologized, it shows she's trying to balance her needs with the relationship. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but she's not wrong for prioritizing her rest. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
