Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 23-year-old woman, who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a couple of weeks. They have good sex and a good relationship, but last night was a problem. She was exhausted from work and soccer coaching, and fell asleep. Her boyfriend was being loud with his phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed, etc. She told him to turn it off, which he did, but continued to disturb her sleep throughout the night. She ended up telling him she might kill him if he woke her again. The next morning, she apologized but said she can't handle that again due to her busy schedule. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, consider the situation. The author was clearly in a state of exhaustion after a long day. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive\u2014loud phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. These are things that can interfere with sleep. The author tried to communicate her needs, and he initially complied but then continued to disturb her. She expressed her frustration, which escalated to a point where she threatened him. The next day, she apologized and explained her need for sleep.\n\nFrom a perspective of communication, she did communicate her needs. He was aware but still continued to disrupt her. The fact that he apologized after she told him to stop the first time, but then the disturbances continued suggests that maybe he didn't take her needs seriously. The author's reaction after multiple disturbances, while extreme in words (\"murder him\"), is understandable given her exhaustion. Her apology in the morning shows she still cares, but she's setting a boundary about her need for rest.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. Even if he was tired, the actions he took (scratching, burping, moving around) are disruptive. The author's actions were a reaction to his repeated failures to respect her need for sleep. Since she communicated her needs and he didn't follow through, her setting a boundary is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
