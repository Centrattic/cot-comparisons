Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman (23F) who's been dating a 26-year-old man (26M) for a couple of weeks. The main issue is that she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because of his nighttime behaviors, which are disturbing her rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her side. She's really tired from work and coaching, and her sleep is being disrupted by his actions\u2014scratching, burping, shaking the bed, etc. She did ask him to turn off his phone, and he apologized but the issues continued. The next morning, she told him she can't handle it anymore, even joking about murder, and he was upset. She feels bad but also needs rest.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was apologetic after the first incident. He might not realize how bad the problem is. He's a new partner, so maybe he's not aware of her needs yet. His reaction to her comments the next morning shows he was hurt, which adds emotional weight.\n\nNow, assessing whether she's wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs after the incident, which is good. She's justified in needing rest, especially with a busy schedule. However, the way she communicated (threatening to murder him) might be harsh, but the context is stress from exhaustion. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive despite her initial request. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe suggesting a trial of sleeping separately temporarily while they adjust. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since her main issue is health and well-being related to sleep, and she communicated her needs, it's more about his behavior than her being wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
