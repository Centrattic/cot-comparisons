Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend after he disturbed her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, and the sex is good. But she had a long, tiring day and went to bed. Her boyfriend was making a lot of noise and disturbing her throughout the night. She told him to stop, and he did, but the disturbances continued. She eventually threatened him, leading to a morning conversation where she said she can't do that again. He was upset, and she feels bad but emphasizes her need for sleep.\n\nNow, considering the context. She's clearly exhausted from work and coaching. Her needs for rest are valid. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014making noise, shaking the bed, etc.\u2014is problematic and affects her well-being. She communicated her needs, and when he didn't adjust, she set boundaries. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her health, especially with a demanding schedule. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt by her ultimatum and her comment about not wanting to sleep together again. Relationships require compromise, and maybe she could have addressed the issue earlier or in a different way. But given the circumstances, her actions seem justified. She's not being inconsiderate; she's standing up for her needs after repeated disturbances. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I should consider if her response was too harsh. She did apologize afterward, kissed him, and said she loves him. She's not dismissing their relationship but setting a boundary for her own health. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She tried to communicate, he tried to adjust but failed. Her final action was a consequence of his continued behavior. It's a valid self-care measure. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he's sensitive, but that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. She had legitimate reasons and communicated her needs. The boyfriend's actions disrupted her sleep, and setting a boundary is reasonable.\n"
