Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The woman worked long hours and was exhausted. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he continued making noises and moving around, causing her to wake up repeatedly. She told him she might hurt him if he did it again. In the morning, she apologized and explained she needs sleep, but he was upset.\n\nSo, the main points are about sleep disturbance and communication. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, especially since he was aware of her tiredness. However, her response of threatening him and leaving might be seen as harsh. But considering her need for rest and the context of a new relationship, maybe she's justified in setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have addressed the issue earlier or tried to find a solution together, like sleeping in separate beds from the start if that's necessary. But given that it was a recent issue and she worked long hours, her reaction might be understandable. \n\nI need to decide if her actions were unreasonable. Threatening physical harm is a red flag, but she was clearly frustrated. The boyfriend crying might indicate he felt rejected. However, her health and well-being are important too. \n\nI think the key here is that both could have handled it better. The boyfriend should have been more considerate, and she could have communicated her needs without the threat. But the main issue is his disruptive behavior. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
