Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman who refuses to sleep with her boyfriend after a night of disturbed sleep due to his behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014noisy phone use, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014interfered with her sleep. She asked him to stop, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up getting very frustrated and told him she can't do that again, which made him cry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether I agree.\n\nFrom the woman's perspective, her need for sleep is valid, especially given her demanding schedule. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and work performance. She's prioritizing her well-being. However, her response was harsh, mentioning wanting to \"murder\" him, which is extreme. But the story also shows she apologized in the morning and expressed love, indicating she cares for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive. Even if he apologized, the repeated disturbances show he might not be considerate of her needs. The key here is communication. She did tell him to stop, but maybe she could have addressed it differently. However, her actions are a reaction to his ongoing behavior despite her requests. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014crying\u2014might suggest he felt rejected, but his actions were the root cause. The woman has the right to set boundaries for her health. While her language was harsh, the underlying reason is valid. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; she's standing up for her needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
