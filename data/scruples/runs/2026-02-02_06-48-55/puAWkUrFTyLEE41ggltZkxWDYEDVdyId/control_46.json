Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he was disruptive during the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman worked long hours and was exhausted. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014was affecting her sleep. She tried to communicate her needs, and he apologized but the behavior continued. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again, which made him emotional.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The woman clearly communicated her needs and explained why she couldn't continue. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive, and she had a valid reason to set a boundary. The fact that she still loved him and expressed it shows she's not being cruel, just prioritizing her health.\n\nThere's no indication that she was unreasonable. She gave him a chance to adjust (he turned off his phone) but the problem persisted. Sleep is crucial, especially with her demanding schedule. Her response, while direct, is a reasonable boundary. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he didn't realize the impact, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to set limits.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her well-being and communicated her needs clearly.\n"
