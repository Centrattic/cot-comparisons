Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (23F) not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend (26M) after a rough night. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The boyfriend was being disruptive: loud noises, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept waking her up. She threatened him in the morning, and now she feels bad but is honest about her needs.\n\nThe main issue is whether she was wrong to express her needs and set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior was clearly affecting her sleep and health, especially after a long workday. People often have different sleep habits, and it's not uncommon for partners to adjust. She communicated her feelings, which is important in relationships. \n\nHe reacted emotionally, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's in the wrong. She's prioritizing her well-being, which is valid. Maybe she could have discussed it more calmly, but threatening murder was a hyperbolic reaction. However, the core issue is her needing space to sleep. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's justified in setting boundaries, especially when her health and work demands are at stake. The boyfriend's actions were problematic, and she's addressing it in a way that shows she still cares but needs her space.\n"
