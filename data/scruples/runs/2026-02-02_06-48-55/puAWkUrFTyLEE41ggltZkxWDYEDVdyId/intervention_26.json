Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is between options A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. They had a good time, but during a night where she was very tired after a long day, her boyfriend disturbed her sleep with various noisy and disruptive behaviors. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She pushed him off when he tried to cuddle, and ultimately threatened to kill him if he disturbed her again. The next morning, she apologized but made it clear she couldn't handle that again.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. They want to know if the author is in the wrong. My task is to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nLet me break it down. The boyfriend's actions: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. These are all things that could disturb someone's sleep. The author was working long hours and coaching, so her need for sleep is understandable. She gave him a chance to stop by asking him to turn off his phone, but the disturbances continued. Her reaction of pushing him off and eventually threatening to murder him is extreme, but given her exhaustion, maybe it's excusable.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, her actions were to protect her own well-being. She communicated her needs, and when they weren't met, she took steps to ensure she could get rest. However, her response was to push him off and make a threatening comment. The key here is whether her actions crossed a line into being unreasonable or hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive. He apologized when told to stop the phone, but continued with other noises. He was trying to cuddle, which she was okay with initially but found painful when he was too rough. His reaction of almost crying in the morning might indicate that he felt hurt by her response. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, and while her response was strong (especially the murder threat), it's in the context of extreme fatigue. However, threatening someone, even in frustration, is not acceptable. But maybe the question is whether she's in the wrong for setting boundaries or for the way she communicated them. \n\nThe author's main issue is the boyfriend's disruptive behavior. She has a legitimate need for rest, and she's in a committed relationship where both partners should respect each other's needs. However, threatening violence, even as a joke, is not something to be taken lightly. But considering the context of exhaustion and stress, maybe it's understandable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend should have been more considerate from the start. He was aware of her tiredness, yet continued with behaviors that would disturb her sleep. So perhaps the fault lies more with him. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If her actions were a reasonable reaction to his continued disregard for her sleep after she asked him to stop, then she's not in the wrong. But if her threats and pushing him off were excessive, then she might be. \n\nIn many relationships, it's normal to set boundaries. However, the way she communicated it was harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe it's excusable. The key factors are his repeated disturbances and her exhaustion. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's protecting her own health, and his behavior was the main issue. However, the threatening comment could be a point against her. \n\nBut in the context of the story, the phrase \"I\u2019d murder him\" is likely an extreme expression of frustration rather than a literal threat. She also apologized the next day. So maybe the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because her needs were valid and she communicated them, even if her response was strong. The boyfriend's behavior was the primary problem.\n"
