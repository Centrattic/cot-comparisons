Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author (23F) is in a new relationship with a guy (26M). They're both dating a few weeks, and the sex is good. But last night, the guy was being loud with his phone, scratching, burping, etc., which kept her awake. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he continued to disturb her throughout the night. She was very tired from work and coaching. In the morning, she kissed him but said she can't do that again because she needs sleep. He almost cried, but she feels she's not at fault.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the scenario. The guy's behavior was disruptive: loud phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. The author tried to communicate her needs by asking him to turn off the phone. He complied but other actions (scratching, etc.) continued to disturb her. She was exhausted. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to address the issue and was direct. The guy's response was to be sorry but the behavior continued. The author then set a boundary that they can't sleep together again. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, communication is crucial. The author had a legitimate need for rest. The guy's actions were affecting her well-being. While it's important to approach conflicts with empathy, in this case, the author protected her own needs. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to set that boundary. Since she communicated her needs and tried to resolve it, and the guy didn't adjust his behavior, her decision to not sleep together again seems reasonable. He might need to work on his habits, but she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her health. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
