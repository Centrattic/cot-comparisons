Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because he's disrupting her sleep with his actions. \n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman has been working long hours and is exhausted. Her boyfriend's behaviors\u2014like loud noises, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014keep waking her up. She tried to communicate her needs, and even though he apologized, the disruptions continued. She ended up telling him that she can't handle it again and that she needs her sleep. He was upset, but she's standing by her decision.\n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected. The woman is ending the physical relationship, which can be a big deal. But is she in the wrong here? Well, communication is key in relationships. She did ask him to stop, and he tried but the problem persisted. Her job and health are important; she needs rest. It's her right to set boundaries to take care of herself.\n\nBut could there be a middle ground? Maybe they could have tried sleeping in separate rooms temporarily or found other solutions. However, the author's main point is that she needs her sleep and can't continue like this. The question is whether her decision is unreasonable. \n\nGiven that she communicated her needs and the situation isn't improving, she's justified in setting that boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't make her wrong. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
