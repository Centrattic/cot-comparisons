Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, has been dating a 26-year-old guy for a couple of weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but she's really tired after a long day and he's being disruptive in bed. She tells him to stop, he apologizes, but it keeps happening. She ends up being really frustrated and tells him she can't sleep with him anymore, even joking about murder. In the morning, she feels bad but he almost cries.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly exhausted from work and coaching. She asked him to stop the disruptive behaviors, he complied for a bit but then continued. She's stressed about her schedule and needs rest. On the other hand, the boyfriend is being described as loud, shaking the bed, and being physically intrusive. He's responding by trying to cuddle too hard, which wakes her up again. \n\nBut the key point is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her needs clearly and he didn't respect them despite her request, then she's justified in setting boundaries. However, maybe she could have handled it differently? Like, maybe she should have tried to talk to him more calmly instead of making a joke about murder. But the main issue is about respecting her need for sleep. \n\nWait, the question is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Is that wrong? She had a valid reason\u2014she's exhausted and he's not respecting her need for rest. She did communicate her needs, and he didn't adjust. So she's taking action to protect her well-being. On the other hand, he's upset and crying. Maybe there's a communication gap. But given the circumstances, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her health and setting boundaries. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
