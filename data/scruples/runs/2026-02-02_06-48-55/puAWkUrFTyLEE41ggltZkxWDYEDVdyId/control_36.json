Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman (23F) has been dating a guy (26M) for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex. But one night, he's very disruptive\u2014watching videos, making noise, scratching, burping, etc., even after she asks him to stop. She gets extremely frustrated, tells him she'd murder him if he does it again. The next morning, she tells him she can't sleep together again because of her busy schedule and need for sleep. He's upset, almost cries, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nSo, the key points here are her need for rest due to her work and coaching schedule, and his inability to adjust his behavior to accommodate that need. She communicated her needs clearly, even though it hurt his feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFrom what I read, she tried to be polite at first, asking him to turn off his phone. When he didn't stop, she was honest about her exhaustion and set a boundary. He's a sweet guy, but maybe not considering her needs. She's prioritizing her health and work schedule, which is valid. The fact that he reacted emotionally doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong; it shows he's taking it personally, but her right to set boundaries remains. \n\nIs there anything else? Maybe the duration of the relationship\u2014only a few weeks. But even in new relationships, people have the right to express their needs. She's being honest about her limits, which is important for a healthy relationship. He might need to adapt his behavior or they might need to find a compromise, like sleeping in separate rooms. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong for setting a boundary to protect her well-being and schedule.\n"
