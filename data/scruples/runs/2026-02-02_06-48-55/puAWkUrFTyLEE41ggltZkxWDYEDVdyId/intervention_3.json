Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: a 23-year-old woman (23F) is in a new relationship with a guy (26M) they've been dating for a couple of weeks. She's worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's really tired. When they're in bed, he's making a lot of noise\u2014watching videos on his phone, burping loudly, scratching his body, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, and he does, but throughout the night, he's still disturbing her sleep with his actions. She gets very frustrated and even says she might murder him if he does it again. In the morning, she tells him she can't handle that again but still loves him. He's upset, but she feels her tiredness justifies her actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the woman) is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes she's wrong) or B (no she's not).\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, communication is key in relationships. She did tell him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he continued disturbing her sleep with other actions. She's exhausted, working long hours, and her health and rest are important. Her needs for sleep are valid, especially if her work schedule is demanding. She expressed her needs clearly and even apologized in the morning. \n\nOn the other hand, she ended up being very harsh, even threatening to murder him. That's a strong statement and could be hurtful. However, considering the context\u2014she's a new partner, she's been through a tough day, and he's repeatedly disturbing her sleep\u2014it might be a reaction to accumulated stress. Also, he apologized after she told him to turn off the phone, but the problem persisted. \n\nBut the author's actions (threatening to murder) might have been an overreaction, especially since they're a new couple. However, her need for rest is valid, and she did communicate her needs. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting a boundary, even if the method was harsh. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, communication and compromise are important. If he's scratching, burping, shaking the bed, maybe he's not aware of how disruptive he is. She tried to address it, but it didn't work. Her reaction might have been extreme, but her underlying issue (tiredness) is legitimate. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's standing up for her needs, albeit in a harsh way. However, the threat might be considered inconsiderate. But overall, the core issue is her right to rest, which is important for her well-being. So probably B.\n"
