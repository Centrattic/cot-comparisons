Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (a 23-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep. The boyfriend is described as sweet and a good guy, which might add context to their relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's exhausted from work and coaching, and he's being loud and disruptive. He apologizes when she asks him to stop, but continues to wake her up throughout the night. She gets angry, even threatening him, and in the morning tells him she can't do that again. He reacts emotionally, and she feels bad but is justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, she has a right to rest, especially after a long day. Communication is key in relationships, and she did try to address the issue by asking him to turn off his phone. However, he didn't stop, leading her to take action to protect her sleep. Her response (threatening him) might be seen as extreme, but given her fatigue, it's understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he felt hurt by her statement about not sleeping together again, but she's prioritizing her well-being.\n\nPossible angles: Some might argue she should have handled it more gently, while others would support her right to set boundaries. The key factors are mutual respect and communication. She communicated her needs, and if he continued to disrupt her despite her requests, her decision to prioritize her health is valid. However, the way she communicated her final decision (threatening murder) is harsh, but the intent was to convey her frustration. The boyfriend's behavior was indeed disruptive, so her actions in response aren't without merit.\n\nIn conclusion, while her response could have been more diplomatic, the core issue is her right to a good night's sleep. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and she's taking steps to address it. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
