Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disrupted her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman had a long day, worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours. She's exhausted and needs sleep. Her boyfriend's behavior included loud noises, scratching, burping, and cuddling too hard, which kept waking her up. She asked him to stop, and he apologized, but the disturbances continued. She even threatened to murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she felt justified because she was tired.\n\nNow, the key points here: the woman's need for rest is valid, especially after a long day. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive and he didn't stop despite being asked. The woman communicated her needs clearly, even if it was bluntly. The fact that he cried might make people think she was too harsh, but her main point was about her well-being. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she did confront him and set a boundary. She's prioritizing her health and sleep, which is important. He might need to adjust his behavior, but she's not wrong for stating her needs. The answer would likely be B (No), because she's justified in protecting her rest, even if the communication style was direct. The boyfriend's reaction is his issue, not her being in the wrong.\n"
