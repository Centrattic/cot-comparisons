Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old guy for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, great sex, but last night she was really tired after a long work and coaching shift. She asked him to turn off his phone and let her sleep, and he did, but all night she kept waking up because he was scratching, burping, shaking the bed, etc. She told him she'd murder him at 5 am, and in the morning, she said she can't do that again but still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but emphasizes she's tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman was exhausted and needed rest. She communicated her need to her boyfriend, who initially tried to comply by turning off his phone. But he continued to make noises and movements that disrupted her sleep. She tried to manage it by pushing him off when he cuddled too hard, but eventually had to set a boundary. Her reaction (threatening to murder him if he woke her again) was extreme, but in the morning, she apologized and explained the reason. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) suggests he was hurt by her words, but the woman's main issue was her need for sleep due to her demanding schedule.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is it wrong for her to set boundaries? She's allowed to prioritize her health and well-being. The boyfriend might need to adjust his habits to accommodate her needs. However, her use of a violent threat might be seen as excessive, even if she felt that way. But in the morning, she clarified her position, so perhaps it's about how she communicated the boundary. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did express her need, and the boyfriend probably needs to be more considerate. But the threat of murder is a strong statement. However, the context is that she was extremely tired and stressed. The question is whether the author overstepped by threatening him, even if it was in a moment of frustration. But the next day, she explained that she still loved him and couldn't do that again, which shows she made amends. \n\nThe wrong part could be the threat, but the right part is asserting her need for sleep. The answer might depend on whether the threat is considered the wrong action. Alternatively, the boyfriend's behavior in bed is also problematic. So maybe the woman was justified in setting a boundary, even if her wording was harsh. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's the case. The main issue is that she told him she'd murder him, which is extreme. However, context matters. If the boyfriend is aware of her schedule and has been a good partner otherwise, maybe he should adapt. But the threat itself is a red flag regardless of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend's habits are causing her to be sleep-deprived and affecting her health, then she's in the right to address it. The way she communicated it was harsh, but maybe the underlying need is valid. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs, even if the method was a bit extreme. But some might argue that the threat was wrong regardless of the reason. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is the one in the wrong for disturbing her sleep despite her request. So the woman's reaction, while extreme, is a result of legitimate frustration. Therefore, she's not entirely at fault. \n\nI think the key here is that she communicated her need and was firm, but the use of a violent threat is problematic. However, in the morning she clarified and apologized. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on the threat, then maybe A. But if the focus is on her right to demand rest, then B. \n\nBut the main question is about being in the wrong. Since she did set a boundary and later explained it, and the boyfriend's repeated disturbances are on him, the author's actions, while harsh, are understandable under the circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
