Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman telling her 26-year-old boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore after a bad night. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman worked a 9-hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, so she was very tired. When she tried to sleep, her boyfriend was making a lot of noise\u2014watching videos, loud burps, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up being so frustrated that she threatened to murder him if he did it again. The next morning, she told him she couldn't do that again but still loved him. The boyfriend almost cried, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She's in a new relationship (a few weeks), and communication is key. She expressed her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. She worked hard and needed rest, which is valid. Her boyfriend, while apologizing, didn't stop the behaviors that kept her awake. She's taking steps to protect her own well-being by choosing not to sleep in the same bed, which shows she's setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he felt hurt. But the woman's actions are a response to ongoing issues that affect her health and schedule. She's being honest about her needs. The key points are: she communicated her needs, he didn't address them adequately despite her requests, and she's making a choice to prioritize her health. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged based on their actions and communication. Since she's setting boundaries and he's not respecting her sleep (a basic need), she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior if he wants the relationship to work. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
