Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let's look at the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: he's watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. These are disruptive and have made her sleep poor. She tried to communicate her needs by asking him to turn off his phone, but he didn't stop the other behaviors. She ends up exhausted and tells him she can't do that again.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's worked hard and needs rest. Her job and coaching schedule are demanding. She's been clear about her needs, but he's not respecting them. The question is whether her decision to not sleep with him is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is hurt and almost cries, showing emotional distress. But the author's main issue is lack of sleep due to his behaviors. She's communicated her needs, and if he can't adjust, maybe it's reasonable for her to set that boundary. \n\nI think the key points are communication and mutual respect. She tried to address the problem, but he didn't adapt. Her health and well-being, especially with her busy schedule, are important. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should give him more chances to change. However, given the context of repeated disruptions and her clear communication, her stance seems justified. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
