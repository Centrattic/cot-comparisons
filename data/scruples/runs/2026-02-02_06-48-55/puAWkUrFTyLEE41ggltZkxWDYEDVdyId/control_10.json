Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is in a new relationship with a guy she just started dating. They had sex, but she was exhausted after a long day of work and coaching. Her boyfriend was being disruptive in bed at night with various noises and movements, even after she asked him to be quiet. She ended up telling him she can't sleep with him again because she needs her rest. He was upset, but she still loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is whether her decision to not sleep in the same bed again is justified. Let's break it down. She's been working a lot and needs rest, which is valid. She communicated her needs, even after he apologized, but the disruptions continued. She tried to be polite but finally set a boundary. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior was clearly problematic, but perhaps he didn't realize the extent of his actions. However, she did mention that he was sweet and apologized, which might mean he's not intentionally trying to be disruptive.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. In this context, the author's actions are about setting boundaries for her well-being. Sleep is crucial, and if someone can't respect that even after being told, then the boundary is necessary. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt rejected, but the author's need for sleep takes precedence. The fact that she's in a new relationship could mean she's still figuring out boundaries, but her actions are about self-care. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be that maybe she could have handled it differently, like discussing it in the morning instead of pushing him off or making threats. But the key here is that she did talk to him in the morning and explained her reasons. The threat of \"murder\" was probably an exaggeration out of frustration. Also, considering her job and schedule, her health is important. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner's habits are affecting the other's health, that's a legitimate concern. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has medical issues causing the scratching or coughing. But the story doesn't mention that, so it's an assumption. If he had a condition, he might have mentioned it. The author did give him a chance to adjust but couldn't find a solution. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her needs. She communicated clearly and set a boundary, which is healthy in any relationship. The answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
