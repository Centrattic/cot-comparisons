Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman (23F) is telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The context is that he was being disruptive all night\u2014talking loud, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up being so tired that she threatened him, and in the morning she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule. The boyfriend was upset about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. On the woman's side, she's clearly exhausted from work and coaching. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't stop. She felt she had to set a boundary by telling him she can't sleep with him. On the man's side, he apologized and stopped the phone, but maybe the other behaviors were beyond his control, like scratching or being a heavy sleeper. Maybe he's not aware of how disruptive he is. \n\nBut the key here is that she tried to ask him to stop, and even after that, it continued. She's justified in needing rest. Her job and schedule are important, and lack of sleep affects her. The boyfriend's reaction of crying shows he's hurt, but that doesn't mean her being honest is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She communicated her needs, and he didn't adjust. She's not the one being inconsiderate here. She's setting boundaries to maintain her health. The boyfriend might need to address his behaviors, but the woman is not wrong for stating her needs. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. She's taking care of her well-being, which is important. The boyfriend should adapt, but she's justified in her actions.\n"
