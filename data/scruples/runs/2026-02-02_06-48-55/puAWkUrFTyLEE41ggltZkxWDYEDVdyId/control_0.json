Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore after a night of disturbances.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's very tired. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc.\u2014are clearly disruptive. She asked him to turn off his phone, and he did, but the disturbances continued. She got so frustrated she told him she can't do it again, even threatening to murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she still loves him but can't handle the sleep issues.\n\nThe key points here are her need for sleep due to her busy schedule and the boyfriend's inability to quiet down despite her request. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting this boundary. From a general perspective, respecting someone's need for rest is important, especially if they're overworked. It's reasonable to ask a partner to adjust their behavior to ensure both get enough sleep. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, so her response is about self-care.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she could have tried other solutions first, like separate sleeping arrangements earlier, or maybe the boyfriend's habits are a sign of something else (like health issues). But given the information, the boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her request, and she's justified in prioritizing her sleep. The fact that she apologized and expressed love in the morning shows she's not being harsh without reason.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's setting a boundary to protect her well-being, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
