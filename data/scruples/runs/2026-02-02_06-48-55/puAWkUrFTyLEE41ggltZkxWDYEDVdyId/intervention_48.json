Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who doesn't want to sleep in the same bed as her new boyfriend because he's disrupting her sleep with his habits. She's been working long hours and needs rest, but she's worried about hurting his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is explaining that her boyfriend's behaviors\u2014like watching videos loudly, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed\u2014are keeping her awake. She tried to address it, but he kept waking her up. She eventually told him she can't continue sleeping with him, leading to his emotional reaction.\n\nOn one hand, her need for sleep is valid, especially with her demanding schedule. Everyone has different sleep needs and sensitivities. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries to protect her health and well-being. She did communicate her needs, which is important in any relationship. If the problem persists despite her requests, she's within her rights to seek a solution, even if it means sleeping separately for now.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction shows that he might be feeling rejected or hurt. It's also important to consider his feelings, but the author isn't dismissing his feelings entirely\u2014she mentions feeling bad and kissing him in the morning. The key here is whether her actions were inconsiderate. She's being honest about her needs and not forcing him out of the relationship. Sleeping separately isn't inherently wrong if it's necessary for her well-being, especially in the early stages of a relationship where adjusting to each other's habits is a learning process.\n\nAnother angle is that in a new relationship, there's a period where both partners adjust to each other's routines and quirks. However, if those quirks are significantly affecting her health, it's reasonable to address it. The boyfriend might need to work on his habits, but if that's not possible immediately, sleeping apart could be a temporary solution. She's not saying it's permanent, just that she needs space right now.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her health and communicating her needs. Relationships require compromise, and she's making a choice that's necessary for her. The boyfriend might need to reflect on his behaviors, but the author isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
