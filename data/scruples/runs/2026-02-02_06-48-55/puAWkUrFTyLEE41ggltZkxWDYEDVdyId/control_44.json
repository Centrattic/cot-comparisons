Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because he's disrupting her sleep with his behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman worked a long day and was exhausted. Her boyfriend was making noises, shaking the bed, etc., which kept her up all night. She told him to stop, he tried but couldn't, leading her to say she can't sleep with him again. The question is if she's wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She expressed her needs clearly, and he was apologetic but couldn't control his actions. The woman prioritizes her health and well-being by getting enough rest, which is important, especially with a demanding schedule. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel rejected or hurt, but her actions are justified if his behavior consistently disrupts her sleep. \n\nThe key points here are her right to rest and the boyfriend's inability to adjust. Since she's communicated her needs and he's tried but still can't meet them, her decision isn't unreasonable. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance: maybe she could have found another solution, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. But since she did communicate and he was apologetic but couldn't help, her action is justified. So the answer should be B.\n"
