Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new relationship where the boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing the author's sleep. She worked long hours and is exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend was making loud noises, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed. The author asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She tried to communicate her needs, even to the point of threatening to \"murder him\" if he woke her again. In the morning, she apologized but still felt the need to set boundaries about not sleeping together.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She's working hard, has a demanding schedule, and her health and well-being depend on sleep. Her communication seems direct but understandable given her exhaustion. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive, and she's trying to set boundaries to protect her needs. However, the threat of murder is extreme, but it's in a moment of frustration. Also, in the morning, she reassures him she still loves him, which shows she's not being malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected by her refusal to sleep together, especially in a new relationship. But the author's main issue is her need for rest. It's reasonable to prioritize one's health. The boyfriend's behaviors are objectively disruptive, so her response is about self-care.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on communication and respect. The author communicated her needs clearly, and her actions are to protect her well-being. The boyfriend's actions are the initial problem. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). However, the threat might be a point against her, but in context, it's hyperbolic due to exhaustion. The key is that she's setting boundaries for valid reasons.\n"
