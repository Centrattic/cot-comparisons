Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend not to sleep in the same bed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is 23F, dating a 26M guy for a couple of weeks. They have a good relationship, sex is good. But the author had a long, tiring day and was trying to sleep. The boyfriend was being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asked him to turn off his phone, he apologized and did so, but the disturbances continued all night. She even threatened him with violence multiple times. In the morning, she told him she couldn't do that again, leading him to almost cry, and she feels bad but also needs rest.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, she's clearly exhausted and had a legitimate reason to need rest. She communicated her needs, which he didn't fully respect even after apologizing. Her actions of pushing him off and threatening violence (though not actual harm) might be seen as overreacting, especially in a new relationship. However, her need for sleep is valid, and she made that clear. \n\nOn the other hand, her response might have been harsh. Threatening murder is extreme, even if in frustration. Also, in a new relationship, communication styles matter. Maybe she could have addressed it differently, like suggesting separate beds if the problem persists. But given the circumstances, she might just be setting boundaries for her own well-being. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She did communicate her needs, but perhaps her reaction was too intense. However, given how tired she was, it's understandable. The boyfriend's behavior was indeed disruptive, so there's a balance between self-care and relationship dynamics. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she had a valid need for sleep and communicated that. However, her method of communication was harsh. But since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether her actions were justified. She's setting boundaries, which is okay, but the way she expressed it might be problematic. However, in the context of exhaustion and a new relationship, maybe it's more about both sides needing to adjust. But the question is about her being in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive, so she's not wrong for wanting her space. So answer B.\n"
