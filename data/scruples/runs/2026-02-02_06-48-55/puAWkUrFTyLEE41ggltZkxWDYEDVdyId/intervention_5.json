Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. After a long day of work and coaching, she's really tired and wants to sleep. Her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and disturbances during the night, like watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She tells him to stop, he apologizes and turns off his phone, but he keeps disturbing her. The next morning, she tells him she can't sleep like that again and he almost cried. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author had a long day and needed rest. Her partner's actions were disruptive and she tried to address it. He did apologize, but the problem persisted. She communicated her needs clearly the next day. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected by her statement, especially since they're in a new relationship and she's turning down physical intimacy. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate her needs, and it's her right to ask for a good night's sleep. Her partner might need to adjust his habits, especially when she's clearly exhausted. The fact that she still loves him and is willing to be in the relationship despite setting boundaries suggests she's not being unreasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of almost crying could indicate that he might be sensitive about being asked to sleep separately, which is a valid emotional response, but the author's need for sleep is also valid. It's possible they can find a compromise, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her health and well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
