Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author (23F) is in a new relationship with a guy (26M). They've been dating a couple of weeks, and the sex is good. But last night was rough for her. She had a long day with work and coaching, and when she tried to sleep, he was being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, etc. She asked him to turn off his phone, he did, but still kept waking her up all night. She ended up threatening him and in the morning told him she can't do that again because she needs her sleep. He was upset, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn her side: She's exhausted from her schedule. She communicated her needs, first by asking him to turn off the phone, then by setting a boundary in the morning. Her health and well-being are important; sleep is crucial, especially if she's working long hours. She's being honest about her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. Plus, she still loves him and apologized, showing she's not being cruel without reason.\n\nOn his side: He tried to apologize and cuddle, which is normal behavior. Maybe he didn't realize how disruptive his actions were. However, after she asked him to stop, he still continued, leading to her frustration. He was upset, which is understandable if he felt rejected, but his actions were the initial problem.\n\nRelationships require communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs clearly, and he didn't adjust enough. Her decision to not sleep in the same bed is about her need for rest, which is valid. While it's early in the relationship, setting boundaries is important. She's not being cruel, just prioritizing her health.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's standing up for her needs, which is necessary. The boyfriend should have been more considerate, but the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. Answer B.\n"
