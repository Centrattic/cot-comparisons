Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because he's keeping her up with his behaviors. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014like loud noises, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed\u2014are clearly disturbing her sleep. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that didn't work, she set a boundary. She even apologized and said she still loves him. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was apologetic when she first complained. But the problem continued, leading her to feel she had no choice. The key here is whether her actions were justified. She's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is important. Setting boundaries in a relationship is normal, especially when one's needs aren't being met. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014almost crying\u2014might suggest he felt hurt, but the woman's need for rest seems valid. It's possible that the issue isn't just about the immediate actions but also about ongoing communication. However, she did try to address it, and when that failed, she took action. \n\nI think the main point is that she's advocating for her own well-being. Unless there's a cultural or personal expectation that sleeping separately is taboo, which isn't indicated here, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
