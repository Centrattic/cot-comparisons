Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbing her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman worked a long day and was very tired. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, etc.\u2014disturbed her sleep. She asked him to stop, he tried to comply, but the disturbances continued. She ended up being very frustrated and told him she can't do that again, leading to him almost crying. The user thinks the author is wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate.\n\nFrom the woman's perspective, her need for rest is valid, especially after a long workday. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her requests. She communicated her needs and set a boundary, which is reasonable. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend might need to modify his behavior, but the woman has the right to her sleep and comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014starting to cry\u2014might indicate he felt rejected or hurt. However, the woman's decision is about her well-being. It's possible he needs to reflect on his behavior, but she's not in the wrong for asserting her needs. The question is whether she's at fault for setting this boundary. Since she communicated clearly and he didn't adjust his actions, her decision to sleep separately isn't unreasonable. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
