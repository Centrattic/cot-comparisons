Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe situation is that she's been dating him for a few weeks, things are good, but last night was tough. She had a long day, worked 9 hours and coached soccer. In bed, he's doing things like watching videos out loud, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but still had trouble sleeping because of his movements and sounds. She ended up pushing him off when he cuddled too hard. The next morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she felt justified because she was tired.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong for her to set this boundary. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she had a valid reason for needing rest, especially after such a long day. Communicating her needs is important for her well-being. Also, she did apologize and express her love, so she's not being cruel. On the other hand, maybe she could have tried to address the problem earlier or found a compromise, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. But given the context\u2014only a few weeks into the relationship and the immediate need for rest\u2014it seems reasonable for her to prioritize her health. The boyfriend's reaction is also a point; he was crying, but that's his emotional response, not necessarily her fault. She didn't make a big deal out of it, just stated her needs. So, probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. People have different sleep needs and boundaries, and it's okay to set them, especially when health and job are involved.\n"
