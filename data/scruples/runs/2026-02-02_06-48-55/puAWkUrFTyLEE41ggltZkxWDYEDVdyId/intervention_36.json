Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks and had a rough night where he kept disturbing her sleep with various noises and movements. She told him she couldn't sleep in the same bed again because she needs rest. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted. Her partner's behaviors\u2014like loud noises, scratching, and shaking the bed\u2014clearly disrupted her sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone and he did, but the disturbances continued. She even got to the point of threatening violence if he woke her again. In the morning, she explained she needed sleep but still loved him. He was upset, but she felt justified because she's tired.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel hurt that she's separating from him, especially after only a few weeks. He apologized when she asked him to turn off his phone, so maybe he tried to adjust. But the problem persisted, and she had valid reasons for needing rest. Her job and responsibilities are demanding. \n\nI need to think about what's reasonable. It's understandable for her to prioritize her health and need for sleep, especially given her work schedule. The guy's behaviors were problematic and affected her well-being. While it's early in the relationship, communication about needs is important. She expressed her needs clearly and tried to be kind, even though he was upset. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The guy's actions disrupted her sleep, and she had a legitimate reason to set a boundary. The fact that she still loves him and kissed him in the morning shows she's not being cruel without cause. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
