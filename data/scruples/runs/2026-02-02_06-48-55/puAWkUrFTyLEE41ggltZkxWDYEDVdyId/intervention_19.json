Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she's in a new relationship with her boyfriend, they've been dating a couple of weeks. She's worked hard, is exhausted, and can't sleep because he's making a lot of noise and being disruptive. She tells him to stop, he apologizes, but it keeps happening. She ends up being really frustrated and even threatens him, then in the morning tells him she can't do that again. He gets upset, but she still feels her needs are more important.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. She's clearly in a state of being very tired, which is a valid reason for needing rest. Her job and coaching take up a lot of time and energy, so getting enough sleep is crucial for her well-being. When someone is that tired, not getting sleep can be really stressful and affect their mood and health. So from her perspective, she's trying to communicate her needs, even if it came out harshly.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, etc.\u2014are disturbing her sleep. He might not realize how disruptive his actions are, especially in a new relationship where they're still learning each other's boundaries. But she did tell him to stop and he tried to comply, though it didn't last. However, when she pushes him off and threatens him, that's pretty harsh. Her response of saying she might murder him is extreme, which could be hurtful to him.\n\nBut considering the context, she's exhausted and in a new relationship. Maybe she's not used to sharing a bed yet, especially with someone who hasn't adjusted to her needs. It's also possible that she's being honest about her needs, which is important in a relationship. The key here is whether she overstepped by being aggressive in her communication. However, since she apologized the next day and reassured him she still loves him, it shows she's aware of her harshness but prioritizes her rest.\n\nI think the main issue is whether her actions were justified given her state. She's in a new relationship, and communication is key. She did try to address the problem, but perhaps there was a better way. But given the circumstances, she's trying to protect her health and well-being. The boyfriend's reaction might be a sign that he needs to adjust his behavior, but she's also within her rights to set boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
