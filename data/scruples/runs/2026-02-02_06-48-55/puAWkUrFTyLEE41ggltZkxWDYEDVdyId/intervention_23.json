Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend's behaviors\u2014like loud phone use, scratching, burping, etc.\u2014are keeping her up. She told him to stop, he apologized but it continued. She ended up threatening him and then, in the morning, said she can't do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's been working hard, very tired, and her sleep is being disrupted. Sleep is important for health and well-being. The boyfriend's actions are clearly disturbing her rest, even after she asked him to stop. That seems like a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the key point is her decision not to sleep in the same bed. Is that the right call? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. She did communicate her discomfort and he tried to apologize. But his actions kept happening, leading to her frustration. Her response was to tell him she can't continue sleeping with him, which might seem abrupt, but given her exhaustion, maybe understandable.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend's behavior is habitual and not improving despite her requests, she's justified in seeking a solution. Sleeping separately could be a temporary or long-term fix. However, some might argue that she should have discussed it more or tried to find a compromise first. But given the circumstances described, where her needs for sleep are being compromised repeatedly, her action might be a reasonable boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate he felt hurt or rejected. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. She's prioritizing her health. Relationships require mutual adjustment. If he's willing to change his habits, maybe there's a way to work it out. But if not, her decision to sleep separately is about her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her needs, which is important. The answer should be B.\n"
