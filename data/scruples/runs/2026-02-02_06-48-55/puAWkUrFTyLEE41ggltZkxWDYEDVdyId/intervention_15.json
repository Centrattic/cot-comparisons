Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who doesn't want to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend because he's disrupting her sleep. She's worked hard, and he's being noisy and physically disruptive. She told him to stop, he apologized but kept doing it. Then she threatened him and in the morning told him she can't do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. They've only been dating a few weeks. She's very tired and needs her sleep because of her work and coaching. He's being loud and causing her to wake up. She tried to communicate her needs, but he didn't stop. Then she set a boundary, even if it was harsh. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her needs. It's reasonable to ask a partner to be considerate of sleep, especially after a long day. He didn't really change his behavior after she asked, which contributed to her frustration. Her response was strong, but maybe justified given how tired she is. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she didn't give him enough time to adjust or communicate her needs more gently. But the situation seems to be that he wasn't respecting her request. She's not wrong for needing her sleep and setting boundaries. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was the issue here.\n"
