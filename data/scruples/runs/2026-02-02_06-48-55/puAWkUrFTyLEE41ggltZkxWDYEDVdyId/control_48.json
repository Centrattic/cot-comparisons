Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's disrupting her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. She's been working long hours and coaching, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's behaviors\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, bed shaking\u2014are keeping her up all night. She asked him to stop, he tried to apologize, but the disturbances continued. She ends up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and later tells him she can't do that again, which makes him cry. She feels bad but is also tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On her side, she's being honest about her needs. Sleep is crucial, especially after a long workday. She communicated her request, and he didn't fully comply. Her reaction, while strong (\"murder him\"), is in a moment of desperation. Her follow-up in the morning is respectful, acknowledging her feelings and his. She's prioritizing her health and schedule, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend is also trying to be affectionate (cuddling), which she's not in the mood for. But his actions were disruptive. Maybe he didn't realize the extent of the problem, or perhaps he's unaware of how his behaviors affect her. However, she did communicate her needs, and he didn't adjust sufficiently. The fact that he cried suggests he felt hurt, but that doesn't necessarily mean her actions were wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is about mutual respect and communication. She has a right to a good night's sleep, and he has a right to feel loved and physically close. The problem is that his actions were interfering with her basic need for rest. She's not being cruel; she's setting a boundary for her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction might be emotional, but that doesn't override her need for sleep. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, partners need to find a balance. The author made a choice to prioritize her health, which is valid. She could have discussed it more calmly, but her actions were in response to ongoing issues. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate of her needs, but she's not in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
