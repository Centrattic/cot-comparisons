Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong. The situation is that a 23-year-old woman is in a new relationship with a 26-year-old guy. She's been working a lot and is exhausted. Last night, her boyfriend's behaviors\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, bed shaking\u2014kept her up all night. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. Eventually, she threatened to kill him if he woke her again. In the morning, she apologized, saying she can't handle that again due to her schedule, but he cried, and she feels bad.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, the key points here are about shared sleeping space and communication. The woman is clearly exhausted and her job requires her to be well-rested. The boyfriend's behaviors are disruptive and persistent despite her initial request. The fact that he apologized after the first time but continued suggests that he might not be fully aware of the impact of his actions or didn't take her request seriously enough.\n\nOn the other hand, she did confront him initially, and later, after multiple wake-ups, she threatened violence. That's a strong reaction, which might be over the top even if he was annoying. But considering her state of extreme tiredness and the fact that she communicated her needs clearly, maybe her reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The boyfriend's possible sensitivity to the threat could be a red flag if he can't handle constructive criticism, but maybe he was just upset.\n\nThe main issue is whether her actions were in the wrong. She set a boundary that she needed sleep, which is valid. If the boyfriend can't respect that, maybe the problem is on his side. However, threatening violence, even in jest, is inappropriate regardless of the situation. So while her need for rest is valid, her reaction might have been too harsh. But the question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's justified because she communicated her needs, and the boyfriend was not respecting them. The threat was a reaction to being sleep-deprived, which is a valid reason. So depending on perspective, she might not be wrong. But threatening someone with murder, even in frustration, is not acceptable. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because of the violent threat. However, if the context is that she's in a new relationship and just setting boundaries, maybe it's B (not wrong). \n\nHmm. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks at both sides. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive and he might not have been considerate enough, but she also overreacted with the murder threat. So perhaps she's not in the wrong entirely, but there's a nuance. The answer might depend on whether the threat is the main issue. Since the user thinks she's wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider the context. If someone is sleep-deprived and clearly communicated their needs, and the other party isn't respecting them, the onus is on the other person. The violent threat is a problem, but maybe it's not the wrongdoer in the situation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The threat is a red flag, but given the circumstances, maybe she's justified in her frustration. Alternatively, the threat is why she's in the wrong. It's tricky. But in the end, if the boyfriend was being disrespectful and she's setting boundaries, she's not wrong. The threat is a separate issue, but the main question is about sleeping arrangements. So maybe answer B.\n"
