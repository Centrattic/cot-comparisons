Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about her not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her new boyfriend because of his disruptive behavior during the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old guy for a few weeks. They have good chemistry, but last night was a problem. She worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she was really tired. Her boyfriend was being loud and disruptive with his phone, scratching, burping, etc. She asked him to turn it off, and he did, but she kept waking up. She ended up telling him she can't handle it again and now she's avoiding sleeping in the same bed. He's upset, but she feels she needs sleep.\n\nSo, the main points are her need for rest and his behavior affecting that. She's in a new relationship, so maybe they haven't established sleeping habits yet. She's been clear about her needs, but he might not have realized how disruptive he was. However, she's now choosing to sleep separately, which might be her right to prioritize her health. But she's been direct about her needs, so if he's still causing issues, maybe she's justified. On the other hand, maybe she could have found a compromise, like using a white noise machine or earplugs instead of separating. But given how tired she was and the severity of the disruptions, her decision might be reasonable. \n\nI think she's not entirely in the wrong because she's communicated her needs and the situation was extreme. He might need to adjust his behavior, but she's taking steps to take care of herself. So the answer is B, No.\n"
