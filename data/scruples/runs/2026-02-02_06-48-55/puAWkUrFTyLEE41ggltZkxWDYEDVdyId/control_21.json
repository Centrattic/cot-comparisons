Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe woman is 23, dating a 26-year-old guy for a few weeks. Their relationship is going well, sex is good. Last night, after a long day of work and coaching, she's really tired. Her boyfriend is being disruptive in bed\u2014watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but he continues to disturb her throughout the night. He tries to cuddle, which wakes her up. The next morning, she tells him she can't do that again because she needs sleep, and he almost cried. She feels bad but is exhausted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. She worked long hours and needs rest. Her health and well-being are important. If her partner's behavior repeatedly disrupts her sleep, especially when she's already tired, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. Communication is key in relationships, and she did address the issue immediately. Her response was firm but not hostile\u2014she still showed affection the next morning.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected when she doesn't want to sleep with him. However, the priority here is her need for rest. Sleep is crucial, especially after a demanding schedule. The boyfriend's actions seem to be the root cause here. He was aware of the problem after her initial request but continued to disturb her. His reaction of almost crying might indicate he feels rejected, but the responsibility for the disruption lies with him. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that might influence this? In some contexts, sharing a bed is important for intimacy, but when health is at stake, personal needs should be prioritized. The author isn't refusing all physical contact; she's just asking for space to sleep. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs. \n\nThe author's actions were justified because she communicated her needs and the situation was affecting her health. The boyfriend's behavior was the initial problem. So, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
