Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend. The situation involves her being exhausted after a long day and dealing with his disruptive behavior during the night. \n\nFirst, the key points here are her need for sleep due to her busy schedule and his inability to stay still or quiet while sleeping. She tried to communicate her needs (telling him to turn off his phone, asking him to stop shaking the bed), but he kept disturbing her. She even mentions being pushed awake by his cuddling attempts. \n\nThe next morning, she tells him she can't do that again, leading him to almost cry. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting this boundary. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. She's clearly communicated her needs and tried to be understanding (\"I still love him\"), but her well-being is also important. Sleep is essential, especially for someone with her work schedule. If he can't adjust his behavior, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries, even if it means sleeping separately. \n\nHe might feel hurt, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. She's prioritizing her health. Unless there's a history of her being unreasonable or not considering his feelings, she's justified in her actions. The answer would likely be B (No), as she's protecting her needs and health.\n"
