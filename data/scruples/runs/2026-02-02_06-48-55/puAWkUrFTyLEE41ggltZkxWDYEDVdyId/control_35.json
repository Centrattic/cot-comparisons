Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore. The situation involves her being very tired after a long day of work and coaching, and her boyfriend's behaviors keeping her awake all night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman worked a 9-hour shift and coached for 2 hours, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend was making a lot of noise and physical disturbances\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard and ended up telling him she'd murder him if he did it again. In the morning, she communicated her need for sleep and that they can't do that again, even though she loves him. He was upset, nearly crying.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author's actions were to set a boundary due to her exhaustion and the boyfriend's disruptive behaviors. She communicated her needs clearly and felt bad afterward but maintained her stance because of her health and schedule. The boyfriend's actions included not respecting her need for sleep despite her requests, which is a valid concern. \n\nPossible angles: Is it unreasonable for her to ask to sleep separately? Relationships often require compromise. If the boyfriend is making noise, maybe he should adjust. But some might argue that sleeping in separate beds could be seen as a last resort and possibly hurtful. However, her well-being is important, and repeated disturbances after a long day could justify her decision. \n\nAlso, the context of how long they've been dating (a couple of weeks) might matter. Maybe she's being too quick to suggest separate beds instead of working through it? But given the severity of his actions and her clear communication, it might be reasonable. \n\nSo, weighing the arguments: Author's right to prioritize her health and sleep, boyfriend's failure to respect her space and need for rest. The answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong), because she's advocating for her needs and the boyfriend wasn't respecting her boundaries. However, the situation's nuances matter. If this is a recurring issue, maybe there's room for more discussion. But given the circumstances as described, she's justified.\n"
