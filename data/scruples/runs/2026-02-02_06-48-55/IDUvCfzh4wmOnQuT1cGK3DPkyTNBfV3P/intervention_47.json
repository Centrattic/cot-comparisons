I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother refusing a paternity test, and the author offering their DNA to help determine if the brother is the father. The brother and father are upset, thinking the author is betraying the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, a court can compel someone to take a paternity test if there's a legitimate need, like establishing child support. The brother's refusal might be legally problematic, so the author offering their DNA could be trying to help clarify things legally. However, the brother might not want to be involved, so the author's action could interfere with his rights.\n\nEthically, the author might think they're helping by providing evidence, but the brother's autonomy is important. Even if the brother is acting irrationally, the author shouldn't take actions that might force the court to get involved without his consent. Offering their own DNA could be seen as taking sides or overstepping, especially if the brother doesn't want to confirm paternity. \n\nThe father and brother's anger stems from feeling betrayed. The author might have thought they were helping, but without consulting the family first, it could be seen as a breach of trust. The question is whether the author had the right to offer their DNA without the brother's permission. \n\nIf the author didn't have the brother's consent and acted on their own, that could be a mistake. The court can handle it, so the author's intervention might not be necessary and could cause family conflict. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the brother's choice and for acting without consulting the family.\n"
