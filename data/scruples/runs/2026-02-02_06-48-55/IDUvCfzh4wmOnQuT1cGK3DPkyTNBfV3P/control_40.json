I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about their brother refusing a paternity test, and the author offered their DNA to help out. The ex is taking it to court, and the family is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a court can force someone to take a paternity test if it's in the child's best interest. The brother's refusal might be a problem because the court can compel him. The author offering their DNA\u2014would that be valid? Paternity tests usually require the father's DNA, not a sibling's. A sibling's DNA can show a familial match but not direct parentage. So maybe the ex didn't need the author's DNA because it's not conclusive for paternity. The court would need the actual father's DNA.\n\nEthically, the author's intention was to help, but maybe they didn't realize that offering their DNA wasn't the right approach. The family is upset because they see it as betrayal. The brother's actions are legally problematic, but the author's offer might have been well-meaning but misguided. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not the one refusing the test. Ethically, maybe they should have checked with the family first, but it's not a clear-cut case of being in the wrong. The family's reaction seems harsh given the brother's responsibility. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
