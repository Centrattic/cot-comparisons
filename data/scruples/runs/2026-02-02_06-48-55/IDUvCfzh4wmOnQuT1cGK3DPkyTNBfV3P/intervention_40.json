I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for offering their DNA when their brother refused a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the brother's ex is trying to establish paternity, probably to get child support. The brother is avoiding the test to dodge potential financial responsibility. The author, not knowing the legal implications, offers their DNA as a familial match. The ex declines because the court will handle it, but the family finds out and is upset, accusing the author of betrayal.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, if someone is a parent, they can be compelled by the court to take a paternity test. But the author isn't the parent; they're the sibling. Offering a DNA test doesn't directly prove paternity, but it might be used to suggest a family connection. However, since the brother is the alleged parent, the author's DNA isn't relevant for legal paternity unless there's some other angle. \n\nThe author's intention was to help, maybe to ensure the child is supported if the brother is the father. But the family sees this as interfering. Legally, the author isn't obligated to do anything here. The brother's actions are his own, and the author isn't involved in the legal matter. However, by offering DNA, the author might have overstepped, especially since it's not their legal matter to resolve. \n\nThe family's reaction is emotional, but does that mean the author was wrong? The author didn't know the legal stuff, but they might have assumed that providing DNA would help. However, in reality, it's the brother's responsibility. The author's action could be seen as meddling where they weren't asked, even if well-meaning. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. They didn't break any laws, but they might have acted without understanding the legal process and family dynamics. The answer might depend on the perspective: legally, no, but socially or within the family, yes. Since the question is about being in the wrong (possibly socially), the answer might be A.\n"
