I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for offering their DNA to help determine if their brother is the father of their sibling's child. The brother refused a paternity test to avoid child support, and the author, not knowing the legal implications, offered their own DNA. The ex was polite in declining, but the brother and father are upset, accusing the author of betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Paternity tests are typically required for the putative father, not siblings. The court's role is to ensure the child's best interest, which includes determining support obligations. So, by offering DNA, the author may have misunderstood the legal process. Legally, the brother is the one who needs to take the test, and the author's DNA isn't relevant for establishing legal paternity. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's intent was to help, but their brother's refusal was self-serving. The author didn't know the legal stuff, which is a key point. The ex didn't need the author's DNA, which shows the author might have overstepped without understanding the process. \n\nFamily dynamics are also important here. The brother and father feel betrayed, which suggests a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was good, the action might have been seen as interfering in a family matter. However, the brother's behavior (refusing the test to avoid responsibility) is problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They acted without full knowledge, leading to family conflict. But their intent was to help. The answer might hinge on intent versus outcome. Legally, the author's DNA isn't necessary. Ethically, the brother's responsibility lies in taking the test. The author might be in the right in trying to help but didn't know the legal implications, leading to unintended consequences. However, offering DNA without understanding the process could be seen as meddling. \n\nBut since the author didn't know better and the ex didn't need it, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. The brother's refusal is the real issue. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but their lack of knowledge led to a misunderstanding. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, because their intention was to help, and they acted out of good faith without malice.\n"
