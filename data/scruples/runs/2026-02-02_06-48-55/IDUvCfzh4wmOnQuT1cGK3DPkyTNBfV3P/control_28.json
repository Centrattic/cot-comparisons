I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is that their brother refused a paternity test, thinking it would avoid child support. The author offered their own DNA to help confirm paternity, but the ex didn't need it. The brother and father are upset, considering it a betrayal.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, the court can compel someone to take a paternity test. The brother's refusal isn't a legal shield because the court can force him. So the brother's reasoning is flawed. The author tried to help by offering their DNA, which is a familial match test. But the ex didn't need it, maybe because the court would handle it. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother and father feel betrayed, but the author didn't have to know all the legal details. The brother's actions are the main issue here. The author's intention was to help, even if their method might not have been the best. Since the ex didn't use the offer, maybe the author didn't cause direct harm. The family's anger is more about the brother's actions and the author's involvement. \n\nSo, the author's action was well-intentioned, even if their understanding was limited. They didn't force the brother to do the test, just offered their DNA. The brother's refusal is the real problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
