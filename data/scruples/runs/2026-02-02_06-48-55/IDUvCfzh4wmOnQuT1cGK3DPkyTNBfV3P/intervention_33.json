I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for offering their DNA to help determine paternity when their brother refused a paternity test. So, the brother's ex is involved in a legal situation where the brother won't take a test to confirm paternity, possibly to avoid child support. The author steps in and offers their own DNA for a familial match. The ex declines because the court can handle it, but the brother and father are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, courts can compel someone to take a paternity test if there's a legitimate need, right? So the brother might be mistaken in thinking refusing the test helps him avoid support. If the court can force the test, then his refusal might not protect him anyway. \n\nThen there's the author's action. By offering their DNA, the author is trying to help the ex prove that the brother is the father by showing a familial match. But if the ex already declined the court's process, maybe the author's offer isn't necessary. But the brother and father see this as a betrayal. \n\nEthically, is the author wrong? The brother is being irresponsible, but the author is trying to help the child, maybe? But maybe the author overstepped by offering their DNA without consulting the family first. The brother and father's reaction is about family loyalty versus doing what's right for the child. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to do anything. But by offering their DNA, could they be involved in some way? Probably not, unless there's a legal implication in their action. The ex didn't accept it, so maybe there's no legal consequence. \n\nThe brother's approach is problematic, but the author's intent was to help. However, the method of helping might have been intrusive. The father and brother's anger is about family loyalty, but the author's action might have been a misguided attempt to assist the ex. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to help a child, even if they didn't consider family dynamics. But maybe they should have discussed it with the brother first. However, since the brother was being reckless, the author's action was a good faith effort to rectify the situation. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
