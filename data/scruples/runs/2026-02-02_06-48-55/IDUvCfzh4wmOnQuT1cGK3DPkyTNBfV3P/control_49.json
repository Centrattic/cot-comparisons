I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is their brother's ex is involved in a paternity case, and the brother refuses to take a test to avoid potential child support. The author offers their own DNA for a familial match, but the ex declines, saying the court will handle it. However, the brother and father get angry, thinking the author is betraying the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The brother not taking the test might be a legal error because if the court can compel him, then his refusal might not protect him. The author, not knowing legal stuff, offers their DNA, thinking it might help. But the ex doesn't need it because the court can force the test. So maybe the author's action wasn't necessary but wasn't illegal.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to help clarify the situation, even if their brother is being difficult. However, the family perceives this as betrayal. The key points are intent and whether the action was harmful. The author's intention was likely to assist, not to sabotage. Since the ex didn't use the offer, the author's action didn't actually cause harm. The family's anger is more about protecting their brother, perhaps fearing financial responsibility, rather than the author's actions being wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
