I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother refusing a paternity test, and the author offering their own DNA to help figure out if the brother is the father. The ex-girlfriend said she doesn't need it because the court will handle it, but the brother and father are upset, thinking the author betrayed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Paternity tests usually require the father's participation for legal validity. If the brother refuses, the court can force him to take the test. By offering their DNA, the author is trying to help establish a familial connection, but that might not be legally sufficient. However, the author didn't do anything illegal; they just offered their DNA. \n\nNext, the family dynamics. The brother and father are upset because they see this as betrayal. But the author's intention was to help clarify the situation, not necessarily to harm the brother. The brother's refusal is causing the problem, and the author is trying to assist in a different way. \n\nEthically, is the author wrong? They didn't know the legal implications but acted with good intentions. The ex-girlfriend didn't need the DNA, so maybe the author's offer wasn't necessary. But the brother and father's anger seems misplaced because the author isn't the one refusing the test. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and didn't do anything illegal. The fault lies with the brother for refusing the test. Answer B.\n"
