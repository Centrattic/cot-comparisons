I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault. The situation is about offering their DNA for a paternity test because their brother refuses. The brother's ex needs to establish paternity, but he won't take the test. The author offers their own DNA to help, but the ex says the court will handle it. Then the brother and father get angry, thinking the author betrayed them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Legally, the brother is avoiding the paternity test to dodge potential child support. The author, not knowing much about the law, offers their DNA to help. But the ex already mentioned the court can compel the test. The author's intention was to help, but maybe they overstepped.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to assist. However, family dynamics play a role. The brother and father are upset because the author took action without consulting them. But the author didn't know the legal aspects. The ex didn't need the DNA, so maybe the author's action wasn't necessary. Still, the intent was good. The father and brother's reaction might be harsh. In terms of ethics, sharing family DNA could be a privacy issue. But since the author's own DNA is involved, they might have the right to offer it. \n\nThe key points are the author's good intentions, lack of legal knowledge, and the family's reaction. Legally, if the court can force the brother to take the test, the author's DNA offer was unnecessary. But morally, the author tried to help. The father and brother might feel the author meddled. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not, because they acted with good intentions and the ex didn't need the DNA. The answer is B.\n"
