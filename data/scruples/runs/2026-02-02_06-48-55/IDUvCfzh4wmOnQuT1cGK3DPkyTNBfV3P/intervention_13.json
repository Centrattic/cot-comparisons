I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother not doing a paternity test, and the author offering their DNA to help. The legal aspect is important here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal implications. In many jurisdictions, a court can compel someone to take a paternity test if it's in the best interest of the child or to determine custody/support. The brother's refusal might be a problem legally, but the author stepping in by offering their own DNA\u2014does that help? Well, if the brother is the father, the author's DNA wouldn't establish paternity unless there's a direct line, which isn't the case here. So maybe the ex was right in saying she doesn't need the author's DNA. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help the ex, which could be seen as trying to bypass the brother's refusal. However, the author didn't do anything illegal by offering their DNA. The issue is more about family dynamics and trust. The brother and father are upset because the author tried to help the ex, which they perceive as betrayal. The author might not have realized the legal process is already in place and that their offer wasn't necessary. But was it wrong to offer? The author didn't break any laws, but maybe acted without considering the family's feelings. So the answer might be A, but I need to check if the action was legally justifiable or if it's a family matter where intentions don't matter.\n"
