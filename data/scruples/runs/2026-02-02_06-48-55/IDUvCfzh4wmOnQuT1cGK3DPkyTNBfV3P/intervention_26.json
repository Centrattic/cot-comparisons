I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the brother refused a paternity test, thinking it would protect him from child support. The author offered their DNA to help, but the ex said the court would handle it. The brother and father are angry, seeing it as betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the brother is avoiding the test, the court can force him to do it. The author's offer might not have been necessary legally. But maybe the ex thought the author's DNA could help prove a familial connection? However, the ex declined because the court would handle it. So the author's action might not have been needed legally.\n\nThen, the family dynamics. The brother's reasoning is flawed. Refusing a paternity test doesn't prevent legal action. Courts can order tests. The author's intent was to help clarify the situation, but the brother and father see it as betrayal. The author didn't know the legal process, so maybe they acted without full understanding.\n\nWas the author's action wrong? Legally, maybe not. Offering DNA isn't illegal. But ethically, did they overstep? The brother has the right to refuse, and the author stepping in might have been seen as interfering. However, the author's intention was to help, albeit with a misunderstanding of the legal process. The father's anger is about family loyalty, so the author might feel betrayed. But the author's action wasn't malicious. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, the author shouldn't have involved themselves in their brother's legal matter without consulting, leading to family conflict. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But considering the good intention and lack of legal wrongdoing, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
