I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the brother's ex had a baby, and he refused a paternity test. The user offered their own DNA to help establish a familial match, but the court said they don't need it and will handle it. The brother and father are upset, thinking the user betrayed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the court can compel someone to take a paternity test, especially if it's a legal matter like child support. So the brother's refusal might not prevent the court from forcing a test. The user's offer might have been unnecessary, but was it harmful?\n\nThe user's intention was to help the ex prove paternity, which could lead to the brother being legally obligated for child support. The brother and father are angry because they feel the user is trying to harm the brother's interests. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by helping the ex, but maybe they didn't realize that the court would handle it without their DNA.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? If the user's action didn't actually help the court case, but the brother and father feel betrayed, then maybe the user overstepped. However, if the user was trying to do the right thing by supporting the child's potential father (their brother) or the mother, it's a gray area. Legally, the user might not be in the wrong, but socially, they might have caused family conflict by getting involved without understanding the legal process. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user's intent was to help, but the outcome was unintended family tension.\n"
