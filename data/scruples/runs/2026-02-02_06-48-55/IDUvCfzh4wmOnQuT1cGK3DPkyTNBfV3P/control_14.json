I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for offering their DNA to help establish paternity for their brother's child. The brother refused the test, thinking it would protect him from child support, but the sister offered her DNA to help. The ex was polite and said she didn't need it, but the brother and father got angry.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, if someone is being asked for a paternity test, they can't just refuse without legal consequences. Courts can compel them to take it. So the brother's reasoning is flawed. But the sister, offering her DNA, might not be necessary because the brother is the one the court needs to test. However, she's trying to help, right? \n\nIs she overstepping? Maybe. But she didn't force the ex to take it; she just offered. The ex declined, so there's no action taken. The brother and father are upset because they feel she's betraying the family. But from a legal standpoint, she's not doing anything illegal. She's trying to help resolve the situation, perhaps out of concern for the child. \n\nThe key here is intent. If her intention was to help clarify paternity and support the child, even if her brother is being stubborn, then she's acting in good faith. The brother's refusal is his own issue. The sister isn't the one needing the test; she's just offering assistance. So legally and ethically, she isn't in the wrong. The family's anger is misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
