I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for offering their DNA when their brother refused a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the brother didn't take the test to avoid potential child support. The author, not knowing legal details, offers their DNA to help determine if there's a familial connection. The ex didn't need it because the court can force a test. But the brother and father are upset, thinking the author betrayed them.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author overstep by offering their DNA? Well, the author's intention wasn't to harm the brother but to help clarify the situation. However, the brother's refusal was his own decision. The author might not have considered that the brother's choice to avoid the test was his own, so offering DNA could be seen as interfering. But legally, the court can handle it. The author's action, while well-meaning, might have caused family conflict. But legally, they didn't do anything wrong. The brother's anger is more about family dynamics than legal fault. So, the author isn't at fault.\n"
