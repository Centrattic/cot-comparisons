I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother refused a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help determine paternity. The ex-girlfriend didn't need it because the court would handle it, but the brother and father got angry at the author for \"betraying the family\" and trying to harm the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal implications. If the brother is the father, he's legally responsible for child support. By refusing the test, he's trying to avoid that responsibility, which might be illegal. The author offered their DNA as an alternative. However, the author isn't the father, so their DNA wouldn't establish paternity. The ex didn't need the DNA because the court would compel the test. But the family is upset.\n\nEthically, is the author wrong? The author might have thought they were helping clarify the situation, especially if they believed the brother was the father. However, the author might not have considered that their DNA isn't relevant. Plus, the brother's refusal is his own choice, and the author stepping in could have been seen as overstepping. But the author didn't force the test; they just offered help. The family's reaction is about betrayal, but the author's intention might have been to help. Legally, maybe the brother is in the wrong, but the question is about the author.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), because the author's action, while perhaps misguided, wasn't malicious. They tried to help, even if their method wasn't correct. The brother's and father's anger is misplaced. The author isn't the one avoiding legal responsibility. However, maybe the author should have realized their DNA wasn't helpful. But the ex already said she didn't need it, so the author's offer was unnecessary but not wrong.\n"
