I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault here. The situation is that the brother refused a paternity test, and the author offered their own DNA to help determine if the brother is the father. The ex doesn't need it because the court can force the test, but the brother and father are upset, thinking the author betrayed the family.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The brother's refusal is his own choice, maybe to avoid legal responsibility. The author's offer to help with DNA might be seen as trying to prove the brother's paternity, which could lead to child support obligations. But the ex said the court would handle it, so maybe the author's offer was unnecessary. However, the author didn't know the legal process well. \n\nIs the author at fault for offering their DNA? Well, the brother's ex didn't use the offer, so maybe the author's intention was to help clarify the situation, but the brother and father see it as a betrayal. But the author didn't have malicious intent. Legally, the brother can't avoid the court's order for a test, so maybe the author's action didn't actually affect the outcome. However, family dynamics might mean the author overstepped by offering their own DNA without consulting the brother first. \n\nBut the brother's refusal is his own problem. The author's action might have been well-intentioned to help the child or ensure the right parent takes responsibility. The father and brother being angry could be because they feel the author is causing family issues. But legally, the author isn't at fault. Emotionally, maybe the situation is complex, but the question is about being in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because the author didn't do anything illegal and had good intentions, even if it caused family tension.\n"
