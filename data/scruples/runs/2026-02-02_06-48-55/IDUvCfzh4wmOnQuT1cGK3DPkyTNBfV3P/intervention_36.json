I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is that their brother refused a paternity test, and the author offered their own DNA instead. The ex is using the court to compel the test, but the author's brother and father are upset, thinking the author betrayed the family.\n\nHmm. The author's intention was to help clarify the paternity issue by offering their DNA, but maybe they didn't consider the legal implications. If the brother is the one who is the potential father, then offering the author's DNA might not help in determining if the brother is the father. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, the author's DNA would show if the baby is related to their family, but if the brother is the one in question, the test should be on him, not the author. So by offering the author's DNA, they might have actually been trying to help the ex by providing a familial match, which could be used to argue that the baby is part of the family. But the court would need the brother's DNA for that. \n\nThe brother's refusal might be based on a misunderstanding of the law. The court can compel him to take a test, so his thinking is flawed. The author, trying to help the ex, offered their own DNA, but that's not the right approach. The ex already said the court would handle it. The author's action could have been unnecessary and perhaps misinterpreted as trying to incriminate the brother, even if that wasn't the intent. The family is upset about being \"betrayed,\" but the author might not have realized the consequences of their offer. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They meant well, but maybe overstepped by offering their DNA without understanding the legal process. They could have been trying to help, but it's possible they didn't communicate properly with the ex or the brother, leading to family conflict. The brother's refusal is his own issue, but the author's action might have added fuel to the fire by not following the correct legal steps. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not knowing the legal procedures and for not considering the family's perspective.\n"
