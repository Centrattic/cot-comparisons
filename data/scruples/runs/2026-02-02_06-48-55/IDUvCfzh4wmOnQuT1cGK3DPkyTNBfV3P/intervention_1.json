I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that their brother had a child with an ex-girlfriend, and the brother refused to do a paternity test because he thought that would protect him from child support. The writer offered their own DNA to help determine if there's a family match, but the ex didn't need it since the court would handle it. Now the brother and father are angry, saying the writer betrayed the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the brother is the father, he has a legal responsibility. If he refuses the test, the court can compel him to do it. The writer offering their DNA might not be necessary because the court can force the actual father (the brother) to take the test. But does offering DNA help or harm? If the writer's DNA is used to suggest a familial link, maybe it could be misinterpreted, but the ex already said she didn't need it.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The brother is acting out of self-interest, possibly not wanting to pay child support. The writer, perhaps out of concern for the child or wanting to help the ex, offers their DNA. But the family sees this as betrayal because it might expose the brother's refusal or the possible paternity. The writer might not have understood that the brother's refusal is a legal issue that the court can handle, making their offer unnecessary. The brother and father might feel that the writer's action could lead to legal consequences for the brother, hence the anger.\n\nIs the writer legally in the wrong? Probably not. Offering DNA isn't illegal. But ethically, maybe they overstepped by trying to help without understanding the legal process. The ex already said she didn't need it, so maybe the writer's action was unnecessary and could have caused family conflict. But was it wrong? If the writer had good intentions, maybe not, but the outcome caused family issues. However, the brother's refusal is the root problem. The writer's action might have been a misguided attempt to help, but since the ex didn't use the offer, maybe it wasn't the right approach. So maybe the writer is partially in the wrong for not understanding the legal process and causing family strife, but not entirely.\n"
