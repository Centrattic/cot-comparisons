I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is about their brother refusing a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help. The brother and father are angry, calling it betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Paternity tests are usually a legal matter. If the brother is avoiding a test to avoid child support, the court might indeed compel him to take one. The author offered their DNA, which could be part of a familial DNA test, but the ex said the court would handle it. So maybe the author's offer was unnecessary but well-intentioned.\n\nEthically, the author might have thought they were helping by providing evidence. But the brother's refusal could be due to his own fears about financial responsibility. The author's action might have made the brother feel like their family is turning against them. However, the author didn't know the legal process, so maybe they didn't realize the test wasn't needed yet.\n\nIs the author at fault? The key points: Did they overstep? The brother is an adult, so the author isn't necessarily responsible for his actions. Offering DNA might not be illegal, but it's a sensitive family matter. The ex's response suggests the court would handle it, so the author's offer might have been premature. But the intention was to help, not harm. The brother's anger is about feeling betrayed, but the author's intent was to assist. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to help without malicious intent. However, it's a family conflict, so it's messy. The father's reaction might be about protecting the brother's interests. But legally and ethically, offering DNA isn't wrong. So B.\n"
