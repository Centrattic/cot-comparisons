I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity. The situation involves a back-and-forth where the transgender friend accused the author of pretending to be English, and the author responded with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the friendship. They have a teasing relationship where they take shots at each other. The author feels that their friend was being a \"baby\" when she got offended. But I should think about the sensitivity of the topics involved. The friend is transitioning, which is a significant and personal aspect of her identity. The author's response used the friend's transgender identity as a retort, which might have been hurtful even if they're used to teasing.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They were defending their national identity, which they've struggled with. However, using the friend's gender identity to counter her point could come across as dismissive of her experience. The author mentions they've talked about each other's difficulties, so they should understand the sensitivity of identity issues for both parties.\n\nAlso, the immediate reaction of the friend\u2014her smile wiping out\u2014indicates she felt hurt. Even if the author thinks she's overreacting, the response targeted a core part of her identity, which is more sensitive than the author's national identity issue. The comparison might not be fair because gender transition is a more personal and often more challenging process than cultural identity struggles, though both are valid.\n\nI should consider the principle of reciprocity in friendships. If the author were to be called out for their own identity struggles in a similar way, how would they feel? The friend's comment was about the author's self-identification, while the author's response was about the friend's gender identity. The latter is a more intrinsic part of her identity and might be more painful to address in a teasing manner.\n\nMoreover, the author's follow-up thought about the friend being a \"baby\" suggests they didn't consider her feelings. Even in a teasing friendship, there's a line where the joke becomes harmful. The author might have crossed that line by using the friend's transgender status as a weapon in the argument.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friendship allows for some teasing, the author's comment likely went too far by linking the friend's gender identity to the argument, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
