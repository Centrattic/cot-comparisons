I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo the person is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend who transitions from male to female. They have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the person for pretending to be English when they're Chinese. The person replied with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender. The friend was offended, and the person thinks she was being a baby.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person's ethnic identity vs the friend's gender identity. The friend made a comment about not being English, which the author responded to with an \"ironic\" remark. The author might have thought it was a valid retort, but the friend was offended.\n\nTrans people often face invalidation of their identity, so comparing the friend's experience of being transgender to the author's ethnic identity could be seen as minimizing the friend's experience. Even if they've discussed their difficulties, the author's response might come across as dismissive. The friend's comment was about the author's identity, and the author retorted by pointing out the friend's transgender status, which might be considered a personal attack or hypocrisy, but maybe not appropriate in this context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have a teasing relationship, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the friend found the joke in this instance. The friend's reaction was immediate offense, so the author might not have considered how their comment would be received. Even if they both share experiences of not fitting in, using the friend's transgender status as a counter could be hurtful.\n\nSo, the author's response might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, similar to how the friend invalidated the author's national identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they used the friend's transgender identity to mock the friend's criticism, which could be hurtful regardless of the friendship dynamics.\n"
