I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to their transgender friend's comment. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is trans. The friend called out the author's national identity, saying they're not English but Chinese, and the author replied with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend being transgender.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend was making a personal comment about the author's identity, and the author countered with a reference to the friend's own identity as a trans person. The friend was offended, and the author considered them being a \"baby.\"\n\nIn discussions about identity, especially when it's a sensitive topic like being transgender, using someone's identity as a counterpoint can be hurtful. Even if both people have faced challenges with their identities, the way the author responded was dismissive and potentially hurtful. The author's comment was not just pointing out the irony but using it in a way that mocked the friend's identity, which is a sensitive and personal aspect of their life.\n\nThe friend's comment was about the author's ethnic and national identity, which the author has experienced as a difficult part of their life. However, the author's response used the friend's transgender identity in a similar way, which can be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. It's important to recognize that while both may have struggles with their identities, the contexts are different, and the author's choice of words could be perceived as belittling.\n\nThe author might not have intended to be cruel, but the response was likely hurtful. In relationships where people tease each other, knowing the boundaries is crucial. If the friend was already discussing their own struggles with accepting their identity, bringing up their transgender status in a teasing or ironic manner could cross a line.\n\nTherefore, the author's response was inappropriate and inconsiderate, making them at fault in this situation.\n"
