I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English, and the author responded with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend being transgender.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's comment about the author's identity and the author's response. The author is defending their identity, but using the friend's transgender identity as a retort. The question is whether that response was appropriate.\n\nTransgender individuals often face being invalidated or dismissed in their identities. The friend's comment to the author might have been hurtful, but the author's response could be seen as equally dismissive. By pointing out the friend's transgender status, the author might be implying that the friend's identity is also something to be questioned, which can be hurtful.\n\nEven if they have a teasing relationship, using someone's gender identity to shut down their valid feelings could be problematic. The author's friend was pointing out a real issue the author faced with their dual identity, and the author's response might come off as minimizing that. The friend's experience of transitioning is real, and the author's response could be seen as invalidating their journey.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have talked about each other's struggles, which suggests they should understand the sensitivity of identities. So using that as a retort without considering the impact might be wrong. The author's friend might have felt dismissed, and the author's thought that the friend was being a \"baby\" shows a lack of empathy here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's response was probably hurtful and dismissive, even if the initial comment from the friend was also problematic. The author should have handled the situation with more empathy, considering their friend's perspective and the sensitivity around both identities.\n"
