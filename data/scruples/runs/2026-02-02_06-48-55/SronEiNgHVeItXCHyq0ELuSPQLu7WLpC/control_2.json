I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is ethnically Chinese, born and raised in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female, and they have a teasing relationship. In a conversation about cultures, the friend called out the author for not being English, saying they're Chinese. The author responded with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person,\" which made the friend upset. The author then felt the friend was overreacting.\n\nHmm. The core issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend was making a comment about the author's national identity, so the author retorts with a comment about the friend's transgender identity. The author is pointing out irony, suggesting that the friend's own transition is a case of \"you're not something, so stop pretending,\" which is the same accusation the friend made against the author.\n\nBut does that make the author right or wrong? Well, in terms of interpersonal dynamics, even if there's some truth in the irony, the response can come off as dismissive or hurtful. The friend was likely sharing their own experience of identity, and the author's reply might be seen as invalidating that by comparing it to their own experience. Both face challenges with identity, but the way the author brought up the comparison might not be the best approach. Also, using someone else's identity as a counterpoint in an argument, even if it's a joke or a tease, can be seen as insensitive. The friend was probably feeling defensive, and the author's response might have been a bit cruel, even if they meant it as a point about irony. So I think the author is in the wrong here because the response was not considerate and could have been hurtful, even if they intended to highlight a contradiction.\n"
