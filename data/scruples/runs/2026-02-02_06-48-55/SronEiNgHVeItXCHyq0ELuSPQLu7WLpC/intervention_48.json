I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Chinese-British person who's called out their transgender friend after the friend questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is ethnically Chinese but identifies as both British and Chinese. The friend, who is transgender, made a comment about the author not being English and then the author retorted with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend's transgender identity. \n\nThe key points here are the use of a person's identity as a retort. The author's friend was sensitive about the author's dual identity, and the author used the friend's transgender identity to make a sarcastic point. Even if they've had discussions about each other's challenges, using someone's identity in a teasing or confrontational way can be problematic. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being clever by pointing out the hypocrisy, but using \"transgender\" as a joke can be hurtful and dismissive. The friend's reaction (smile wiped out) suggests that the comment was taken as an attack. Even if the author feels they have mutual understanding, the line crossed here is using someone's personal identity in a way that's likely to offend, especially in the context of a teasing relationship where boundaries might not be as clear. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they used an identity-related retort that caused offense, even if the intention was to highlight hypocrisy. The friend's transgender identity is a core part of who she is, and using it as a weapon in an argument, even in a teasing context, isn't appropriate. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n"
