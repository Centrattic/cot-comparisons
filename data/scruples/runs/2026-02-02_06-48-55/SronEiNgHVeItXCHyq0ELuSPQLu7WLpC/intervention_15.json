I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity. The situation involves a back-and-forth where the friend criticized the author's identity, and the author retorted with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend's transgender status.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. The friend is transgender, transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing relationship. The friend makes a comment about the author not being English, leading the author to respond with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend's transgender identity.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend had a history of discussing their own struggles with identity. The author points out the irony of the friend dismissing their identity when the friend herself is undergoing a similar identity change. However, the author's comment is a direct jab at the friend's transgender status, which might be seen as dismissive or hurtful, even if it's meant as a retort.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The friend was already sensitive about their identity. The author's response could be seen as using the friend's personal struggle as a counterpoint in a way that's not constructive. Even though both have discussed their challenges, the author's comment might come off as mocking the friend's transgender identity, which is a sensitive issue. The friend's reaction (smile wiped out) suggests they felt hurt. The author might think it's just teasing, but the context of transitioning and the potential for transphobia or insensitivity is important here.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, even if both parties have talked about their struggles, using someone's identity-related issues as a jab, especially in the context of a sensitive topic like gender transition, is likely inconsiderate. The author didn't address the friend's comment constructively but instead turned it into a personal attack, which can be hurtful. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
