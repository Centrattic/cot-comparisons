I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they called out their transgender friend for questioning their national identity. The author is ethnically Chinese but identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transitioning and they have a teasing relationship.\n\nSo the friend makes a comment about the author not being English, to which the author responds with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender. The friend gets offended. The author thinks the friend is being a baby.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. Both people have discussed their struggles with identity. The author's friend brought up the author's ethnic background, and the author countered with the friend's transgender identity. The key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate comeback or if it was dismissive and hurtful.\n\nTransgender issues are sensitive, especially when it comes to identity acceptance. The friend's transition is a significant part of her identity. By using that as a retort, the author might be trivializing her identity. Even if they tease each other, there's a line where the joke becomes harmful. The friend's reaction indicates that it crossed that line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that both have shared their struggles. The friend's comment was about the author's national identity, which the author has experienced themselves. However, responding by pointing out her transgender status might not be a fair comparison. The author's identity struggle is about ethnicity and nationality, while the friend's is about gender. They are different issues, even if both are related to identity. Using one to dismiss the other's feelings isn't fair. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being clever with irony, but it's possible they didn't consider how it would affect the friend. The friend's smile disappearing shows she felt hurt. The author's justification that the friend is being a baby suggests they don't see the validity of her feelings. That's a red flag because it's dismissive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the friend's initial comment was a bit harsh, the author's response was probably more hurtful. The line between playful teasing and crossing into sensitive territory can be thin. Since the friend is transgender and the author knows her struggles, bringing up her identity in that way could be seen as invalidating her experience. The author might have thought they were making a point, but it ended up being hurtful and inappropriate. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
