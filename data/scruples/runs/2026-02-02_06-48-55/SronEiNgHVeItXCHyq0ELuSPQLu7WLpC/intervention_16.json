I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is ethnically Chinese, born and raised in Britain, identifying as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female. Their relationship includes some teasing. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English when they're Chinese. The author responded by pointing out the irony, referencing the friend being transgender. The friend was offended, and the author thought she was being a baby.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comment about the author's national identity is a personal jab. The author's retort uses the friend's transgender identity to highlight the irony. The question is if this was a valid or respectful way to respond.\n\nTransgender individuals often face discrimination and invalidation of their identity. Using someone's gender identity as a retort in an argument, even in a teasing context, can be hurtful. The author's response seems to equate the friend's transgender status with the author's own ethnic identity, but they are different experiences. While both involve identity struggles, comparing one's ethnic identity to another's gender identity might not be a fair comparison. The friend might feel that her transition is a serious and personal journey, and having it used as a punchline, even in a teasing manner, is dismissive of her experience.\n\nThe author mentions that they've discussed each other's challenges before. However, bringing up the friend's transgender identity in a confrontational way during an argument could still be seen as insensitive. The author might have thought it was a valid point, but the friend's reaction shows that it was hurtful. The author's follow-up thought that the friend was \"being a baby\" suggests a lack of empathy, which could exacerbate the issue.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's response was probably not appropriate. Even if the friend made the first jab, using the friend's transgender identity to counter it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have intended to highlight shared experiences of identity struggles, but the execution was hurtful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
