I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. They've dealt with not being seen as British and having a dual identity. The friend is transitioning from male to female and they have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English, leading the author to respond with an ironic jab referencing the friend's transgender identity.\n\nThe key here is understanding the dynamics. The author feels their identity was being invalidated by the friend. The friend's comment was about the author's ethnicity, pointing out that they're not ethnically British. The author's response was to highlight the irony that the friend, who is transgender, is commenting on identity. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend was transitioning, so the author used the friend's identity as a counterargument. Even if the author feels wronged, using someone's personal identity (like being transgender) in a teasing or confrontational way can be hurtful. The friend's reaction was immediate offense, indicating that the comment crossed a line. \n\nThe author mentions they've discussed their struggles with identity and the friend's struggles. That shows mutual understanding, but the author's response here didn't engage with that mutual understanding. Instead, it weaponized the friend's identity. Even if the intention was to point out hypocrisy, the method was hurtful. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not\" from the friend seems to be a critique of the author's claim to being English. The author's response was to flip it back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\" This could imply that the friend is pretending to be something they're not, which is a sensitive topic for someone transitioning. \n\nIn such situations, even if the initial comment was a personal jab, using someone's identity in a similar way might not be the best approach. The author might have thought it was a valid retort, but it's possible they didn't consider how it would make their friend feel. The friend's immediate reaction shows that it caused pain, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity struggles in that moment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they used a personal and sensitive aspect of their friend's identity to counter a joke, which caused hurt. Even if the friend's comment was a joke, the author's response was not the best way to handle it.\n"
