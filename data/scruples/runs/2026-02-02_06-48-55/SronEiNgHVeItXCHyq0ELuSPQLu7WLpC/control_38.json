I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a Chinese person born in Britain who identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend who is transitioning from male to female, and they have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the author's national identity, saying they aren't English but Chinese, and the author responded with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender. The friend was offended, and the author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've discussed their shared experiences of not fitting into one identity\u2014author with dual cultural identity and the friend with transgender identity. They both have valid struggles. The friend's comment was about the author's identity, pointing out they aren't English, which might have been a sensitive topic for the author. When the author retorts with the transgender comment, it's an attempt at irony, but the friend is offended.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and the appropriateness of the retort. The author's friend was making a point about identity, and the author's response was a comparison to transgender identity. Even if they both discussed their challenges, using someone's transgender status as a retort in a teasing manner might cross a line. Transgender issues are often sensitive and not something people take lightly. The friend might feel that their identity is being trivialized or used as a joke, even if the author thought it was a mutual tease.\n\nAlso, the term \"transgender person\" isn't inherently offensive, but the way it's used here could be. If the author made it sound dismissive or mocking, that's a problem. The friend's immediate reaction shows that the comment was hurtful. The author might have thought it's okay because of their friendship and previous discussions, but that doesn't automatically make it appropriate. Even in close friendships, certain topics can be sensitive.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend was pointing out the author's identity, which the author has struggled with. The author's response might have been a defense mechanism, but using the friend's transgender status in that way could be seen as invalidating their experience. It's like saying, \"You don't know what real identity struggles are,\" which isn't helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely hurtful and dismissive, even if intended as a joke. The friend's reaction suggests they felt disrespected. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
