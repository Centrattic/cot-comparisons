I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is ethnically Chinese, born and raised in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. They're friends with a transgender woman, and there's some teasing going on. The friend criticizes the author for pretending to be English when they're actually Chinese, and the author responds with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend being transgender. The author then got defensive and thought the friend was being a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend is transitioning from male to female. The author points out the irony of the friend's comment by referencing her transgender identity. The friend's reaction was to be offended. The author's response seems to be a direct retort, using the friend's identity to highlight hypocrisy. But is that okay?\n\nTransgender people often navigate their identity and can face a lot of societal challenges. The author mentions that both have discussed their struggles\u2014author with dual identity, friend with gender identity. The author's response might be seen as using the friend's transgender status to shut down the criticism, which could be dismissive or hurtful. Even if the author felt the comment was justified, the way they responded might not consider the friend's feelings.\n\nAlso, the term \"transgender\" is an identity label. Using it in a teasing or sarcastic way might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. The friend's comment about the author's national identity could be a sensitive topic for the author, but responding with a jab about the friend's gender identity might not be the healthiest approach. It could be perceived as attacking her identity instead of addressing the issue.\n\nThe author's defense is that they had previously discussed their struggles, implying mutual understanding. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the author's retort was appropriate. It's possible that the author didn't realize the impact of their words. The key here is whether the response was inconsiderate or not. The friend's smile disappearing and being offended suggests it was hurtful.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they used their friend's transgender identity to deflect or mock the criticism, which could be seen as cruel or insensitive, even if they had discussed similar struggles. The response might have been a form of gaslighting or invalidating the friend's feelings, which isn't right.\n"
