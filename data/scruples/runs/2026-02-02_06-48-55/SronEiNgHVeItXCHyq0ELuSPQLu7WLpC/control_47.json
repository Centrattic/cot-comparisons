I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is ethnically Chinese, born and raised in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female. There's a teasing dynamic between them. The friend questions the author's British identity, saying they're Chinese and shouldn't pretend to be English. The author responds by pointing out the irony of the friend being transgender, which offends the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was being called out for their national identity, which is a sensitive topic for them. They feel they don't fully belong to either culture. The friend, who is transgender, is pointing out that the author isn't English. The author retaliates by pointing out the friend's transgender identity, which the friend finds offensive.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual experiences of identity struggles. Both the author and the friend have faced challenges with their identities. The author's friend was transitioning, and the author had shared their own feelings about not belonging. So, the author might have thought using the friend's transgender status was a valid retort, given the friend's own comment about the author's identity.\n\nBut the problem is that bringing up someone's gender identity in a teasing or retaliatory way can be hurtful, even if both parties have discussed their struggles before. The friend might have felt that the author was invalidating their experience by using their identity in a way that's not respectful. Even in a teasing relationship, there are boundaries. The friend's reaction (smile wiped out) shows they felt disrespected or offended.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"ironic, coming from a transgender person\" implies that the friend's comment is hypocritical because the friend is transgender. However, the friend's comment was about the author's national identity, not about gender identity. The connection the author is making might be a stretch here. The friend's identity as transgender relates to gender, while the author's identity is about ethnicity and nationality. Comparing these two might not be a fair or accurate comparison, even if both are about identity.\n\nMoreover, even if both have discussed their struggles, using someone's identity in a way that could be seen as mocking or as a put-down is generally not appropriate. The friend might have felt that their transgender identity was being used as a weapon in the exchange rather than being acknowledged with empathy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's response was a form of retort that could be seen as dismissive and potentially hurtful. The friend's experience as transgender is personal and sensitive, and using it in a conversation where the friend is already feeling defensive might cross a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here for not considering the impact of their words on their friend's feelings.\n"
