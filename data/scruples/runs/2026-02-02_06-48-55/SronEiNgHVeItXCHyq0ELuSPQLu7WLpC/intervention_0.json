I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after the friend questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author is ethnically Chinese born in Britain, identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English, and the author responded with an \"ironic\" comment about the friend being transgender. The friend was clearly offended.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's friend was pointing out the author's non-English identity, which the author had previously discussed being a sensitive issue. The author used the friend's transgender identity as a counterpoint, implying hypocrisy. But the friend's identity is a deeply personal and valid part of who they are, while the author's national identity is different in nature. The author's comment might have been intended as a tease, but it's using the friend's identity to dismiss their point, which can be hurtful. Even if they have a teasing relationship, using someone's identity in a way that could be seen as mocking or trivializing their experiences is problematic. The friend's experience as transgender is real and significant, and the author's response might come across as invalidating that struggle. Also, the author's comment could be perceived as comparing their own identity issues to the friend's, which isn't equivalent. So, while the author might have felt defensive, the response was likely inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
