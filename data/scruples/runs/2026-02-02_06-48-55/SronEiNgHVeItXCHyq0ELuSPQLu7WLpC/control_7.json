I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she criticized their national identity.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transgender, transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing friendship. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English, and the author responded with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\" The friend was offended.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The friend's comment about the author's identity: The friend said, \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\" The author's friend is pointing out the author's ethnic background in a way that might dismiss their British identity. The author feels they have a right to identify as both, which is a valid experience for someone with a mixed cultural background.\n\n2. The author's response: By saying \"ironic, coming from a transgender person,\" the author is drawing a parallel between their own experience of identity and the friend's transgender experience. However, using the term \"transgender person\" in this context might come off as dismissive or as an attack on the friend's identity. The friend might feel that the author is reducing their serious experience to a comparison, which could be hurtful.\n\n3. The dynamic between them: The author mentions they have a teasing relationship. But teasing can cross a line when it touches on sensitive personal issues. The friend's transition is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and using it in a retort, even in a joking manner, could be seen as invalidating or mocking their experience.\n\n4. The aftermath: The friend was immediately offended, and the author thought the friend was being a baby. This suggests the author didn't consider the impact of their words. The friend might have felt disrespected, especially since both have discussed their struggles with identity. The author's response might undermine the friend's feelings.\n\n5. Understanding intersectionality: Both individuals have experiences of struggling with their identities. The author's response might not acknowledge the friend's vulnerability and instead use it as a weapon in their banter, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's response, while perhaps intended as a retort, might have been hurtful and not appropriate in the context of their friendship. Even if there's a teasing dynamic, bringing up someone's transgender identity in a confrontational way can be deeply hurtful. The key is that the author didn't consider how their words would affect their friend, especially given the friend's own struggles with identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
