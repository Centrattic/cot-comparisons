I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, the author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing relationship where they often joke or take shots at each other.\n\nIn this situation, the friend criticized the author for pretending to be English when they're Chinese. The author responded with an ironic comment pointing out the friend's transgender identity. The friend was offended, but the author didn't think they were at fault.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author's friend brought up the author's national identity, which is a sensitive topic for the author. The author then used the friend's transgender identity to highlight the irony. Even though they have a teasing dynamic, bringing up someone's identity in a potentially hurtful way can be problematic. \n\nTransgender individuals often face invalidation of their identity, and pointing out their transition in a confrontational manner can be seen as dismissive or hurtful, even if it's meant to be a retort. The author's friend might feel that their identity is being used as a weapon in the exchange, which could be more hurtful than a regular joke. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that both have discussed their struggles with identity. The author's friend's comment about the author's identity might have been a valid expression of their own feelings, but the author's response could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience by turning it back on them. \n\nEven if they usually tease each other, the line between teasing and being hurtful can be thin. The key here is whether the author's response was a fair retort or if it crossed into using the friend's identity in a harmful way. Since the friend was immediately offended and the author dismissed their reaction as being a \"baby,\" it suggests that the author didn't consider the potential impact of their words. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation involves mutual teasing, the author's response might have been inappropriate because it used the friend's transgender identity in a way that could be hurtful, especially given the sensitive nature of identity issues. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
