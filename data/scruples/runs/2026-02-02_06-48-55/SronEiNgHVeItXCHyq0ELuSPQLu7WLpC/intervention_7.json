I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a conversation with their transgender friend.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is ethnically Chinese and British, was told by their transgender friend that they aren't English and shouldn't pretend to be. The author responds with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender. The friend is offended, and the author thinks she's being sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and the friend have shared struggles related to identity. The author's friend is transitioning, which involves a personal journey of self-identification. The author's comment seems to draw a parallel between their own identity issues and the friend's transgender experience. However, comparing one's own identity struggles to someone else's gender identity might not be appropriate. \n\nThe author's response might come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if both are dealing with identity, the nature of those struggles is different. The friend was pointing out the author's ethnic identity, while the author's retort uses the friend's transgender status, which could be seen as a personal attack. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a fair or appropriate retort. The friend was making a point about the author's national identity, and the author countered with a comment about the friend's transgender status. This might be seen as deflecting from the original issue and bringing up a sensitive topic in a teasing manner, which could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship, which is described as teasing, the author might have thought it was in good fun. However, the friend's immediate reaction suggests that it was offensive. The author then dismisses the friend's reaction as being a \"baby,\" which shows a lack of empathy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, even if the author's intention was to highlight a parallel, the way it was done could be hurtful. The friend's transgender identity is a significant aspect of her self-identity, and using it in a confrontational manner during a discussion might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the author's comment, while perhaps intended as a witty retort, might have been an unfair comparison and could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
