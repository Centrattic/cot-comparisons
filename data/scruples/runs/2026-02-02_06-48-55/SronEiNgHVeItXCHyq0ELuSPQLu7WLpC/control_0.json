I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity.\n\nSo the situation: The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transgender (male to female). They have a teasing relationship. The friend called out the author for pretending to be English when they're Chinese. The author responded with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person,\" which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment seems to be about the author's identity, pointing out that they are Chinese, not English. The author's response is pointing out the hypocrisy, given the friend's own transition.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they've talked about each other's struggles. The friend's comment might have been a joke or a tease, but the author turned it into a serious point about hypocrisy. The problem here is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nTransgender individuals often face challenges related to their gender identity being recognized. Comparing the author's experience of cultural identity to the friend's gender identity transition might not be equivalent. The friend's identity is about gender, which is a different kind of identity than ethnicity or nationality. So the author's comment could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience by equating it with their own, perhaps in a flippant way.\n\nAlso, the author says they thought the friend was being a baby after the response. That suggests they didn't consider the friend's feelings, which could be seen as dismissive. The key here is whether using the friend's transgender identity as a retort was in poor taste, especially in a teasing context. Even if they have a teasing relationship, the joke might have crossed a line by bringing up the friend's transition in a way that could be hurtful.\n\nThe friend might have felt that the author was mocking their transition, even if it was meant as a joke. The author's response could be perceived as reducing the friend's experience to a punchline. Since both have discussed their struggles, the author might have known the sensitivity around the friend's identity, making the comment more hurtful.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong: The response was a direct and possibly hurtful jab at the friend's identity, using the friend's own experience against them. Even if the author thought it was a valid point, the way it was delivered without considering the friend's feelings could make them at fault. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
