I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a transgender friend being called out for questioning the author's national identity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is ethnically Chinese, born and raised in Britain, identifying as both British and Chinese. They mention that in their community, it was a sore subject not being seen as English/British. The friend, who is transgender (male to female), starts teasing the author about their national identity, saying they're not English but Chinese. The author responds with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender, which offends the friend.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and how the author's response might have been dismissive or invalidating. The author's friend was making a joke or a tease about their own identity, and the author retaliated by pointing out the friend's transgender status. The author later says they've discussed the difficulties of dual identity and gender transition. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics of friendship and respect. Even if the initial comment from the friend was a joke, the author's response might have been a form of retort that's not respectful. The friend's identity as transgender is a fundamental part of who they are, and using that as a counterpoint in a teasing manner could be seen as hurtful. The fact that the friend's smile disappeared and they were offended suggests the response was inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've discussed the struggles of identity with their friend. If the author has empathy for the friend's experiences, then using the friend's transgender status as a retort might contradict that empathy. It's possible the author didn't consider how that comment would land, even in the context of their teasing relationship.\n\nAnother angle: The friend's initial comment might have been a sensitive topic for the author, leading to a defensive reaction. However, responding with a comment about the friend's identity could be seen as attacking their very existence, which is more serious than the original joke. The author's defense is that they thought the friend was being a baby, but that doesn't justify the response.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using someone's identity in a negative way, even in a joking context, can be harmful. The author's response might have crossed a line by bringing up the friend's transgender status, which is a deeper and more sensitive issue than the original national identity comment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction, while perhaps intended as a witty retort, likely hurt the friend and invalidated their experiences. The author might not have considered the impact of their words, especially given their shared discussions about identity struggles. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
