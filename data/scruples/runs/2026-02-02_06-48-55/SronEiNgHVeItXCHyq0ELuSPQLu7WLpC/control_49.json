I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, and identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female. They have a teasing relationship. The friend criticized the author for pretending to be English, and the author responded with an ironic comment about the friend being transgender. The friend was offended, and the author wonders if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend questioned the author's national identity, which is a sensitive topic given their background. The author then used the friend's transgender identity to point out hypocrisy, which the friend took as offensive.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They mentioned they have a teasing relationship, so maybe the author thought the friend wouldn't take it seriously. However, the friend's reaction suggests that the comment crossed a line. Even if the friend brought up the national identity issue, using the friend's transgender status as a counterpoint might be seen as dismissive or invalidating of the friend's experiences. It's important to note that comparing different types of identity struggles isn't helpful and can be hurtful. The author's friend had shared her difficulties with transitioning, so the author might have known the sensitivity around that. By drawing a parallel in that way, the author could have unintentionally minimized the friend's experiences or made her feel dismissed. \n\nAlso, the author's response was a direct jab at the friend's identity, which can be particularly hurtful. Even if the author felt the friend was being \"a baby,\" that doesn't justify the response. The key here is the use of the friend's transgender identity as a retort, which might come across as an attack on her identity, even if it was meant to be ironic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to acknowledge others' identities and not to use them as a weapon, even in a teasing manner. The friend was already in a vulnerable position by bringing up the national identity topic, and the author's response could have been seen as a personal attack. The author might have intended it as a humorous or ironic response, but the context and the friend's reaction show that it was hurtful.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they used the friend's transgender identity in a way that caused offense, even if they thought it was a fair retort. The situation requires sensitivity, especially when dealing with others' identities and past struggles.\n"
