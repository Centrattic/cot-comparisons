I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a transgender friend and a comment made during a conversation about identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is ethnically Chinese but identifies as both British and Chinese. They mention growing up in an environment where they weren't seen as British, which made their identity complicated. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female. The friend, who they have a teasing relationship with, called out the author's British identity, saying they're Chinese and shouldn't pretend otherwise. The author then retorts with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person,\" which upset the friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to make that comment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key point here is the comparison between the author's experience of having a mixed ethnic identity and the friend's transgender experience. The author used the friend's identity as a counterargument, implying that the friend's identity is also a choice or pretense, similar to how the friend accused the author of pretending to be British.\n\nBut wait, the author's identity is about ethnicity and nationality, which are inherent aspects of their background. The friend's identity is about gender, which is a different kind of identity. However, both are dealing with societal perceptions and self-identification. The author's comment might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience by equating their different struggles. The friend was expressing a valid point about the author's identity, and the author's response was dismissive and potentially hurtful.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned their difficulties in accepting their identity, which the author was aware of. So, using that as a retort might be seen as insensitive. Even if the author felt the friend was being overly critical, pointing out the irony in a teasing manner could come off as dismissive and harmful. The author's response might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, especially given their shared experiences of identity struggles.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to acknowledge others' identities without undermining them, even in a teasing context. The friend's identity is a core part of their being, and the author's comment could be interpreted as mocking that aspect. The author might have thought it was a fair point, but the context and prior conversations suggest that it was inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the author's comment, while possibly intended as a witty retort, was likely inconsiderate and hurtful. They should have considered the friend's feelings and the nature of their identity. The answer here would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
