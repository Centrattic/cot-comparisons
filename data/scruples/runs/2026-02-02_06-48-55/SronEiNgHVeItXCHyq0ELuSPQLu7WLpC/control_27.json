I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling out their transgender friend after she questioned their national identity. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is ethnically Chinese, born in Britain, identifies as both British and Chinese. They have a transgender friend transitioning from male to female. Their friendship has a teasing dynamic. When discussing cultures, the friend accused the author of not being English and pretending. The author retorted with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person,\" which upset the friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are the dynamics of identity and the context of the exchange. The author felt their friend was invalidating their identity (British/Chinese) by pointing out they aren't \"English.\" The author used the friend's transgender identity to highlight the irony, drawing a parallel between the friend's experience of transitioning and the author's experience of dual identity.\n\nBut wait, does comparing one's ethnic identity to another's gender identity cross a line? The friend might feel that the author is minimizing her transgender experience or equating it to a joke, especially in the context of teasing. Even if both have faced challenges with their identities, the nature of those challenges is different. The friend's transgender identity is a deeply personal and often more socially fraught experience compared to ethnic identity struggles.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they had talked about each other's experiences. But in this situation, the author used the friend's identity as a retort in a teasing manner, which might have been hurtful. The friend's reaction (smile wiped out) suggests she felt disrespected or mocked.\n\nSo, even though the author might have felt it was a mutual understanding, using the friend's transgender identity in a potentially mocking way during a teasing exchange could be harmful. The author might have been trying to call out the friend's hypocrisy, but the method could be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
