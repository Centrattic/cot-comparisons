I learned to live with it, so no worries there.\n\nI have a transgender friend who is transitioning from a man to a woman. She and I have bit of a teasing relationship - we take shots at each other.\n\nSo last night, she starts taking shots at me when we were talking about cultures. I said something about how difficult it is to be English in some countries, and she said \"you're not English though. You're Chinese. Stop pretending to be something you're not.\"\n\nAnd I immediately shot back with \"ironic, coming from a transgender person.\"\n\nHer smile immediately wiped out. I could tell she was offended, but I thought she was being a baby.\n\nI have talked to her about how strange and difficult it was for me growing up with two national identities, not really belonging to either. She, too, has talked to me about how difficult it was for her to accept she is a woman.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a transgender friend being called out for questioning the author's national identity.\n\nThe author is ethnically Chinese in Britain and identifies as both British and Chinese. Their friend is transitioning and they have a teasing relationship. The friend comments on the author not being English, so the author responds with an \"ironic\" remark referencing the friend's transgender identity. The friend is offended, but the author thinks they're being a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has talked about their struggles with dual identity, and the friend has shared her own challenges. The friend's comment was a jab at the author's national identity, which the author then counters with a jab about the friend's gender identity.\n\nIs it okay to make a joke about someone's gender identity in a teasing context? Transgender issues are sensitive, and even if the author and friend usually tease each other, the line between friendly teasing and being hurtful can be thin. The friend's transition is a significant part of her identity, so comparing it to the author's national identity might be seen as minimizing her struggles. The author's response could come off as dismissive or insensitive, especially if the friend felt targeted for her identity.\n\nThe author mentions that they both have discussed their difficulties, but bringing up the transgender aspect in a retort during a conflict might not be the best approach. Even if the intention was to point out the hypocrisy, the way it's phrased could be hurtful. The friend's smile disappearing and feeling offended suggests that the comment crossed a line.\n\nSo, considering the potential insensitivity of the remark and the context of their relationship, the author might be in the wrong. They could have addressed the friend's comment without referencing her transgender identity in a way that might be seen as mocking or invalidating her experience.\n"
