I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question has a criminal past, served time, and is now trying to rebuild their life. They have tattoos that make people judge them. Their girlfriend's brother is making disrespectful comments about their appearance and past. The brother asks if they killed anyone and makes a joke comparing them to a movie villain. The author responds by telling the brother not to be a smartass and to watch how they speak, which they frame as a warning rather than a threat.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's comments are definitely stereotyping and rude. The author's response was to warn the brother, not to threaten. However, the way they communicated that warning might come off as aggressive. The girlfriend is upset because she perceives it as threatening. But the author's intent was to stop the disrespectful behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the brother's comments are disrespectful. On the other hand, the way the author responded might not be the best approach. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe addressing the issue with the girlfriend first or setting boundaries calmly. The brother's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might have escalated the situation. However, the author is defending their dignity after months of being judged. It's a tricky balance between standing up for oneself and handling it in a way that doesn't cause further conflict. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be questioned. But the key here is whether they actually crossed the line into threatening behavior. Since they said \"I told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me,\" it's more of a warning rather than a threat. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're defending themselves from ongoing disrespect.\n"
