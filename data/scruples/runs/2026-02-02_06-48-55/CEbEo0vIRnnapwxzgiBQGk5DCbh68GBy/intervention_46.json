I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the person having a criminal past, tattoos, and now in a relationship with a girl whose family is judging him. The brother makes a stereotype-laden comment, and the author responds by telling the brother to not be a smart ass and to watch his words. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it was a threat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author served time and has tattoos, which others might use to stereotype him. The brother's comments are clearly offensive, implying that the author is a criminal or dangerous. The author's response is defensive. The question is whether the response was appropriate.\n\nThe author says he doesn't make threats but gives warnings. The brother's behavior was disrespectful. The author might feel that the family has been judging him for months, so this was a breaking point. However, the way he responded could have been perceived as a threat, even if he intended it as a warning. The girlfriend's reaction is important here because she's upset about the potential threat to her brother.\n\nOn one hand, the brother's comments were stereotyping and dismissive. The author has a right to express discomfort. On the other hand, the wording \"watch how you speak to other men who might not be as understanding as me\" could be seen as a threat, implying that others might not respond as calmly. The line between a warning and a threat can be thin here. The author might not have intended harm, but the message could be interpreted as threatening, especially in a tense situation.\n\nAlso, the author's history with prison might make him more sensitive to being judged. However, the way he responded could escalate the conflict rather than de-escalate it. The girlfriend's family's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might not be the best approach to address it. Perhaps a more constructive way would be to talk to the girlfriend about the family's behavior rather than confronting the brother directly in such a way.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's intention was to set a boundary, but the method might have been inappropriate. The response could be seen as a threat, which justifies the girlfriend's anger. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
