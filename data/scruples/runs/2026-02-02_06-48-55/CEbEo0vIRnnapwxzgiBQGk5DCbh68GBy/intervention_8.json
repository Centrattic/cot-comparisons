I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a criminal record, served time, and now has tattoos. His girlfriend's brother is making stereotypical comments about him, implying he might be dangerous or a killer. The author responds by telling the brother not to be a smart aleck and to watch how he speaks, which the girlfriend interprets as threatening. She's upset because her family is already judgmental, and now the author took a stand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a vulnerable position, having served time and trying to reintegrate into society. The brother's comments are stereotyping based on appearance, which is unfair. The author's response was a direct warning, which he says isn't a threat but a warning. The key here is the intent and the perception. The author might feel that the brother's words were disrespectful, especially since the family has been judgmental before. However, the way he responded might come off as aggressive or threatening, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author confronted her brother, which could have escalated tensions. Family dynamics are tricky, especially when there's existing tension. The author might feel justified in standing up for himself, but the method could be problematic. The brother's behavior was inappropriate, but the author's reaction might not have been the best approach. Maybe a different way to handle the situation, like discussing it with the girlfriend first or addressing it calmly, would have been better.\n\nAlso, the author's history might make him more sensitive to being judged. However, reacting in a way that's perceived as threatening could harm his relationship with the girlfriend and her family. The question is whether the author overstepped by directly confronting the brother instead of seeking a more peaceful resolution. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible the author wasn't in the wrong because he was defending himself against stereotyping. But the method he used might be seen as the wrong approach. The answer hinges on whether the warning is considered a justified self-defense of one's dignity or an unnecessary confrontation.\n"
