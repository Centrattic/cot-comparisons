I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author, who has a criminal past and visible tattoos, dealing with the judgment from their girlfriend's family. The brother made a comment implying the author might have committed a violent crime, and the author responded by telling the brother to watch his language.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has already served time and is trying to rebuild their life. The brother's question about whether he killed someone is pretty direct and could come off as rude or insensitive. The author's response was to tell the brother not to be a smart aleck and to watch how he speaks. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the author threatened her brother, but the author claims it was a warning, not a threat.\n\nNow, the key points here. The brother's comments are stereotyping based on the author's appearance. That's definitely disrespectful. The author's reaction is to set a boundary, perhaps due to past experiences of being judged. However, the line between a warning and a threat can be thin. If the author's tone was confrontational or implied harm, that could be seen as a threat. But if it was simply stating that the brother's words are inappropriate and that others might not take it as well, it's more of a warning.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important too. She's upset that the author didn't respect her brother, even if the brother was being disrespectful. The author might be in the wrong if their response was aggressive or crossed into threatening behavior, which could escalate tensions. On the other hand, standing up for oneself against disrespectful comments is valid. But the method matters. The author might have handled it better by addressing the issue without confrontation, maybe discussing it with the girlfriend first instead of directly confronting her brother.\n\nAlso, the author's history means they might be more sensitive to such comments. However, responding in a way that could be perceived as a threat might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's intention was to set a boundary, but the brother perceived it as a threat. The girlfriend's anger comes from feeling that the author attacked her family, which is a valid concern because it could strain their relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's comments were definitely inappropriate. The author's response, while understandable, might have been the wrong approach. Threats, even if meant as warnings, can be taken the wrong way and may not resolve the underlying issue. The author could have addressed the disrespect more constructively, perhaps by talking to the girlfriend about the family's behavior instead of confronting the brother directly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as in the wrong because their response could be interpreted as threatening, even if their intention was to set a boundary. The key here is whether the response contributed to a respectful resolution or exacerbated the conflict. Since the girlfriend is now upset and the author's method of confrontation might have been aggressive, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
