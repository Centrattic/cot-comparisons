I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for warning their girlfriend's brother after the brother made a stereotype-based comment about him. The author has a criminal history due to serving seven years in prison and has tattoos, which the brother used to mock him by asking if he killed anyone and comparing him to a movie villain.\n\nFirst, the brother's behavior seems disrespectful and judgmental. The author mentions that the family has been disrespectful for months, but this was the first time he gave a warning. The key here is whether the brother's comment was a legitimate question or a sneer. If the brother was mocking him, then the author's response might be justified.\n\nThe author says he told the brother to \"watch how he speaks\" because others might not be as understanding. This is a warning, not a threat. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks it's a threat. But the author clarifies he doesn't make threats, only warnings. \n\nNow, considering the context: the brother was being disrespectful, and the author, who has served his time, is standing up for himself. The author's response might be seen as self-defense in terms of setting boundaries. However, the way he communicated it could have come across as threatening, which might explain why the girlfriend is upset. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother was being rude, the author's warning is a reasonable response to put a stop to the disrespect. The author isn't escalating the situation beyond a warning. The family's judgment isn't justified based on the author's past, and the brother's comments were likely meant to provoke. \n\nSo, the author's actions are in self-defense against being stereotyped and mocked. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
