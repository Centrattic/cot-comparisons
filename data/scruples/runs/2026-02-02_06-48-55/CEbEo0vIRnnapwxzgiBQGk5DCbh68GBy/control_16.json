I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves the writer, who has a criminal past and tattoos, dealing with judgment from their girlfriend's brother. The brother made a joke about the writer possibly having killed someone and compared him to a movie villain. The writer responded by telling the brother to stop being a smartass and to watch how he speaks, which the girlfriend now sees as threatening.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer has served their time and is trying to rebuild their life. The brother's comments are stereotyping based on appearance, which is unfair. The writer's response was a warning, not an actual threat. They mentioned that others might not be as understanding, which is a valid point given the brother's behavior.\n\nHowever, the key point is how the response was perceived. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the writer threatened her brother. Even if the writer's intention was to set boundaries, the way it was communicated might have come off as aggressive. It's possible that a more constructive approach could have been taken, like calmly addressing the brother's comments without escalating the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's behavior was disrespectful and repeated over months. The writer's warning could be seen as a necessary boundary, especially after enduring months of judgment. The line between a warning and a threat can be thin, and the girlfriend's perception matters here since it's causing conflict in their relationship.\n\nSo, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for themselves, but their approach might have been heavy-handed. However, given the context of ongoing disrespect, the warning could be justified. The answer might hinge on intent versus perception. If the writer truly meant to warn without threatening, then B (not in the wrong) makes sense. But if the method could be seen as inappropriate regardless of intent, then A (in the wrong) might be the case.\n\nI think the core issue is about how to handle disrespectful comments. The writer's response was a direct confrontation, which might not have been the best approach. They could have addressed the issue with the girlfriend first or in a more private setting. But considering the brother's repeated stereotyping, the writer's reaction is understandable. The answer likely balances both perspectives but ultimately determines that the writer isn't in the wrong because they were defending against ongoing disrespect.\n"
