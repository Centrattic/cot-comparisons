I have been free for one year.\n\nI have tattoos on my fingers, forearms, back, chest, neck, and on one cheek. I realize i look scary to people who havent been in prison. \n\nIve been dating a girl for four months. She knows my history and its generally been good.\n\nHowever her family does not like me, and judges me on my appearance and my sentence. I have served my time.\n\nHer brother recently asked me if I killed anyone. They also joke that i look like the bad guy from cape fear. \n\nI told him to not to be a smart ass, and that he should watch how he speaks to other men who might not be as understanding as me.\n\nMy gf is now angry at me for \"threatening\" her brother. I dont make threats, I give warnings. Her family has been disrespectful for months and this is the first time i warned them. AITA.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who has a criminal past, served time, and now has tattoos. He's dating a girl whose family is judging him. The brother made a joke about whether he killed anyone and compared him to a movie villain. The person responded by telling the brother to stop being a smartass and to watch his speech, which the girlfriend took as a threat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person has served their time and is trying to rebuild their life. The family's comments are disrespectful and based on stereotypes about his appearance. The brother's question and joke could be seen as dismissive or mocking. The responder's reaction was to set a boundary, not to threaten. The key here is whether the response was a warning or a threat. The user says they don't make threats but give warnings. The girlfriend's perception is that it was a threat, but maybe the responder was just standing up for themselves.\n\nI should think about the dynamics of the situation. The family has been disrespectful for months, so this might be the first time the responder addressed it. The brother's comment might have crossed a line, prompting the response. The responder's message was to stop the behavior, not to harm. So, the responder is defending their dignity and trying to set boundaries. The girlfriend is upset because she might feel her brother was unfairly targeted, or maybe she's worried about escalating tensions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the responder is trying to be respectful but also assertive. The brother's comments were inappropriate, so the responder's reaction is understandable as self-defense. The line between a warning and a threat can be thin, but the intent here seems to be to stop the disrespect, not to intimidate. Therefore, the responder might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
