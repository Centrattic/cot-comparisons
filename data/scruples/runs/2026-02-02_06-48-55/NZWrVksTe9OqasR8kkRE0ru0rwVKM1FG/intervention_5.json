My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for my opinion on whether the author (AITA) is at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014driving drunk with her sister, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs, and other dangerous choices. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and decided to address directly by saying, \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" Now, the sister hasn't contacted the author since, and the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking another perspective. So, I need to weigh both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned for their sister's safety and has valid reasons to be worried about the boyfriend's behavior. However, the author hasn't communicated these concerns to the sister yet. Instead, they addressed the boyfriend directly about being called family, which might have come across as harsh or dismissive. The boyfriend was probably trying to build a relationship with the author's family, which is common when someone is dating a sister. But the author's response could be seen as cutting off that interaction abruptly, potentially hurting the sister's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are indeed concerning, and the author might feel that by letting the boyfriend get too close, it could lead to more problems. The author might have felt that clarifying the relationship dynamics was necessary to prevent the boyfriend from assuming a familial role, which the author isn't comfortable with.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points to consider are whether the author's approach was appropriate. Directly telling the boyfriend he's not family might be seen as a boundary, but perhaps it could have been handled more sensitively. The author didn't confront the sister first about the boyfriend's behavior, which might be a better approach. Instead, they addressed the boyfriend directly, which could have been perceived as hostile without the sister's input.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted in a way that respects others' autonomy while also acting in their own best interests. The author did act out of concern for their sister, but the method might have been off. The author's sister might feel that her partner is being unfairly judged by her sibling, leading to the breakdown in communication. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handled the situation.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author had valid concerns and was setting boundaries. However, the approach could have been better, but that doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that the author should have discussed concerns with the sister first. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the specific action of telling the boyfriend he's not family. Since the author's intention was to set boundaries and the action itself, while direct, wasn't inherently wrong, the answer might be B.\n"
