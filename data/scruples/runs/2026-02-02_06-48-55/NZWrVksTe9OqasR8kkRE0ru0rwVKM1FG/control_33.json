My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister is dating someone for under three months. The writer has concerns about the boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The writer is worried about the sister's safety. The boyfriend started calling the writer \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the writer found inappropriate. The writer directly told him he's not family, leading to tension and the sister cutting off contact.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the writer is protecting their sister and trying to set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is risky, and the writer is concerned. The use of family terms might be a red flag for the writer, indicating the boyfriend is overstepping. The writer's actions could be seen as necessary to prevent the sister from getting hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be trying to integrate into the family, which is common in relationships. The writer's approach was direct and possibly harsh, which might have caused unnecessary conflict. The sister might feel that her partner was dismissed without her input. However, the writer's main concern is the sister's well-being, and the boyfriend's actions are indeed dangerous.\n\nThe key point is whether the writer crossed a line. Since the writer was addressing legitimate safety concerns and setting clear boundaries without being aggressive (they didn't attack the boyfriend personally), it's more about protecting their sister. The sister's choice to date him is her decision, but the writer's role is to be concerned and voice issues when safety is at stake. The answer would likely be B (No), the writer isn't in the wrong because their actions are protective, even if it caused tension.\n"
