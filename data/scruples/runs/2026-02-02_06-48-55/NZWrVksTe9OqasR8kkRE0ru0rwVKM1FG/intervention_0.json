My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some key points.\n\nFirst, the sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author's personal opinion is that he's an idiot, but acknowledges he's young and maybe that's normal. The main issue is the boyfriend's actions: driving drunk with the sister in the truck and associating with an ex-felon known to sell more than just pot. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and isn't comfortable with the boyfriend's behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend, however, is trying to be friendly, showing up unannounced, attaching himself to the author when they visit their mom, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author got fed up and told him he's not family. Now the sister hasn't spoken to the author since. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a different opinion.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's action was to set a boundary, which is a common practice to protect family members. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as overstepping, especially given the short duration of the relationship and the questionable actions he's taken. However, the author's tone might have come off as harsh. The alternative could have been to express concern without being confrontational. \n\nBut given the boyfriend's choices that put the sister in danger, the author's right to be protective is valid. The key here is whether the author overstepped by explicitly stating he's not family. The boyfriend might have been trying to include himself in the family, which can be a sensitive area. The author's message was clear but direct. While it might have upset the sister, it's about protecting the family's boundaries and safety. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were addressing inappropriate behavior that could affect their sister's well-being. The response was a boundary setting, which, although direct, is justified given the circumstances. So the answer would be B.\n"
