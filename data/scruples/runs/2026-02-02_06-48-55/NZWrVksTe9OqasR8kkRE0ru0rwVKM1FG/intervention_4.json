My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about his sister's safety due to the boyfriend's reckless behavior\u2014drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept his opinions to himself until now but felt compelled to address the boyfriend's attempts to befriend him and call him \"brother\" and \"fam.\"\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's actions that put the sister at risk and the author's response to his overstepping. The author's intention was to set boundaries, which is understandable given the situation. However, the question is whether the method he used was appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend showed up uninvited at the author's apartment and was overly familiar, which the author found annoying. When the author finally addressed it, he told the boyfriend he wasn't family, which might have come off as harsh. But considering the boyfriend's behavior and the author's valid concerns for his sister's safety, this could be seen as a necessary boundary.\n\nThe sister hasn't responded since, but the author's main issue was with the boyfriend's actions. The author's actions were a direct response to the boyfriend's encroachment on personal space and the potential danger he poses. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author did confront the boyfriend directly, but maybe there was a better way to handle it without being so confrontational. However, given the circumstances, the author's intent was protective. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he was setting boundaries for safety reasons.\n"
