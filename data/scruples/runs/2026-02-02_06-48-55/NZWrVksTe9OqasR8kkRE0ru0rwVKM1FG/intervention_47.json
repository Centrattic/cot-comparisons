My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy because of some dangerous behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned but kept it to himself until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told him he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The author's main concern is the safety of his sister. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author is trying to protect her. But he kept his opinions to himself initially, which is respecting his sister's choice. Then the issue becomes the boyfriend's encroachment into the author's personal space, showing up uninvited, and being overly familiar. The author's statement was a boundary-setting moment. \n\nIs it wrong to set that boundary? Well, the boyfriend might have thought he was being friendly and part of the family, but the author felt it was inappropriate given the short time and the boyfriend's behavior. The author's message was clear but direct. However, maybe there was a better way to address it without being so blunt. For example, talking to the sister first about his concerns about the boyfriend's behavior before confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nBy confronting the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister, the author might have overstepped. The sister is the one in the relationship, so her opinion and boundaries should matter more. The author's actions might have caused tension between him and his sister because he didn't consult her first. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to protect his sister and set boundaries, the method might have been too direct and disrespectful to her autonomy. The boyfriend's actions might have been pushing the author's limits, but perhaps the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his sister before confronting the boyfriend, which could have led to unnecessary conflict. However, his concerns about safety are valid. It's a tricky situation where both sides have points, but the approach taken might have been too abrupt.\n"
