My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The user provided a Reddit-style story where the author tells their sister's boyfriend he's not family after some incidents.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior: drunk driving with his sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon, and the boyfriend trying to get close to the author by calling him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author confronts him by saying he's not family, leading to the sister not speaking to them.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider the key points. The author's sister is in a relationship, so the boyfriend is her partner. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's actions that put her sister at risk. However, the author's approach was direct and possibly confrontational.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author's intention is to protect their sister, which is understandable. But the method of confronting the boyfriend might be seen as harsh. The author acknowledges the boyfriend is just trying to be friendly, but the incidents (drunk driving, associating with a felon) are serious. The author's statement \"You're not my family\" could be perceived as dismissive or rude, even if the concern is valid.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, so the author's concern is valid. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in their sister's best interest. But the way they handled it could be problematic. The sister's reaction (not contacting them) suggests the confrontation might have been too abrupt.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a valid reason to be concerned. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author's intervention is justified. However, the approach could have been more constructive, like talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But since the author kept their opinions to themselves until now, they might feel it's time to act.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are good, but the method could be questioned. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the concern is legitimate, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
