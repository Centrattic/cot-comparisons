My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's behavior: he was drunk driving with her in the car and took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about the boyfriend's influence on their sister. They kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend was acting overly familiar, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told him he's not family. Now the sister hasn't responded, so the author is worried about the fallout.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns about the boyfriend's actions. The boyfriend's behavior is risky and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is understandable. Also, the boyfriend's attempts to bond might come off as intrusive, especially if the author isn't comfortable with it. The author might feel that setting boundaries is necessary here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author directly told the boyfriend he's not family. That might have been harsh. Maybe there's a better way to set boundaries without making the person feel rejected. Also, since the sister is the one in a relationship, the author should respect her choice, even if they disagree. Confronting the boyfriend in that way might have upset the sister, leading to the communication breakdown.\n\nBut given the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, maybe the author had a right to express their concerns. The key issue is whether the method was appropriate. The author chose to be blunt, which might have been necessary given the circumstances. However, maybe they should have discussed it with the sister first or approached the boyfriend more gently.\n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their sister and setting personal boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so it's valid to express disapproval. The term \"brother\" and \"fam\" could be seen as overstepping, especially when the author isn't comfortable with that level of familiarity.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. The author's concerns are valid, but the way they expressed it might be the issue. However, given the boyfriend's risky behavior, the author might have a right to draw a line. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), as they're protecting their sister and setting boundaries. However, the method could have been more diplomatic. But in the end, the author isn't the one in the relationship, so their role is to be a concerned sibling. Therefore, maybe they aren't in the wrong.\n"
