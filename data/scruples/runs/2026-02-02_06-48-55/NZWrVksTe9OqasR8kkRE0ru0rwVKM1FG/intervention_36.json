My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating the guy for under three months. The author has a lot of issues with him\u2014like the drunk driving accident and the bad influence with the ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and using \"family\" terms. The author then told him he's not family, which upset the sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions versus their intentions. The boyfriend's behavior was concerning, and the author had valid concerns about safety. But the direct confrontation might have come off as harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their sister and setting boundaries, which is understandable. They have a right to be cautious, especially given the dangerous situations the boyfriend put her in. The boyfriend's attempts to bond might have been overstepping, and the author felt the need to correct that.\n\nOn the other hand, the way the author delivered the message could be seen as abrupt or dismissive. The sister might feel that her partner is being attacked, even if the author's intentions were to protect. The sister's lack of communication after the incident suggests that the author's approach might have caused unnecessary tension in the family. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the boyfriend's actions were risky and the author's concern for their sister's safety\u2014it's possible that the author was just trying to set boundaries. The main issue here is whether the method was appropriate. However, given the boyfriend's behavior, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They were addressing a problem, even if the delivery was harsh. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because the underlying issues are valid, and the author was trying to protect their sister and set clear boundaries.\n"
