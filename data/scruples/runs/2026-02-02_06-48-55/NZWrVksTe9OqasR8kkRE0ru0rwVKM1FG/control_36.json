My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is dating someone who's made some questionable decisions\u2014drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned but has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then confronted him, leading to a strained relationship with their sister.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, the boyfriend's attempts to bond with the family, and the author's response to that.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has valid safety concerns for their sister. The boyfriend's actions could be dangerous. The author is within their rights to be concerned and want to protect their sister. However, the author acknowledges that the sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The way the author addressed the boyfriend might have been abrupt. The confrontation could have been handled more diplomatically to avoid hurting their sister's feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend probably felt he was being friendly and trying to integrate into the family, which is common for partners. The author's response of \"You're not my family\" might have come off as harsh, even if the intention was to set boundaries. It's possible that a more indirect approach, like talking to the sister first, would have been better.\n\nHowever, the author isn't obligated to be close with the boyfriend. It's their choice how they interact. The main issue is whether the author overstepped. Since the author didn't directly interfere with the relationship but set a personal boundary, they might not be in the wrong. But the way it was done might not be the best approach.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary, especially given the safety concerns. The answer is B.\n"
