My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has personal issues with the guy, like thinking he's an idiot and making dangerous choices\u2014drunk driving with his sister in the car, exposing her to an ex-felon who sells drugs. These are serious concerns. The author is worried about their sister's safety and the guy's influence on her.\n\nNow, the author kept their opinions to themselves until now. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited, and being overly friendly. The author feels this is crossing a boundary, so they confront him by saying he's not family but the guy who's dating their sister.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the context. The author isn't trying to be rude for no reason; there's a valid concern about the boyfriend's behavior. The confrontation happens because the boyfriend is overstepping by trying to be part of the family. The author's statement is direct but might come off as harsh, especially since the sister might feel her partner is being disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author's actions are rooted in trying to protect their sister and set clear boundaries. Even though they might have upset the sister, their intention was to correct the boyfriend's mistaken assumption of closeness. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposing sister to danger) are red flags that the author is rightly concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't approach the sister first to express these concerns. They went straight to the boyfriend, which might have been a more direct approach but could have been handled more tactfully. The sister might feel her choice in partner is being judged, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while perhaps impulsive, are driven by protective instincts. The boyfriend's behavior was concerning, and the author was asserting boundaries to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
