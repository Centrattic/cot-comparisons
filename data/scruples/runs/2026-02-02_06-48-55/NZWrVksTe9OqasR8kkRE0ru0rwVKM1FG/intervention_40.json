My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation involves the author's sister dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then directly told him he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main issue is with the boyfriend's actions that could harm their sister. However, the author has stayed silent until now, respecting their sister's choice. The confrontation happened when the boyfriend overstepped by being too familiar, leading the author to set a boundary. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? Well, the sister is an adult, so she can choose who to date. But the author is concerned about her safety. However, the way the author addressed it was direct and possibly harsh. Telling someone they're not family might come off as dismissive or hurtful, even if the author's intentions were protective. The key here is whether the method was appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend was trying to be friendly and integrate into the sister's family, which is common in relationships. By calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" he might have been trying to build a bond, but the author felt it was overstepping. The author's response was blunt, which could have been done more gently. Maybe a private conversation without the confrontational tone would have been better. \n\nAlso, considering the sister's reaction\u2014she hasn't contacted the author since\u2014there's a possibility that the author's message hurt her feelings or made her defensive about her partner. The author's actions might have interfered in her relationship, even if with good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior. The drunk driving and association with a dangerous person are serious issues. But the author chose to address the boundary issue rather than the dangerous behavior. Maybe they should have focused on discussing the boyfriend's actions with their sister instead of confronting him directly. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author overstepped. The author did have the right to set a boundary in their own relationship with the boyfriend, but the approach might have been too harsh. The key point is that the sister is the one in the relationship and should make decisions about her partner. The author's interference might have been a breach of that autonomy, even if well-meaning.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to protect their sister, the method of confrontation\u2014publicly or directly telling the boyfriend he's not family\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their concerns were valid.\n"
