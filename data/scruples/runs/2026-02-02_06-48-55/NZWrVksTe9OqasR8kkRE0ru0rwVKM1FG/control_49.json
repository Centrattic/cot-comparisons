My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The key points to consider are the context of the relationship, the author's intentions, and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014he's young, made dangerous choices like drunk driving with her sister in the truck, and took her to meet a known ex-felon. These are serious issues that could impact the sister's safety. The author is worried but has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe boyfriend started showing up at the author's apartment and being overly familiar, using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt this was overstepping and decided to confront him directly, stating he's not family. The boyfriend responded calmly, and the author hasn't heard from the sister since.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, consider if the author acted appropriately given the context. The author's actions were to set boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's risky behavior. Even though the author respects the sister's choice in partners, the boyfriend's actions are concerning. The author might be trying to protect their sister and clarify where they stand to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too close. \n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by being confrontational in front of the sister or without discussing it with her first, potentially causing tension. But the boyfriend's behavior was indeed intrusive, and the author had the right to express discomfort with the familiarity. \n\nIn many cases, family members have the right to voice concerns, especially about safety. The author's actions could be seen as protective rather than hostile. The key here is that the author addressed the issue when the brother-in-law was crossing personal boundaries, which might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author's actions were a response to the boyfriend's overstepping and potential danger to their sister. They had the right to set boundaries, even if it caused some conflict.\n"
