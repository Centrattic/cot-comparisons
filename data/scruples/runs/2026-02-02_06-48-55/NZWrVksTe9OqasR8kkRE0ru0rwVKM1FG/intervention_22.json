My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author has some issues with the boyfriend: he's young, made dangerous choices (like drunk driving with the sister in the car, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs, etc.). The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the author's motivations, the boyfriend's behavior, and the potential consequences.\n\nThe author's main concern is for their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to obtain drugs\u2014are serious issues. Even though the author has kept their opinions to themselves, the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag. \n\nHowever, the author's choice to confront the boyfriend by saying he's not family might come off as harsh. The boyfriend might have thought he was trying to bond with the family, which is common in relationships. The author's statement could be seen as dismissive or cutting, potentially causing a rift with the sister. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is protecting their sister. They have a right to express their concerns about the boyfriend's behavior. The line in the sand here is that the author is standing up for their sister's safety, which is a valid reason. However, the way they did it might have been abrupt. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong in making that statement. On one hand, the author had a valid reason to be concerned about their sister's safety. On the other hand, the approach might have been too direct and could have been done in a more constructive way, like talking to the sister first or involving the sister in the conversation. \n\nBut the author did keep their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend was being overly familiar, which might have been the last straw. The author's statement was a way to set boundaries. So, depending on the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to protect their sister. However, the method could have been better. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the method. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was justified. If the author's primary concern is their sister's safety and they are trying to set boundaries with someone they don't trust, even if the approach was blunt, they might not be in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic, so the author's intervention could be seen as necessary. \n\nBut some might argue that the author overstepped by not going through the sister first. However, the sister might not be receptive to criticism about her partner, so the author might have felt that direct action was necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method could have been smoother, the intention was to protect their sister, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
