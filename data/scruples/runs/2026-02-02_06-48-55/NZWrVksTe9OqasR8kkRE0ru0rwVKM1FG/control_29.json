My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the boyfriend's questionable behavior and the author's response to his attempts to be close.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: he's young, made dangerous decisions like drunk driving with the sister, and exposed her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned for their sister's safety, which is valid. Despite that, the author hasn't intervened directly but has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found uncomfortable. The author then directly told him he's not family. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, possibly upset about the confrontation.\n\nNow, considering boundaries: the author has a right to set personal boundaries, especially regarding family relationships. However, the sister is an adult and chooses who she dates, so the author shouldn't overstep unless there's immediate danger. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) do pose risks, so the author's concern is justified.\n\nThe problem might be the approach. Telling the boyfriend he's not family could come off as harsh, especially in front of the sister. It might have caused tension without resolving the underlying issues. The author might have needed to talk to the sister privately first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. However, given the potential dangers, the author's intention to protect their sister is understandable. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. The answer depends on whether the method used was appropriate. Since the boyfriend's behavior was risky, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary boundary to prevent closer ties that might endanger their sister. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
