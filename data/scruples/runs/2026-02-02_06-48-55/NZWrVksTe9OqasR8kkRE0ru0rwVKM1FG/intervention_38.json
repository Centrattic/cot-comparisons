My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their sister has a new boyfriend, and they don't like him because of some dangerous behavior\u2014like driving drunk with her sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The writer has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend has been coming over, acting like part of the family, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The writer finally told him he's not family, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the writer's actions. They confronted the boyfriend directly, which could be seen as crossing a line, but maybe they felt it necessary because of the risks involved. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, but the sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The writer might have thought they needed to protect their sister, but maybe they should have discussed this with her first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014being overly familiar and trying to integrate into the family without boundaries\u2014could make the writer feel uncomfortable. The direct confrontation might have been harsh, but it's also a way to set a boundary. The question is whether the writer's approach was appropriate. \n\nThe writer might not be in the wrong because they had valid concerns about their sister's safety. However, the method of confronting the boyfriend without involving the sister first could have been a mistake. The sister's reaction (not talking to the writer) suggests that the approach might have been too abrupt. \n\nSo, considering the context: the writer had good intentions but might have handled it in a way that alienated their sister. The key points are the sister's autonomy in relationships versus the writer's attempt to protect her. The writer's action was a boundary-setting move, but maybe the timing or method was off. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the sister chose to date this person despite the risks, the writer's direct confrontation without her input could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong for not involving the sister first. But others might argue it's a valid way to protect her. I'm torn, but I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't go through the sister first, which might have been a better approach.\n"
