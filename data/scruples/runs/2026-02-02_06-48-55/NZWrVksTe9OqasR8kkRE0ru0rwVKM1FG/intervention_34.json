My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's the sister's brother, told her boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating him for less than three months.\n\nThe author's main issues are that the boyfriend is young, made some dangerous choices (drunk driving with her sister and hanging out with a scary ex-felon). The author kept his opinions to himself until the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author took as being too close. So he told him he's not family but the guy the sister is dating now. Then the sister hasn't talked to him since.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's concern is valid because the boyfriend's actions are risky. But the author might have gone about it the wrong way. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but maybe not.\n\nFirst, the author has a right to be protective of his sister. The boyfriend's behavior is dangerous. But confronting the boyfriend directly like that could be seen as rude or overstepping. The author could have discussed it with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend was getting too close to the family, calling the author \"brother,\" which the author found annoying. The author might have felt the need to set boundaries. But doing it in a public or abrupt way could have caused more harm. The sister's reaction is a point here\u2014if the sister is upset, maybe the author shouldn't have done it without talking to her first.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend is not a family member, so the author's correction is technically true, but maybe the way it was said was harsh. The author's intent was to set boundaries, but the method might have been poor. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having a private conversation with the boyfriend to set limits without the confrontational remark.\n\nAlso, considering the short duration of the relationship, the author might be overreacting. But given the dangerous behavior, maybe not. The key is whether the author had the right to intervene without the sister's consent. Since the sister is an adult and making her own choices, the author shouldn't have taken it upon himself to confront the boyfriend directly. He should have discussed his concerns with the sister first.\n\nSo the author's action was a reality check, but maybe the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his sister first and instead publicly corrected the boyfriend, which could have been more tactfully handled. Therefore, answer A.\n"
