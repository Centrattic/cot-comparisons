My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating him for less than three months, and the author has concerns about his behavior\u2014like drunk driving with her in the car and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author, leading them to tell him he's not family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate based on the given info. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: They confronted the boyfriend about calling him family. The author's reasons are based on disapproval of the boyfriend's behavior and wanting to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposing the sister to danger) are problematic. The author's response was direct but might come off as harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to protect their sister and set boundaries. The boyfriend's attempts to bond with the author might be overstepping, especially given the short relationship. The author's comment was firm but not necessarily aggressive, just stating the facts. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more tactfully. Instead of \"You're not my family,\" perhaps a softer approach would have been better to avoid making the sister upset. Also, the sister's autonomy in choosing her partner should be respected, even if the author disapproves. \n\nBut the key points are that the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior and was clear about not wanting to befriend him. The confrontation might have been abrupt, but the underlying reasons are justified. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their sister. So the answer is probably B (No). However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to make sure I'm not missing something. \n\nWait, did the author have the right to intervene? The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, so the author's concern is valid. The sister's choice is her own, but the author is trying to protect her. The comment about not being family might have been a way to assert that boundary. While the approach could be improved, the intent is to protect the sister, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
