My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone the author finds problematic, and the boyfriend acting too familiar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is in a relationship with someone who's young and made some risky decisions, like drunk driving with her and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned about her safety but hasn't confronted her directly. Instead, they confronted the boyfriend by telling him he's not family, which led to the sister not contacting them since.\n\nThe main question is about the author's actions. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author's intent was to set boundaries and protect their sister, which is understandable. The boyfriend's behavior (calling them brother, showing up uninvited) could be seen as overstepping. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't respecting their family's space.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the sister first but went straight to the boyfriend. This could have been a direct way to address the issue, but maybe it was more effective to talk to the sister first to express concerns. However, the sister might have already been aware of the risks and chose to date him anyway. The author's approach might have come off as harsh, causing the sister to distance herself, which complicates the situation.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions of trying to befriend the family could be genuine, but the author's blunt response might have made him feel unwelcome without giving him a chance to adjust his behavior. However, given the boyfriend's past actions, the author has valid reasons to be cautious.\n\nI need to assess whether the author overstepped by telling the boyfriend directly. In family dynamics, boundaries are important. The author's statement \"You're not my family\" is a clear boundary, but the method of delivery might be seen as confrontational. However, considering the boyfriend's actions and the author's concerns, the boundary might be necessary for their own comfort, even if it upset the sister.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intent was protective, but the approach might not have been the best. However, the boyfriend's behavior was also intrusive. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer would depend on whether the author's method was inappropriate regardless of the intent. If the author considered the sister's feelings and the context, perhaps they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, if they should have had a conversation with the sister first, maybe they are. Since the user is asking for A or B, I need to decide if the author's actions were wrong. Considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were setting boundaries based on valid concerns, even if the sister was upset.\n"
