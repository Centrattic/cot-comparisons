My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has some concerning behaviors: drunk driving with her in the car, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about their sister's safety. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they've been trying to respect their sister's choice.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found inappropriate. The author then directly told him he's not family, which the sister might have taken as offensive. The author's intent was to set a boundary, not to be hostile. \n\nThe key points here are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the need to establish clear boundaries. Even though the author's sister might be upset, the boyfriend's actions are risky. The author isn't trying to control who their sister dates but is making it clear that there's a limit to how close they want the boyfriend to be with their family. \n\nCalling someone out for inappropriate behavior is a valid action, especially when it's about safety. The author's actions are justified as a way to protect their sister and maintain appropriate boundaries within the family. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
