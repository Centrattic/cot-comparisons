My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author thinks the boyfriend is making dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about their sister's safety and well-being. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now because they respect her choice to date who she wants.\n\nThen, the boyfriend starts showing up uninvited, being overly friendly, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The author feels that the boyfriend is encroaching on family space without being actual family. The breaking point comes when the author tells the boyfriend he's not family, leading to the sister not talking to the author since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is concerned about their sister's safety and boundaries. They might be justified in wanting to protect her, especially if the boyfriend is indeed engaging in risky behavior. The author's actions could be seen as a way to set boundaries to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too familiar with the family, which could lead to more issues if the relationship continues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did confront the boyfriend directly without maybe giving him a chance to explain or change his behavior first. The sister might feel that the author is overstepping by interfering in her relationship. However, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous ex-felon) are serious and could put the sister at risk, so the author has valid concerns.\n\nThe key points here are the safety of the sister versus respecting her autonomy. The author is trying to protect their sister from potential harm, which is a common concern in family dynamics. The boyfriend's behavior is objectively dangerous, so the author's intervention might be necessary even if it causes tension with the sister.\n\nIn terms of the direct action\u2014telling the boyfriend he's not family\u2014it's a way to assert boundaries. While it might come off as harsh, it's a clear message that the author doesn't want the boyfriend to be considered part of the family, which could prevent further unwanted behavior. The boyfriend's response was just \"alright,\" and the author walked away, which doesn't seem aggressive, just firm.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had legitimate concerns about their sister's safety and were trying to set boundaries. However, there's a balance between protecting family and respecting their choices. The sister might be upset because the author didn't talk to her first, but given the boyfriend's actions, the author's actions could be justified.\n"
