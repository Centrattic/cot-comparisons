My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me read the situation again to understand better.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend because he's made dangerous choices, like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then told him he's not family but the guy she's dating. Now, the sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the author is concerned about their sister's safety, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's actions are risky. But the way the author addressed it directly might have come off as harsh, especially since they haven't known each other long. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to express their concerns, especially regarding their sister's well-being. But the method of confrontation\u2014telling the boyfriend he's not family\u2014could be seen as dismissive or hurtful. The boyfriend might have felt targeted, even if the author's intentions were protective. \n\nAlso, the sister might be upset because the author didn't discuss this with her first. Maybe the sister is trying to make the relationship work despite the concerns, and the author's direct approach might have upset that dynamic. \n\nBut then again, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is important. However, the approach might have been too abrupt. Maybe suggesting the author should have talked to their sister first to express their worries instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nIn terms of whether it was wrong, maybe it's a combination of both. The author's intentions were good, but the method could have been better. However, in terms of a strict right/wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their sister, but perhaps the approach could have been more tactful. \n\nBut the question is if they are in the wrong. Given that the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, the author's concern is valid. However, the way they addressed it might have alienated their sister. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have legitimate concerns and were trying to set boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
