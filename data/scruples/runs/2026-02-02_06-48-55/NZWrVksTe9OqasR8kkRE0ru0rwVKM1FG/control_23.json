My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The key points here are the boyfriend's behavior, the sister's autonomy, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has some questionable actions. He wrecked the car while drunk with the sister in it and got her into a situation with a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and the boyfriend's character. The sister is the one in the relationship, so it's her choice, but the author is worried about her well-being.\n\nThe author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt it was time to set boundaries, so they told the boyfriend he's not family. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, which might indicate some conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their sister and setting boundaries, which is reasonable, especially given the boyfriend's risky behavior. On the other hand, the author is being direct and might have overstepped by telling the boyfriend he's not family, even if the boyfriend was being pushy. The sister might feel her partner is being targeted, which could explain the fallout.\n\nBut the author's main issue is the boyfriend's actions that put her sister at risk. The author's statement was a way to assert that the boyfriend isn't part of the family, which is a valid boundary. The boyfriend's behavior justifies the author's concern. So, while the author's approach might have been harsh, the intent was to protect the sister, which is not wrong. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the author's actions were in response to the boyfriend's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
