My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the boyfriend's questionable behavior and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend did some dangerous things: drunk driving with the sister, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned, which makes sense. They kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"family,\" which the author found insincere.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that the boyfriend is overstepping boundaries by trying to be part of the family. The author corrected him by saying he's not family, which led to a cold response from the sister. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFrom a perspective of family dynamics, the author has a right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, and the author's sister is the one who chooses who to date. However, the author's sister might feel that their brother is being judgmental or overstepping by interfering. The key here is whether the author acted appropriately in asserting their boundaries without being hostile.\n\nThe author didn't confront the sister's choices directly but addressed the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend might have felt slighted, but the author's message was clear. Since the author's sister hasn't responded, there might be tension, but the author's intent was to set a boundary, not to attack the relationship.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. They have concerns about the boyfriend's actions and were clarifying the relationship dynamic. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
