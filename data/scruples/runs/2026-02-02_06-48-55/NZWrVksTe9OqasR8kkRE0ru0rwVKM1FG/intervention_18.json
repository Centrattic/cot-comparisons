My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The author's sister is dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014driving drunk with her sister, hanging out with an ex-felon, etc. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. Then the author told the boyfriend he's not family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to set a boundary because they felt the boyfriend was overstepping. The boyfriend was showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and the author was concerned about their sister's safety. The author's actions were direct but maybe abrupt. They said, \"You're not my family,\" which could be harsh. But considering the context of the boyfriend's behavior and the author's concerns, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister is responsible for her choices, and the boyfriend was trying to connect with the family. The author might have handled it differently, like talking to their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the author did mention they kept their opinions to themselves until this point. The confrontation happened when the author felt the line was crossed with the \"brother\" and \"fam\" comments.\n\nThe key points are: the author's valid concerns about safety, the boyfriend's pushy behavior, and the author's attempt to set boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their sister and correcting a misperceived relationship. However, the way it was done could have been more tactful. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author had legitimate reasons and was trying to address the situation, even if the method was harsh.\n"
