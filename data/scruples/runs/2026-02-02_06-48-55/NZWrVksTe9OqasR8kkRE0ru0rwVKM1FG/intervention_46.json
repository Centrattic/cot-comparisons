My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months, and the author has issues with his behavior\u2014like driving drunk with her sister and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and using \"fam,\" which the author found inappropriate, so they told him he's not family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and the boyfriend's questionable actions. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend's behavior (showing up uninvited, being overly familiar) pushed them to set a boundary. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's dangerous actions, the author's right to protect their sister, and the communication style used. The author's statement, while direct, was a boundary to clarify that the boyfriend isn't part of their family. However, the method of communication might be harsh. Instead of just saying \"you're not my family,\" maybe a more empathetic approach could have been better. But does that make the author in the wrong?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. The author isn't just being petty; they have valid concerns. The sister's choice to date someone who endangered her could warrant intervention. The author is in a tricky spot\u2014respecting their sister's autonomy while protecting her from harm. \n\nBut the line between being protective and being overbearing can be thin. The author might have been better off talking to their sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the text says the author kept their opinions to themselves until now, so maybe they felt the need to address the boyfriend's intrusiveness.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly familiar is indeed an issue. The author's statement could be seen as necessary to set boundaries. However, the way it was delivered might have been abrupt, potentially causing more harm than good. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a mix of justified concern and maybe a harsh delivery. They might not be in the wrong because they had valid reasons to be protective. The boyfriend's actions are a red flag, so the author's intervention is understandable. But the approach could have been softer. Still, the core issue is the boyfriend's behavior, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
