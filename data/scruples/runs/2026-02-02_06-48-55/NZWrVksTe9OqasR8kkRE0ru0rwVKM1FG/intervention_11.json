My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some pretty serious issues with the boyfriend\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which is what pushed the author to say he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's actions are risky and potentially harmful to the sister. The author is concerned about their sister's safety, which is a valid reason for concern. However, the author's direct confrontation was about the term \"family.\" The boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the sister's family, which is common when someone is getting serious in a relationship. \n\nBut the author's sister is the one in the relationship, so the boyfriend's attempts to bond with the sister's family could be seen as appropriate if he's trying to integrate into her life. However, the author's sister might not have communicated to the boyfriend that this was making her sibling uncomfortable. The author's message is clear: they don't want the boyfriend to think he's part of the family, especially given his behavior.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, it's the sister's choice who she dates, and the author should respect that. But the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author is trying to protect their sister. The comment about not being family might come off as harsh, but it's a way to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author overstepped by directly confronting the boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are problematic, so the author has valid concerns. However, addressing the issue by telling the boyfriend he's not family might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have discussed their concerns with their sister first. But given the circumstances, the author's intention is to protect their sister, even if the method was a bit direct. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are motivated by concern for their sister's safety and setting boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh. The boyfriend's behavior is a red flag, and the author is trying to make him aware that his overfamiliarity is unwelcome.\n"
