My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. So, the author told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't responded since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A or B. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister from someone they see as a bad influence. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author might feel that setting boundaries is necessary for their sister's safety. The author might also feel uncomfortable with the boyfriend trying to integrate into the family too quickly, given the short dating period.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister is an adult and has the right to choose who she dates. The author's confrontation might come off as confrontational or dismissive, even if well-intentioned. Using harsh words like \"You're not my family\" could be seen as cutting off the boyfriend's attempts to bond with the family, which might not be the best approach. The sister might feel that her choice is being undermined, leading to her withdrawal.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions are concerning, but the author's response was direct. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been to talk to the sister privately about their concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the author might not want to meddle, respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe key points are the safety concerns and the method of addressing them. If the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely dangerous, the author might feel justified in taking a stand. However, the way it was done could be seen as abrupt. The sister's reaction suggests that the approach might not have been well-received.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the approach was appropriate given the circumstances. If the author's intention was to protect their sister and they felt that a direct confrontation was necessary to set boundaries, then maybe not in the wrong. But if the method was harsh and caused unnecessary conflict, then perhaps A. However, given the dangerous behavior of the boyfriend, the author's actions might be seen as a justified attempt to protect their sister, making B the answer. But I need to balance between the method and the intention. The author did keep their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they tried to respect their sister's choice. The final confrontation was a direct but perhaps blunt way to address the situation. Considering all, the author might not be in the wrong because their intentions were protective, even if the delivery was harsh. So answer B.\n"
