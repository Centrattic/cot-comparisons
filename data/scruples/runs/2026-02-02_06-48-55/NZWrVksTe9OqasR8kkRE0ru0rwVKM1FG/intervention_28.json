My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has personal feelings that the boyfriend is an idiot, which might be a bit harsh, but maybe they're concerned. The boyfriend made some dangerous decisions\u2014drunk driving with the sister in the car and taking her around a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about their sister's safety.\n\nThe author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited at their apartment, being overly friendly, and using family terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" When the author finally told the boyfriend he's not family, it led to the sister being upset and cutting off communication.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they're curious for another opinion.\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend is being intrusive. The dangerous behavior is a valid concern for the sister's safety. However, the author is not the one in a relationship with the boyfriend, so maybe they shouldn't be so direct about it. The sister is the one who should decide who she dates and who gets to be part of her life. By confronting the boyfriend, the author might have overstepped, especially since they didn't talk to the sister first.\n\nBut then, the author did mention that it was a reality check. The boyfriend's actions were concerning, and the author's intervention was to set clear boundaries. However, the method of confrontation\u2014telling him he's not family\u2014might have been harsh without discussing it with the sister first. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the sister about their concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and get close to the family, which is normal for someone in a relationship. The author's response might have been abrupt and could have caused unnecessary tension. The sister's anger makes sense because her partner was being addressed directly about being part of the family, which is her decision to make.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intentions were protective, but the approach might have been inconsiderate. The key points are whether the author had the right to confront the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first and if the message was delivered in a way that respected the sister's autonomy.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they didn't address the concerns with their sister before confronting the boyfriend. The sister should have the agency to make decisions about her relationship, and the author's direct approach without discussing with her first could have been disrespectful. The author's role is to support their sister, not to dictate who she can be close to. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
