My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The sister is dating this guy for less than three months, and the author has personal issues with him\u2014like dangerous behavior and being around a known ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then told him he's not family, leading to the sister not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about their sister's safety because the boyfriend has made risky decisions, like drunk driving and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon. The author hasn't said anything before but now feels the boyfriend is getting too close. The main action is the author setting a boundary by stating he's not family. The sister is upset, so maybe the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the sister has the right to choose her partner, and the author might be overstepping by interfering. Family dynamics can be tricky, especially when it's clear it's the sister's choice. But on the other hand, the author is concerned about safety. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author might have a valid reason to be worried. However, the way the author addressed it might come off as harsh or dismissive, especially given the short time frame of the relationship.\n\nThe author's intention was to set a boundary, which is understandable. But by calling him out directly, maybe they didn't consider the sister's feelings or the boyfriend's intentions. The boyfriend might just be trying to bond with the family, which is normal, but the author's response could be seen as hostile. The sister's silence after that suggests it might have hurt her feelings.\n\nI need to weigh the sister's autonomy against the author's concern for her safety. The author's actions might be justified if the boyfriend is genuinely a threat. However, the method of confronting the issue could be problematic. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe the author should have discussed their concerns with their sister first. By addressing the boyfriend directly without talking to the sister, the author might have bypassed the appropriate steps, leading to a conflict.\n\nAlso, considering the timeline\u2014three months isn't a long time. The author's immediate judgment might not account for potential changes in the boyfriend's behavior. The author's statement about the boyfriend being an idiot could be a bias affecting their judgment. It's possible the author's personal feelings are clouding their ability to assess the situation objectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns about safety are valid, the approach they took could be seen as overstepping. The sister's autonomy in choosing her partner is important, and the author might have handled the situation by discussing their concerns with the sister first rather than directly confronting the boyfriend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's choice and the relationship dynamics.\n"
