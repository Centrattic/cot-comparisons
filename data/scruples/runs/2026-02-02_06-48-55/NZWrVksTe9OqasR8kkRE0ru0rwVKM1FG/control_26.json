My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior: he's young, maybe an idiot, drove drunk with the sister in the car, took her to meet a scary ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about the sister's safety but hasn't said much until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. When the author told him he's not family, the sister hasn't communicated since, implying she's upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's main issue is the boyfriend overstepping boundaries by acting like part of the family. The author is concerned about the sister's safety due to the boyfriend's dangerous actions. But the sister is the one in the relationship, so the author is respecting her choice to date him. The author's actions were to set a boundary, not to interfere directly with the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister, which is a common motivation. On the other, the author's comment might have been harsh or abrupt, leading to the sister being upset. However, the author didn't confront the boyfriend about the dangerous behaviors but instead focused on the boundaries. \n\nFrom a typical \"AITA\" perspective, sometimes it's about respecting the sister's autonomy. The author's actions were to correct the boyfriend's assumption about being family, which the author felt was inappropriate given the short dating duration and the concerns about his behavior. The author's comment was a firm boundary, which might be seen as necessary to prevent the boyfriend from getting too comfortable with family members. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have addressed the dangerous behaviors first with the sister, rather than focusing on the relationship boundaries. However, the author did mention they've kept their opinions to themselves until now, indicating they were trying to be polite. The comment about not being family might have been a way to set a boundary without directly confronting the sister about her choice of partner.\n\nIn many similar cases, the advice is that it's okay to set boundaries with family members' partners, even if it's not the partner's role to interfere with the relationship itself. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for setting that boundary. The sister's reaction (not talking since) might be a result of her not appreciating the public correction or feeling that the author is meddling. But the author's intention was to clarify boundaries, which is a valid approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (Not the Asshole). The author acted to set a boundary, which is reasonable, even if the method could be improved. The dangerous behaviors are a concern for the sister to address, but the author's comment about not being family is about personal boundaries, which is their right.\n"
