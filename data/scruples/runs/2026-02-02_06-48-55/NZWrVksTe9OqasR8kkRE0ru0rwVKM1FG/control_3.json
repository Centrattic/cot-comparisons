My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy's behavior\u2014like driving drunk with her sister, hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon, and maybe dealing drugs. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, acting too familiar, and calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" Then the author told him he's not family, leading to tension.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A or B. The user wants a straightforward answer, just A or B. Let me think about the factors here.\n\nFirst, the author's sister is allowed to date whoever she wants. However, the boyfriend's actions are concerning\u2014driving drunk and associating with a dangerous person. The author is worried about their sister's safety. But the author's response was to confront the boyfriend directly, telling him he's not family. The sister hasn't responded since, which may indicate she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to express concern. Even though the boyfriend is a minor, the author is within their rights to worry about their sister. However, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly calling the boyfriend out\u2014might have been harsh. The author might have considered discussing their concerns with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. Also, using the term \"family\" might have been a trigger because it's personal. But the boyfriend was overstepping by trying to be too close with the author. So, the author's intent was to set boundaries, which is reasonable, but the method might have been abrupt. However, given the boyfriend's actions, the author's concern is valid. So, is the author wrong? It's a balance between respecting the sister's autonomy and protecting her from a potentially harmful situation. The author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their sister's interest, even if the approach could have been more diplomatic.\n"
