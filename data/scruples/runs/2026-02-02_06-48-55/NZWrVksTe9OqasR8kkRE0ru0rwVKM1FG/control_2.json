My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author has some issues with him. The guy made some dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister and exposing her to a risky ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves initially, but then the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him off, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern is the sister's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's actions are risky and potentially harmful. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is a common and understandable motive. However, the sister is an adult and makes her own choices, even if those choices are risky. The author's intervention might be seen as overstepping, especially since it's the sister's decision who she dates.\n\nBut then there's the part where the boyfriend is trying to integrate into the family, using familial terms, which the author finds intrusive. The author's response was to tell him he's not family, which might have been necessary to set boundaries. However, the way the author did it could have been more diplomatic. Instead of being blunt, maybe a more constructive approach would have been better to avoid hurting feelings and causing a rift with the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's autonomy versus the author's protective instincts. The author isn't wrong to be concerned, but they might have handled it in a way that alienated the sister. The sister's relationship is her choice, and the author's direct confrontation might have been too harsh, especially without discussing it with the sister first. The author could have addressed the dangerous behavior with the sister instead of the boyfriend directly, to avoid making the sister feel like her partner is being targeted by her family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the method was appropriate. While the intent was to protect, the approach might have been too confrontational and dismissive. The author could have chosen a different way to set boundaries without cutting off the sister. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
