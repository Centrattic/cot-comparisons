My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author doesn't like the guy because he's young, made dangerous decisions (like drunk driving with her sister and involving an ex-felon), and they're worried about the guy's influence. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family but the guy currently dating their sister.\n\nThe author's sister hasn't spoken to them since. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's concern for their sister's safety, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person), and the author's direct confrontation over being called family.\n\nNow, considering the author's intentions. They were probably trying to protect their sister and set boundaries with the boyfriend. But the way they did it might have come off as harsh. The author admits that the guy might be trying to be friendly and get close to the family. However, the author felt the need to clarify that the boyfriend isn't really part of the family, especially given his harmful behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, they have a valid concern for their sister's safety. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by directly confronting the boyfriend in a blunt way, which could have caused a rift with their sister. \n\nBut the boyfriend was making the author uncomfortable by trying to be overly familiar. The author might have had a right to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend's presence was a risk. However, the method might not have been the best. Instead of outright saying he's not family, maybe the author could have addressed the behavior without alienating the boyfriend or their sister. \n\nAlternatively, since the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, the author's concern is justified. If the sister is in a harmful situation, the author might feel compelled to act. But the approach taken could have been more tactful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author's main goal was to protect their sister, maybe they're justified. But the way they handled it might have been too direct, leading to a family conflict. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author shouldn't dictate the relationship dynamics between their sister and her partner. However, given the boyfriend's dangerous actions, the author might feel it's necessary to warn him. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's intent was protective, but the method could have been better. However, considering the boyfriend's behavior, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
