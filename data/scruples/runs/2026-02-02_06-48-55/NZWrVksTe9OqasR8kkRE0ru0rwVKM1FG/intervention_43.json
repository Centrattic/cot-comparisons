My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is that the sister's boyfriend has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her in the truck and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author, while respecting their sister's choice to date him, found it annoying when the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which probably upset the sister.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's actions and the context. The boyfriend's behavior is questionable, and the author is trying to set boundaries. The question is whether the author was wrong to be direct about not considering the boyfriend family. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend is being overbearing or inappropriate. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author might be concerned about their sister's safety. However, the author is also respecting the sister's autonomy by not interfering more than necessary, just setting a clear boundary when the boyfriend started to overstep.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't attack the boyfriend's relationship but clarified their own stance. The sister might feel her partner was disrespected, but the author's statement was a boundary, not a criticism of the relationship itself. It's about defining their own relationship with the boyfriend. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their own family boundaries without being aggressive. The boyfriend misinterpreted the author's friendliness, and the author corrected that without being hostile. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They set a necessary boundary given the boyfriend's problematic behavior and the author's role as a family member.\n"
