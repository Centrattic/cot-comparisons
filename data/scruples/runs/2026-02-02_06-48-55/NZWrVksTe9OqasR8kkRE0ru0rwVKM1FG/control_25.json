My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family\" is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior: drunk driving with the sister, associating with a known felon to buy drugs, etc. The author has kept their opinions to themselves, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which led to the sister not contacting them since.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. The key points are: the author is concerned about their sister's safety due to the boyfriend's dangerous behavior. They've kept their opinions private, which is respecting the sister's autonomy. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts to encroach on the family dynamic by trying to be part of the family, which the author is uncomfortable with. The author's statement was a boundary-setting action, not an attack on the relationship itself. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) are significant red flags. The author is justified in being concerned about their sister's well-being. However, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend he's not family, maybe discussing their concerns with the sister first would have been better. But the author's intention was to set a boundary and clarify their relationship, not to interfere with the sister's choice of partner.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. If the author's sister feels that her boyfriend was disrespected or that her autonomy is being undermined, that could be why she's upset. But the author's main issue is about the boyfriend overstepping by calling them family, which the author rightly felt was inappropriate given the short time and the boyfriend's problematic behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid concerns and were trying to set a boundary. However, the method might have been harsh. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether they could have done better. The answer is likely B (No), because the author's actions were about protecting their sister and setting boundaries, not interfering in the relationship itself.\n"
