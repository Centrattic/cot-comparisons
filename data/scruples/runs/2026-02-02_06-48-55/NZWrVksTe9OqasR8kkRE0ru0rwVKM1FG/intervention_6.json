My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author dislikes the boyfriend because of dangerous behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating. The author then bluntly told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the safety concerns and the author's approach. The boyfriend's actions could be risky for the sister, so the author is worried. However, the author is the one who confronted the boyfriend directly. The sister's autonomy in choosing her partner is a factor. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the author had valid safety concerns and was protecting their sister. On the other, confronting the boyfriend in that way might have been harsh and could have been done more respectfully. The author's sister might feel that her choice was disrespected, leading to her not contacting the author. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author had expressed concerns through the sister first, maybe. But since they directly addressed the boyfriend, even with valid reasons, it might have been a misstep in approach. However, given the dangerous behavior, the author's intent was protective. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the method was appropriate. If the author had a right to express concerns but did so in a way that was dismissive, then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the boyfriend's actions were genuinely concerning, the author had a reason. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to protect their sister from a potentially harmful situation, even if the confrontation was direct. The key is the safety issue, which justifies the intervention.\n"
