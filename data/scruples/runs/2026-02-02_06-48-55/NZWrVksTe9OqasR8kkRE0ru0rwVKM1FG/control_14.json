My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not considered family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior: drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. These are serious red flags. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they were trying to respect their sister's autonomy.\n\nThe issue arises when the boyfriend starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and shows up uninvited to their apartment. The author feels that this is overstepping boundaries. By saying, \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now,\" the author is setting a boundary. \n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions, the author has valid safety concerns. The boyfriend's behavior is risky and could endanger the sister. The author's intervention might be a way to protect their sister, even if it upsets her. \n\nHowever, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend he's not family, perhaps discussing their concerns with the sister first could have been more effective. But given the situation, the author is trying to set a boundary to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too familiar, which could lead to more issues. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014showing up uninvited, being overly familiar\u2014suggest he might be testing boundaries. The author's response, while direct, is a way to communicate that there's a limit. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their sister and family. However, the method might be harsh, but the intent is to prevent potential harm. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for a more diplomatic approach, the author's intentions are rooted in concern for their sister's well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
