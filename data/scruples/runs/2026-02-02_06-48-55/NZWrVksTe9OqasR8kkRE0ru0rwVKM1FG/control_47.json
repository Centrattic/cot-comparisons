My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has some red flags: driving drunk with her in the car, involving her with an ex-felon to buy drugs, which is dangerous. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they've been trying to respect their sister's choice. But the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating and inappropriate. The author then confronts him, stating he's not family, which leads to tension with the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's behavior. If he's putting the sister in dangerous situations, that's a valid concern. However, the author's approach might be seen as harsh. Telling someone they're not family could come off as dismissive, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly. The sister might feel the author is overstepping, interfering in her relationship. But the author's intention was to set boundaries, not to be hostile. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries to protect their family. On the other hand, the way they communicated it might have been abrupt. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's concern is justified. However, maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the sister first rather than confront the boyfriend directly. But since the author was polite until now, this might be a justified boundary.\n\nSo, the author's actions are based on valid concerns, but the method could have been handled more sensitively. But overall, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
