My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some unsafe behavior by the boyfriend, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves but got upset when the boyfriend started acting like part of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister is in a relationship, and the boyfriend's actions are risky. The author is worried about their sister's safety. But the author is a family member, so they have a right to be concerned. However, the author chose to confront the boyfriend directly instead of talking to their sister first. That might be a problem because the sister has the autonomy to choose her partner, even if he's making bad decisions.\n\nThe key point here is the author's approach. Instead of addressing the sister first to express their concerns, the author directly told the boyfriend he's not family. That could come off as harsh and might have caused the sister to feel her choice is being disrespected. The author might be justified in being concerned about safety, but the method of confrontation might be the issue. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly, which the author acknowledges. Cutting off the relationship so abruptly without discussing it with the sister first could have made the sister feel that her partner is being attacked, leading to her cutting off the author. So, while the author's intentions were to protect their sister, the way they handled it could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's not the author's place to dictate who the sister can be close to. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving the sister first and for being confrontational with the boyfriend directly.\n"
