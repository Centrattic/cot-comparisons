My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was wrong in telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister is dating a guy for less than three months. The author thinks the guy has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with his sister in the car and hanging out with a scary ex-felon. The author is concerned but hasn't spoken up before. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then told the boyfriend that he's not family, just the guy his sister is dating. The sister hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting his sister. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author is justified in being concerned. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and trying to get close might be overstepping. The author's comment could be seen as setting boundaries to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too familiar or assuming a closer relationship than appropriate. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't respecting the sister's choice to date him if he's making her get into dangerous situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the sister's sibling, so it's their role to look out for her. However, the author is being confrontational and direct. The boyfriend was just trying to be friendly, maybe trying to bond with his girlfriend's family, which is common. The author's harsh reply might have been unnecessary and could have damaged the relationship between him and his sister. The sister might feel that the author is overstepping by judging her partner, especially since she's the one choosing to date him. The author's comment might have come across as dismissive or disrespectful, even if the intention was to set boundaries.\n\nBut considering the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person), the author's concern is valid. However, the way the author addressed it might not have been the best approach. Instead of a blunt statement, maybe discussing the concerns with the sister first would have been better. By directly confronting the boyfriend without talking to his sister, the author might have bypassed her agency in the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: Valid concern vs. the method of communication. The author isn't wrong for caring about his sister's safety, but the approach might have been too harsh and possibly hurtful, leading to the sister being upset. The author's right to set boundaries with the boyfriend is there, but the way it was done might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong because they didn't approach it in a way that respects their sister's autonomy while addressing the boyfriend's behavior.\n"
