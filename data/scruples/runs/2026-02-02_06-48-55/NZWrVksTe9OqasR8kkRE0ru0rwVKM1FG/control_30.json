My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family, and now the sister is upset and hasn't contacted them since. The author's reasons are that the boyfriend made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister and associating with an ex-felon known for selling drugs. They also mention that the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is in a relationship, and the boyfriend is trying to be part of the family. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they were respecting their sister's autonomy. But the boyfriend's behavior is concerning\u2014drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a dangerous person. The author intervened when the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and being overly familiar.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is worried about their sister's safety and well-being. It's reasonable for a family member to express concern when someone they care about is in a relationship with a potentially harmful person. However, the way the author communicated this might have been abrupt. Telling someone they're not family could come off as dismissive or harsh, even if the author's intentions were protective. The sister might feel that her choice is being undermined, especially if the boyfriend is trying to integrate into the family. \n\nBut the author did mention they understand the boyfriend's intent to be friendly and get close. The key here is the danger involved. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a criminal) are serious safety issues. The author might be justified in setting boundaries to protect their sister and themselves. The sister's reaction could be a result of feeling her partner was criticized or excluded, which might not have been the author's intent. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for caring about their sister's safety and setting personal boundaries. However, the method of communication could have been more delicate. Instead of directly stating \"you're not family,\" maybe a more private and empathetic approach could have been better to avoid causing immediate offense. \n\nSo, considering the dangerous behavior of the boyfriend, the author's actions were likely in their sister's best interest. The sister's upset reaction is understandable, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They had valid concerns and tried to address them without taking over the relationship. The answer is probably B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their sister's safety and clarifying their relationship boundaries, even if the delivery could have been improved.\n"
