My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior: driving drunk with her sister, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. These are serious safety concerns. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they've tried to stay out of it.\n\nThen, the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, acting overly familiar, using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt this was overstepping, especially given the short duration of the relationship. They directly told him he's not family, which led to the sister not responding since then.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior might have been perceived as intrusive. The author's intent was to protect their sister and establish where they stand, not to interfere in her dating life. However, maybe the approach could have been handled more tactfully. But given the context of the boyfriend's actions, the author's reaction is understandable. The sister's silence might be due to feeling her relationship was criticized. \n\nSo, considering the safety issues and the need to set boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
