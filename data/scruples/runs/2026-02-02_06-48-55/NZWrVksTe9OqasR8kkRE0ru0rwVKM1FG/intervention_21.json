My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot, made dangerous choices (like drunk driving with her in the truck and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs), and is worried about his influence on their sister. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate. They then told him he's not family, leading to a possible fallout with their sister.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safety concerns of the boyfriend's actions and the author's response to his attempts to be part of the family. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior posing danger to their sister and now his overstepping by trying to be part of the family. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to tell the boyfriend he's not family. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFrom a safety perspective, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous person to buy drugs) are serious. The author's concern is valid because these actions could endanger their sister. However, the way the author addressed it might be problematic. By directly confronting the boyfriend about not being family, it could come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially if the intention was to push him away. \n\nBut considering that the author had a legitimate concern and the boyfriend was overstepping boundaries, the author might have a right to set those boundaries. The sister's choice to date him is her decision, but the author's role is to protect their sister from potential harm. The confrontation might have been abrupt, but given the context of the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary step to protect their sister and family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to their sister first to express their concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. That might have been a more constructive approach, avoiding potential conflict and showing respect for the sister's relationship. However, the author's main issue is the boyfriend's actions, not the relationship itself. So, the confrontation might be justified as a way to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close to the family when there are safety concerns.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily wrong because they're trying to protect their sister from a potentially harmful situation. However, the method could have been more tactful. But based on the given options, the more accurate answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions stem from valid safety concerns and setting boundaries to protect their sister.\n"
