My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for less than three months. The author personally thinks the guy isn't great\u2014calls him an idiot, mentions he's young, and made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves because it's the sister's choice who she dates. However, the boyfriend started showing up at the author's apartment, hanging around when they visit their mom, and started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt this was overstepping, so they told the guy he's not family but just the guy the sister is dating. The guy responded with \"alright\" and the author walked away. Now the sister hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior encroaching on family boundaries. The boyfriend is acting like he's part of the family, which the author finds annoying and inappropriate. The author's actions were to confront the boyfriend directly and set a boundary by stating he's not family. The sister is upset, leading to a possible fallout.\n\nNow, thinking about family dynamics and boundaries. It's common for people to have different levels of comfort with their partner interacting with their family. The boyfriend's actions\u2014calling the author \"brother\" and showing up uninvited\u2014might be seen as overreaching, especially if the author isn't comfortable with it. The author's sister might feel that the author is interfering in her relationship, even if the boyfriend's actions are concerning.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author's intention was to set a boundary, not to attack the boyfriend's relationship. However, the method of confrontation might have been abrupt. The author could have discussed the issue with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. By doing so, the author might have bypassed the sister's authority in the relationship, which could explain why she's upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior could be genuinely problematic. The author has valid concerns about the boyfriend's past actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person). However, those issues are the sister's to handle with her partner, unless the author felt imminent danger. The author's main issue here is the boyfriend's familiarity, not the safety concerns, which they had kept to themselves until now.\n\nSo, the author's action was to enforce a personal boundary, but doing so without addressing the sister first might have been the mistake. The sister might feel that her partner is being insulted by a family member without her input. The author might have overstepped by not involving the sister in the conversation first, leading to the sister's anger.\n\nAlternatively, setting boundaries with someone who is encroaching on personal space is reasonable. The author might have a right to be uncomfortable with the boyfriend's behavior and assert that. The key is whether the method was appropriate. Confronting the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first could be seen as the error here.\n\nIn many cases, it's best to talk to the sister first about concerns regarding her partner's behavior. The author's approach might have been too direct and could have been handled by discussing with the sister to let her know about the discomfort and let her handle the situation with her partner. By confronting the boyfriend directly without the sister's knowledge, the author might have caused the sister to feel disrespected or undermined.\n\nTherefore, while the author's concerns might be valid, the approach taken could be problematic. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate with their sister first, instead choosing to confront the boyfriend, which led to the sister being upset. However, some might argue that the author had a right to set boundaries regardless. But in terms of family dynamics and respecting the sister's role, A could be the answer.\n"
