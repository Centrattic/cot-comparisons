My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. They feel it's risky for their sister. The guy starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author finds irritating. Finally, they tell him he's not family, just the guy their sister is dating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author is concerned for their sister's safety, which is a valid reason. They kept their opinions to themselves initially, respecting their sister's choice. However, when the boyfriend started encroaching on their personal space by showing up uninvited and being overly familiar, the author felt justified in setting a boundary.\n\nThe main issue is the line between being a concerned sibling and overstepping. The author isn't trying to control their sister's relationship but is asserting their own boundaries. The act of telling the boyfriend he's not family might come off as harsh, but the context of safety concerns and the boyfriend's intrusive behavior could justify it. The sister being upset might indicate the author's approach was too direct, but the intention was protective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to set a boundary and protect their sister, which is understandable. The consequence is a strained relationship with the sister, but that's a possible trade-off. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a criminal) add weight to the author's concerns. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their sister and themselves, even if the method was a bit direct. Answer B.\n"
