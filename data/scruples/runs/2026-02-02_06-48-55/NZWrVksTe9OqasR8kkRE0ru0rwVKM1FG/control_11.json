My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior: he drove drunk with the sister in the car, took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs (though it's unclear what exactly he was getting), and the guy is selling more than just pot. These are serious red flags. The author is worried about his sister's safety and well-being, which is understandable.\n\nThe author kept their opinions to themselves until now. The problem arises when the boyfriend starts coming to the author's apartment, hanging out with him when he visits his mom, and calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author feels that this is overstepping, given the boyfriend's problematic behavior and the short duration of the relationship. The author then tells the boyfriend, \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The boyfriend responds with \"alright\" and walks away. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's concern for their sister's safety, the boyfriend's questionable actions, and the author's boundary-setting regarding family status. The question is whether the author was wrong to set that boundary.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid concern about the boyfriend's actions endangering their sister. The author's intention to protect their sister is justified. However, the method of communication\u2014telling the boyfriend he's not family\u2014might have been harsh, but it's a direct way to set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and trying to bond with the family could be seen as pushy, so the author's reaction might be a way to prevent further intrusion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister is an adult and has the right to make her own choices. The author didn't confront the boyfriend about his behavior directly but instead focused on the familial relationship. This could be seen as not addressing the root issue (the dangerous behavior) and instead focusing on the familial title, which might not be the most effective approach. The sister might feel that the author is overstepping by not discussing her boyfriend's actions with her first, rather than confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nHowever, the author's main point here is about setting a boundary regarding family status, not necessarily about the boyfriend's actions. The sister is the one who has to deal with the relationship, but the author is trying to maintain personal boundaries. The boyfriend's insistence on being called \"family\" could be perceived as trying to gain undue familiarity or pressure, which the author is pushing back against.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach might be seen as a bit abrupt, their concern for their sister's safety and the need to set personal boundaries is valid. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for establishing where they draw the line with the boyfriend, especially given the boyfriend's problematic behavior. The key issue is whether the method was appropriate. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
