My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some key points: the author is protective of their sister due to the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous ex-felon), and the author's direct confrontation when the boyfriend started acting like part of the family.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions seem to stem from concern for their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving with her in the car and involving her with a known ex-felon\u2014are definitely red flags. The author has kept their opinions to themselves, showing some restraint, which is good. However, when the boyfriend started showing up uninvited at their apartment, being overly familiar, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" the author felt it was time to set a boundary.\n\nThe confrontation itself was direct but not abusive. The author clearly stated the boyfriend isn't family, which might have come off as harsh, but given the context of the boyfriend's behavior, it's understandable. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since the boyfriend was encroaching on personal space and using familial terms without the author's consent, the boundary was necessary. However, the way it was communicated might have been abrupt, potentially causing the sister to be upset, but the author's primary concern was valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. The author's sister is in a relationship with someone making dangerous choices, which the author is rightly concerned about. The author's intervention could be seen as an attempt to protect their sister, both from the boyfriend's behavior and from further entanglements with him in their family.\n\nThe sister hasn't spoken to the author since, which might indicate the confrontation upset her, possibly because she feels her choice in partners is being judged. However, the author's actions were aimed at setting clear boundaries, especially after repeated incidents. The boyfriend's insistence on being close without being invited might have crossed a line, so the author's response was a necessary reality check.\n\nIn weighing it, the author's actions were justified given the context. They were trying to protect their sister and set clear boundaries. While the confrontation might have been tactless, the underlying reasons are valid. The boyfriend's behavior is the real issue here, not the author's response.\n"
