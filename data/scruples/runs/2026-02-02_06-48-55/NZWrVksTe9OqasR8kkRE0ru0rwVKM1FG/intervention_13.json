My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's behavior: he was drunk driving with the sister in the car, hung around a known ex-felon to buy drugs, and now the boyfriend is being overly friendly, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author told him, \"You're not my family. You're the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions were appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister from someone they see as dangerous. The boyfriend's actions are risky\u2014drunk driving and associating with a felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they were trying to respect their sister's choice. But when the boyfriend started being too familiar, the author felt the need to set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have come off as hostile or dismissive. Telling someone to their face that they're not family could be harsh, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly. The author's sister might feel that her partner is being criticized, leading to her silence. The key here is whether the author's method of setting a boundary was appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior, like showing up unannounced and being overly attached, could be intrusive. The author might have felt the need to put a stop to it. However, the way they communicated it might have been too direct and could have undermined the sister's autonomy in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author's right to set boundaries. It's reasonable to not want a partner of a sibling to be too familiar or overstepping. But the approach taken might have been confrontational. Maybe a less direct method, like talking to the sister first, would have been better. But the author did say they kept their opinions to themselves until now, so perhaps they felt it was necessary to address it directly when the boyfriend overstepped.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a felon) are serious. The author is concerned for their sister's safety. However, the author's response might have been a bit abrupt. It's possible that the sister's relationship is her choice, and the author's interference could strain family relations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They had valid concerns but handled it in a way that might have been hurtful. The boyfriend was trying to be friendly, and the author's response was blunt. The sister's reaction (not talking to the author) suggests that it might have been a harsh approach. However, the author's intention was to set a boundary, which is understandable. It's a tricky balance between protecting a sibling and respecting their autonomy.\n\nI think the author's intentions were good, but the method could have been more diplomatic. However, considering the boyfriend's behavior, the author's actions might be justified as a way to protect their sister. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author had a reason to set boundaries, even if the delivery wasn't perfect.\n"
