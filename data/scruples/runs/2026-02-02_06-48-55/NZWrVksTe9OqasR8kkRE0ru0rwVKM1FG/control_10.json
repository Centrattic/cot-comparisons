My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister in the car and associating with an ex-felon. They've kept their opinions to themselves so far, which shows they've tried to respect their sister's choice.\n\nThe main issue is the boyfriend treating the author as family, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and showing up uninvited. The author felt this was overstepping, especially since they don't trust the guy. They wanted to set boundaries, so they told him he's not family.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend was probably just trying to be friendly and integrate into the family, which is common in relationships. However, the author's concerns are valid due to the dangerous behavior. The way the author communicated it might have been harsh, but they had a right to set boundaries. It's a balance between respecting their sister's choices and protecting her from potential harm. The key is whether the author overstepped by making such a direct statement. Since the boyfriend was intruding, the author's action was a clear boundary, which is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
