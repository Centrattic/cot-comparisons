My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister's boyfriend who has been acting too familiar and calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author tells him he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister's boyfriend has been involved in some risky behavior with the sister, like drunk driving and being around a dangerous ex-felon. The author is clearly concerned about his sister's safety and the boyfriend's judgment. However, the author is trying to maintain a boundary by not being overly friendly, which makes sense given the circumstances.\n\nThe key point is whether telling the man he's not family was wrong. The author did this after the man started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found intrusive. The author's action was direct but perhaps a bit harsh. The sister might feel that the author is interfering in her relationship, even if the concerns are valid.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to be concerned about their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author is trying to protect their sister. On the other hand, the way the author addressed the issue might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful. It's possible that a more diplomatic approach could have been taken, like discussing the concerns with the sister instead of confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nBut considering the boyfriend was being too familiar, the author's response was a way to set a boundary. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their sister. The problem might be in the approach rather than the intent. Since the author had kept their opinions to themselves before, this outburst might have been a reaction to feeling pushed too far. The sister's reaction (not contacting the author since) suggests that the method might have been too abrupt, but the underlying concern is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the answer depends on the method, maybe A (yes). If it depends on the intent to protect the sister, maybe B (no). But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the action itself. Since the author's action was a direct response to the boyfriend overstepping, and given the boyfriend's questionable behavior, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the approach could have been better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was protective and the boyfriend was overstepping. The author had a right to set boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
