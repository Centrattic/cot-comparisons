My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation involves the author being concerned about the boyfriend's behavior, which includes drunk driving with the sister and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but when the boyfriend started acting too familiar, they confronted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's actions are genuinely concerning\u2014drunk driving is a serious offense, and associating with a known ex-felon, especially for drug-related activities, poses risks. The author is worried about their sister's safety, which is a valid concern. However, the author's approach was to tell the boyfriend he's not family, which might have come off as harsh or dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method they used. The author's intention was protective, trying to set boundaries to keep their sister safe. But the way they communicated it directly to the boyfriend might have been abrupt. The boyfriend might have felt rejected or misunderstood, especially since he was trying to build a relationship with the family. The author's sister might feel that her partner is being criticized, leading to the communication breakdown where she hasn't spoken to her sibling since.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author isn't wrong to be concerned about their sister's safety. On the other hand, the way they addressed the issue might not have been the most constructive. Instead of directly confronting the boyfriend, perhaps a better approach would have been to talk to their sister first, express the concerns, and let her make an informed decision. The author's statement \"You're not my family\" could be seen as a personal attack rather than a concern for their sister's well-being. The boyfriend was likely trying to integrate into the family, and the author's response might have been perceived as unwelcoming without giving him a chance to change his behavior.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were a direct response to feeling that the boyfriend was overstepping boundaries. The line between being protective and being overbearing can be thin. The author might have felt that the boyfriend wasn't respecting their family boundaries, especially with his actions putting their sister at risk. In that case, setting a boundary by clarifying the relationship status isn't necessarily wrong, but the method could have been more tactful.\n\nConsidering the potential consequences: the sister might feel that the author is interfering in her relationship, leading to a rift between them. The boyfriend might feel disrespected, which could affect his relationship with the sister. The author's intention was to protect their sister, but the approach might have caused more harm by creating conflict within the family.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns are valid, the way they addressed them might have been the issue. The confrontation could have been handled more diplomatically. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have approached the situation differently. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the method used was appropriate. If the method was harsh without prior discussion with the sister, then the author is at least partially at fault. But if the situation required immediate boundary-setting due to the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author's action could be justified. \n\nI think the key here is that the author should have first addressed their concerns with their sister before confronting the boyfriend. By confronting the boyfriend directly without discussing it with their sister first, the author might have overstepped, leading to the sister feeling that her partner is being criticized without her input. Therefore, the author's action was a mistake because they didn't follow the appropriate steps of communicating with their sister first. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
