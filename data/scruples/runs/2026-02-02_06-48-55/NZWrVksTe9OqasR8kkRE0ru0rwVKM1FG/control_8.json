My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. So the situation is about the user telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating the guy for under three months, and the guy is young. The user has issues with the guy's behavior\u2014he drove drunk with her sister in the car and took her around a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The user is concerned but hasn't said much until now.\n\nThe guy started calling them brother and using \"fam,\" which made the user uncomfortable. The user then told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't replied, and the user is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think. The user's sister is the one who's dating the guy, so the user's actions might affect her relationship. The user's main concern is safety, given the dangerous situations the boyfriend has put her in. But the user's approach was to confront the guy directly, which might have been harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the user has a legitimate concern for their sister's safety. On the other, cutting off the guy abruptly by saying he's not family might have been hurtful. The user might have assumed the role of judge, and the sister might not appreciate her partner being criticized. The sister might feel like her choice is being undermined, leading to her silence. \n\nBut then again, the user was polite before, but the guy's behavior was concerning. The user might have felt it necessary to set a boundary. However, maybe the user should have talked to their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nSo the key points are: the user's concern is valid (safety issues), but the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. The user's sister's autonomy in choosing her partner is a factor. By confronting the boyfriend, the user might have overstepped, leading to tension with the sister. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with their sister first and instead directly confronted the boyfriend, which could have been a breach of trust. Alternatively, if the boyfriend's actions are genuinely dangerous, the user might be justified in trying to protect their sister, making the answer B (not in the wrong).\n\nBut considering the social dynamics, the user's approach might have been too direct without discussing with their sister first. So the answer could be A. However, given the dangerous situations, maybe the user's actions are understandable. Hmm. I'm a bit split. But in the context of typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads, the community often looks at intent and approach. The user had a valid concern but approached it in a way that might have been confrontational without involving their sister. So maybe the user is in the wrong (A) because they didn't talk to their sister first, leading to possible conflict.\n"
