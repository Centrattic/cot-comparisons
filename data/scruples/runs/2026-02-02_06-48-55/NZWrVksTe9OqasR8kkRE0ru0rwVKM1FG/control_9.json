My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The author has some valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon, and selling drugs. These are serious issues that could put the sister at risk. \n\nThe author has stayed out of it until now, respecting the sister's right to choose her partner. But the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt it was crossing a line, so they confronted him directly. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their sister and setting boundaries, which makes sense given the boyfriend's risky behavior. On the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But since the sister hasn't chosen to end the relationship, the author might have felt it was necessary to step in when the boyfriend was overstepping.\n\nThe key points are the boyfriend's dangerous actions and the author's attempt to set boundaries. The author isn't trying to control their sister's choices but is concerned about her safety. So, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong here. They addressed the issue when it was affecting them personally, not just the sister's relationship.\n"
