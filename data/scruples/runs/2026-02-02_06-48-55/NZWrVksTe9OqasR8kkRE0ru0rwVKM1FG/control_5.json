My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author doesn't think the boyfriend is a good influence\u2014he's young, made dangerous choices like driving drunk with her sister in the car, and hung out with someone who's a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend has been acting too familiar, coming to the author's apartment, attaching himself during visits to their mom, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating. Finally, the author told him he's not family and said he's just the guy the sister is dating. The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and the author left. Now the sister hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong (A) or not (B). Let me think about the key points.\n\nThe author's actions stem from concern for their sister's safety. The boyfriend's behavior has been risky and potentially dangerous. The author is not trying to control their sister's choice in partners but is setting boundaries after the boyfriend overstepped. The issue arises when the boyfriend started treating the author as family, which the author found inappropriate given the short time and the boyfriend's actions.\n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, it's common for family members to feel protective. However, the author did confront the boyfriend directly, which could be seen as a way to enforce those boundaries. The sister might be upset because her boyfriend was treated harshly, but the author's intention was to set clear limits to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too close, possibly to avoid future issues or protect their sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled it differently. Maybe approaching the sister first to express their concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly could have been a better approach. But the author did mention that the sister chose to date him, so the author respects her choice but wanted to address the boyfriend's overfamiliarity.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (like showing up uninvited, being overly attached) might have warranted the author's response. The line between being friendly and crossing into family territory can be thin. The author's statement was direct but not necessarily aggressive, just a reality check.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were based on concern for their sister's safety and setting boundaries. The sister's reaction is understandable, but the author's approach might have been necessary to prevent the boyfriend from feeling too accepted in a family setting, especially given his questionable behavior.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They had valid reasons for their actions, even if it caused tension. The answer would be B.\n"
