My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about this guy's behavior. The guy wrecked their truck while drunk and put the sister in dangerous situations. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and using familial terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is that the boyfriend is acting like part of the family, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author directly told him he's not family, which might have come off as harsh. But the context is that the boyfriend has made dangerous choices, and the author is concerned for their sister's safety. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, the sister is an adult and makes her own decisions. However, the author might be trying to protect her. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon) are serious. The author's intervention could be seen as necessary, but the way it was done\u2014publicly calling him out and making him feel unwelcome\u2014might have been abrupt. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intentions were protective and the situation involves safety concerns, maybe they're justified. But if the approach was disrespectful or without considering the sister's autonomy, maybe they are at fault. The author did mention they tried to keep their opinions to themselves, which shows they were trying to respect the sister's choice. The problem was the boyfriend's behavior towards the author, like showing up uninvited and using familial terms. \n\nThe author's statement was direct but perhaps not malicious. The sister might feel the author is interfering, but the author's actions were to set boundaries. Since the boyfriend made poor choices, the author's warning might be warranted. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author was protecting their sister and setting personal boundaries. However, maybe the way they handled it could have been softer. But given the context of dangerous behavior, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
