My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting their sister's boyfriend, telling him he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior: drunk driving, involving him with an ex-felon to buy drugs, and dangerous choices. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now because they respect the sister's choice. However, the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions. They wanted to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was overstepping. The author's actions were to inform the boyfriend that he's not part of their family, which might come off as harsh, but maybe necessary given the circumstances. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior, like showing up uninvited and being overly familiar, could be seen as intrusive. The author might be trying to protect their sister from what they perceive as a problematic partner. However, the method of confrontation\u2014telling him he's not family\u2014might have been abrupt and could have hurt the sister's feelings, especially if she felt her boyfriend was being criticized.\n\nBut the author's main issue isn't just the boyfriend's presence but the fact that he's treating them as family when they don't see him as trustworthy. They did approach the issue directly, even though it led to a strained relationship with their sister. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the situation involves the author's right to set boundaries, especially concerning their own family and safety concerns. \n\nGiven that the boyfriend's actions are genuinely concerning (drunk driving with the sister, associating with a felon), the author's concerns are valid. While the delivery might have been harsh, the underlying intent was to protect their sister and establish limits. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room to consider better communication strategies.\n"
