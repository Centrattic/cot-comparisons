My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's sister has a boyfriend they don't really like. The boyfriend has done some risky things, like drunk driving with the sister and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned for their sister's safety but has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate. Then the author told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't been in touch, and the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author is worried about their sister. However, the author is not the one in a relationship with the boyfriend; the sister is. So the author's role is more of a concerned sibling. The author's action was to set a boundary by telling the boyfriend he's not family. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and build a relationship with the author's family, which is normal when someone is dating a sibling. However, the author's sister might feel that the boyfriend is encroaching on family dynamics by being too familiar. The author's response was direct but perhaps a bit harsh. However, given the boyfriend's behavior, the author might feel justified in being protective.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has the right to set personal boundaries, especially if they feel the boyfriend's presence is uncomfortable. On the other hand, the boyfriend might have been trying to integrate into the family, which can be a sensitive area. The sister might feel that her partner is being disrespected by the author's comment. \n\nIs the author wrong for expressing their discomfort? The author isn't in a position to control the sister's dating choices, but they can manage their own interactions. The author's comment was direct, but it's their right to communicate their feelings. However, maybe there's a more constructive way to handle it, like talking to the sister first about the concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nBut the author did mention they had kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend's behavior (showing up uninvited, being overly familiar) might have crossed a line. The author's response was a way to assert their boundaries, which is valid. The sister's reaction (not talking to the author) could be due to feeling that her partner is being judged, not that the author was wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the approach might have been abrupt. However, given the context of the boyfriend's risky behavior and the author's protective instincts, it's a nuanced situation. The main issue is whether the author overstepped. Since the author isn't in a direct relationship with the boyfriend, their role is to protect their sister and their own comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're within their rights to set boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's behavior. However, there might be room for a more diplomatic approach, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
