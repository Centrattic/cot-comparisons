My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not \"family\" after some concerning behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author finds him to be a poor choice, citing dangerous actions like drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a known ex-felon. The boyfriend has been trying to integrate into the author's life, showing up unannounced, being overly familiar, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're protecting their sister from a potentially harmful relationship. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line. The author's action was to set a boundary, which might have been necessary given the risks involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and build relationships with the sister's family. The author's direct approach might have come off as harsh, especially since the sister is the one in control of her dating choices. The sister's silence now might be due to feeling that the author overstepped, even if the intentions were good.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's actions were genuinely dangerous and the author felt the need to intervene for their sister's safety, then the action was justified. However, the method of confrontation could have been handled more sensitively. Telling someone they're not family in such a direct manner, without perhaps discussing it with the sister first, might have caused more harm by straining the relationship between the author and the sister.\n\nBut if the author's primary concern was the sister's well-being and they felt the boyfriend's presence was a threat, then their actions were an attempt to protect her. The key points are the boyfriend's dangerous behavior and the author's right to set boundaries. However, the author should consider whether they had the sister's consent to address the boyfriend directly. Since the sister is the one in the relationship, the author might have overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be noble, the approach could be seen as overstepping. They might have been in the wrong for not involving their sister in the decision to confront the boyfriend. The answer hinges on whether the intervention was appropriate given the circumstances. Given that the boyfriend's actions were risky and the author's concern was valid, but the method might have been abrupt, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the author's main goal was to protect their sister, perhaps they're not in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
