My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer confronting their sister's boyfriend about calling him \"family\" and other behaviors.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The writer disapproves of him, citing his age, dangerous actions (drunk driving, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs), and the fact that he's getting too close by visiting the writer and calling him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The writer told the boyfriend he's not family, leading to the sister not talking to the writer since.\n\nNow, analyzing if the writer is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are indeed concerning\u2014drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a known felon to purchase drugs (which might be illegal). The writer has valid concerns for their sister's safety. However, the issue here is the writer's approach. By directly confronting the boyfriend, the writer might have overstepped. The sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner, even if family members disagree. The writer's actions could have been perceived as disrespectful to the boyfriend and dismissive of the sister's choice, leading to the sister cutting off communication.\n\nThe writer's intention was to set a boundary, which is understandable, but the method might be problematic. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe a more diplomatic approach, like discussing with the sister privately, would have been better. However, the boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly familiar could justify the writer wanting to set a boundary. The writer isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for their sister's safety. But there's a line between concern and overstepping, especially in someone else's relationship.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the confrontation was justified given the boyfriend's actions. Since the boyfriend's behavior was risky and the writer was trying to protect their sister, the writer's actions might be seen as justified. However, the manner in which they addressed it could be seen as harsh. But considering the context, the writer is not in the wrong because they're acting from a place of concern and the boyfriend's actions are indeed concerning.\n"
