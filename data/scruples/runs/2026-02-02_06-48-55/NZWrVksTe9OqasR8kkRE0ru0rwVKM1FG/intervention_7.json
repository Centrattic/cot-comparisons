My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014driving drunk with her in the car and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating.\n\nThe author decided to confront him directly, stating he's not family. The key points here are the author's right to set boundaries versus the sister's autonomy in her relationship. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping if they didn't first talk to their sister. However, the boyfriend's actions could genuinely be concerning for the sister's safety. The author's intention was to set a boundary, but the method might be harsh. \n\nI need to consider if confronting the boyfriend without the sister's knowledge was appropriate. The sister might feel that her partner was unfairly judged by her sibling. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior does pose risks, so the author has valid concerns. The answer depends on whether the approach was respectful and if there's a better way to handle it. The author's right to express their discomfort but not to dictate the sister's choices. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. Maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the boyfriend's actions are questionable, but the way they addressed it could be problematic. However, given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong because they expressed their feelings directly, even if it upset their sister. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with their sister first. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but the situation is more nuanced. The answer hinges on whether direct confrontation without consulting the sister is justified. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning, so the author's actions might be protective. So, the author may not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
