My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some key points: the sister has been dating the guy for under three months, he's young, made some dangerous choices (drunk driving with her, associating with a known ex-felon), and the author felt he was being too familiar, calling him brother and family.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that the boyfriend's actions are concerning and they wanted to set boundaries. They mention the guy's risky behavior, which could harm their sister. The author kept their opinions to themselves initially, respecting her choice, but when the boyfriend started acting like family, they felt compelled to speak up.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by calling him out. The author's intention was to clarify that the boyfriend isn't family, possibly to prevent him from getting too close. The sister hasn't been in contact since, which might indicate some conflict, but the author's concern for their sister's safety is valid. \n\nHowever, the author could have chosen a more tactful approach. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe discussing the boyfriend's behavior with the sister privately first would have been better. But the author did mention the sister made her own choices, so they might have felt it was necessary to step in to protect her from potential harm.\n\nConsidering the boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving and associating with a dangerous person\u2014it's understandable that the author is worried. The author's comment about not being family might have been harsh, but their underlying concern is for their sister's well-being. \n\nSo, while the approach might have been abrupt, the intention was protective. The answer might hinge on whether the method of communication was appropriate. If the author had a right to be concerned about their sister's safety, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they addressed it could have been more diplomatic. Since the question is about being in the wrong, I think the author isn't in the wrong because their actions were driven by concern for their sister, even if the delivery was harsh. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
