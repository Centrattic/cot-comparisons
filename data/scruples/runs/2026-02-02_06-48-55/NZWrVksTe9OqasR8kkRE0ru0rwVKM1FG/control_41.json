My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has been with her for under three months. The author has concerns about the guy's actions\u2014driving drunk with her sister, hanging out with a known ex-felon, and potentially getting her involved in buying drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"family,\" which the author found inappropriate. They confronted him, leading to some tension with the sister.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the confrontation about the term \"family.\" The author's main issue is that the boyfriend is encroaching on family roles despite the short relationship and questionable behavior. The question is whether the author overstepped by directly telling him he's not family.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be concerned about their sister's well-being. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author might feel protective. On the other hand, the author is the sister's sibling, so they might feel it's their duty to look out for her. However, telling someone they're not family could come off as harsh, especially if the sister is still choosing to be with him. The boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the family, which is normal, but the author's reaction might have been abrupt without considering the sister's perspective.\n\nBut the author mentions that the sister hasn't been in contact since the confrontation, which suggests the sister might be upset. The author's action was direct, but given the safety concerns, maybe they were justified. It's a balance between protecting their sister and respecting her autonomy in her relationship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for partners to want to integrate into each other's families, but the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior might make their reaction understandable. The key is whether the author had the right to intervene. Since the sister is an adult making her own choices, the author's approach might have been too confrontational, but their intentions are protective. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. If the author's main issue was safety, they have valid reasons. But the way they addressed it might have been harsh. However, considering the dangerous behavior of the boyfriend, the author's actions could be seen as necessary to set boundaries. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
