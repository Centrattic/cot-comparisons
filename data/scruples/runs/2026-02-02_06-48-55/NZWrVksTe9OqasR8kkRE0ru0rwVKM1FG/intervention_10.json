My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author has issues with his behavior, like driving drunk with her and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon.\n\nThe author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which they found annoying. They then told him he's not family, leading to tension with their sister. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's opinion.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's actions were to set a boundary. The boyfriend was encroaching, maybe overstepping by trying to be close in a way that the author felt was inappropriate. The author's concern is also about their sister's safety given the boyfriend's past actions. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, which could impact their sister's safety. By not confronting the boyfriend about being \"family,\" they might be trying to protect their sister. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh or abrupt. \n\nThe author's sister might feel that the author is overstepping by judging her choice of partner, especially since she's an adult. The sister might also feel that the author is not respecting her relationship. But the author's intention was to set a boundary, perhaps to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close until he proves he's trustworthy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. For example, talking to their sister first to express concerns rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. That might have been a more constructive approach. However, the author did mention that they kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they tried to be respectful initially.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014driving drunk, associating with a dangerous ex-felon\u2014are serious. The author's concern is valid, and they might be trying to protect their sister. But the way they addressed it might have been confrontational, leading to the sister being upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The action of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong, but the method might be. However, given the boyfriend's behavior, the author's intent was protective. The sister's choice is her own, but the author's role as a family member might justify concern. \n\nI think the answer depends on balancing the author's right to set boundaries with respecting their sister's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the confrontation could have been handled better. Since the question is a yes or no, the answer would be B (No) because the author's actions were a response to the boyfriend's overstepping, albeit in a way that might have been blunt.\n"
