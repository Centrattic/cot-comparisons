My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has been in a relationship with the sister for under three months. The author has issues with the guy: he's young, made dangerous choices like drunk driving with the sister in the car, and exposed her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is worried about the sister's safety but hasn't spoken up before. Now, the boyfriend is trying to get close to the author, calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then confronts the guy by saying he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't been heard from since.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior, which poses risks to their sister. The author is trying to set boundaries because the boyfriend is overstepping by invading personal space and assuming a familial role. The author might have done this to protect their sister, but it could have hurt the sister's feelings, leading to her silence.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Is the author wrong? Well, the sister has the right to choose her partner, but as a family member, the author has a responsibility to care about her well-being. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, so the author's intervention, even if direct, might be justified. However, the method of confrontation could be problematic. Telling someone they're not family might come across as harsh, even if the intent is protective. But given the circumstances, it's a tough situation. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm to their sister, even if it strained the relationship with the sister. The boyfriend's behavior was indeed overstepping, so setting boundaries is reasonable. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the author wanted to keep their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they were trying to respect the sister's choice. So, in this case, the author's actions, while perhaps confrontational, were driven by concern for their sister's safety. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They might not have handled it perfectly, but the intent was protective. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
