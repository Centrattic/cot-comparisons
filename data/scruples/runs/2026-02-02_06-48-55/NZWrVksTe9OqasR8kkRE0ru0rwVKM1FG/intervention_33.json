My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author doesn't like him, thinks he's making dangerous choices\u2014drunk driving with the sister and hanging around a known ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves, but when the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam\" and showing up uninvited, the author snapped and said, \"You're not my family.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their sister's safety and is trying to protect her. The boyfriend's actions are clearly risky, and the author is justified in being worried. However, the author's approach might have been too harsh. The sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner, even if the author disagrees. The author's direct confrontation might have come across as dismissive or disrespectful, potentially pushing the sister away and causing her to stop communicating. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior in trying to bond with the family is understandable, but maybe he overstepped by assuming too quickly that the author would accept him as family. The author felt that the boyfriend was encroaching on their personal space and boundaries, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the main issue is whether confronting the boyfriend directly was the right move. The author might have wanted to address the boyfriend's behavior to set boundaries, which is okay, but the way they did it might have been too confrontational. Maybe a more diplomatic approach would have been better, like talking to the sister first or addressing the specific behaviors rather than the relationship itself.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction is important. If she hasn't spoken to the author since, it could indicate that the author's approach hurt her feelings or made her defensive. The author's intention was to protect the sister, but the method might have backfired. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, it's common for siblings to have different relationships with their partners. The author isn't legally or necessarily emotionally bound to accept the boyfriend as family, but the way they communicated their disapproval could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, the author's concern is valid, but the method of addressing it might be questionable. They might be in the right in wanting to protect their sister but in the wrong in how they handled the situation. However, sometimes directness is necessary when there's a safety concern. \n\nI need to weigh the intentions versus the actions. The author's intention was to set boundaries and protect the sister, but the execution might have been too abrupt. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family expectations. In some cases, being direct is seen as necessary, while in others, it's considered rude.\n\nGiven the boyfriend's risky behavior, the author's concern is justified. However, confronting the boyfriend directly without perhaps discussing it with the sister first could be seen as overstepping. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect their sister, but their approach could be seen as harsh. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could be either way. But the user is leaning towards AITA, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author had valid concerns and was setting boundaries, even if the method was a bit abrupt.\n"
