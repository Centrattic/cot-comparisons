My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister's boyfriend, telling him he's not family. The key points here are the underlying issues and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has done some risky things. He wrecked a truck while drunk with her in it and involved her with a known ex-felon. These are serious red flags. The author is worried about their sister's safety and has kept quiet until now. The boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and overstepping. \n\nThe author then directly told the boyfriend he's not family, which might have been abrupt. The question is whether that was wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the boyfriend is too close. But on the other hand, maybe there was a better way to handle it without making the sister upset. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving and associating with a dangerous person\u2014the author's concern is valid. The confrontation might have been harsh, but the intent was to protect their sister. The sister's choice to date him is her decision, but the author isn't wrong for expressing concern, especially given the risks involved. \n\nThe main issue is whether telling someone they're not family is crossing a line. If the boyfriend was seeking family approval, the author's refusal to accept him as family is a boundary. However, the method of confrontation could be problematic. But given the context of the boyfriend's behavior, the author's actions might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their intent was to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if the approach could have been smoother. The boyfriend's actions were concerning, so the author's response is understandable.\n"
