My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author doesn't like the boyfriend because of some dangerous actions he's taken, like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now but got annoyed when the boyfriend started treating them like family by calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The main issue here is whether telling someone they're not family is crossing a line. The author's intention was to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was encroaching too much. But was that the right approach?\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior was seeking closeness by using familial terms. The author might feel that this is inappropriate given the short duration of the relationship and the boyfriend's questionable actions. However, the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly and bond with the sister's family. The author's response was direct, which might have come off as harsh, especially since it's the sister's choice who she dates. The author is not in a position to dictate the sister's relationships but can express concern.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author overstepped. The author didn't confront the sister first, which might have been a better approach. Instead, they addressed the boyfriend directly, leading to potential conflict with the sister. The author might be justified in setting boundaries for themselves, but the method could have been more tactful. However, the boyfriend's actions are concerning for the sister's safety, so the author might be motivated by worry for her well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in a position to control the relationship, but they can express their disapproval of the boyfriend's behavior. Telling the boyfriend he's not family might be seen as a boundary, but it's possible that the sister feels her partner was unfairly targeted. The author might have been better off discussing their concerns with the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on whether the author had the right to set that boundary. Since the author is the sister's sibling, they have a right to be concerned about her safety. However, the direct confrontation without involving the sister first might have been inappropriate. But the act of setting a personal boundary by stating that the boyfriend isn't family could be seen as reasonable, though the method could be improved. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The answer is B (No), because the author is setting a boundary to protect their sister and themselves, even if the approach was rough.\n"
