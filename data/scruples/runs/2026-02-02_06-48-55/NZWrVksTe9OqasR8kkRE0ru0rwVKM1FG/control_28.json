My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months, and the author has some issues with him\u2014like the guy driving drunk with the sister in the car, associating with a scary ex-felon, and making dangerous choices. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up a lot and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The author's main concern is the safety and well-being of their sister, given the boyfriend's reckless behavior. They've been trying to stay out of their sister's dating life, which is a valid approach since it's her choice. However, the boyfriend's actions have crossed into areas that could be dangerous. The author's action of correcting the boyfriend's use of \"family\" seems like a boundary-setting moment. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly familiar might have crossed a line. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, the author is a family member who cares about their sister. Even though the boyfriend is not their family, the author's intent was to establish boundaries to protect their sister's well-being. The author's words could be seen as harsh, but the context of the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposure to dangerous individuals) adds a layer of concern for safety. The sister's lack of communication afterward might indicate that the author's approach upset her, but the core issue is about safety. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because they were addressing potential risks and setting personal boundaries. However, the way it was communicated could have been more diplomatic. But given the circumstances, the author's actions were motivated by concern for their sister's safety and their own need to maintain boundaries. The boyfriend's insistence on being considered family despite the short relationship and the author's disapproval could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
