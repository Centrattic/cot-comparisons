My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not \"family,\" after some concerning behavior by the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The sister has been dating the guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot, mainly because he's young and made dangerous choices\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging around a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating. The author then told him he's not family, leading to the sister not responding since.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's actions: confronting the boyfriend about his behavior and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's actions: unsafe choices, intruding on the author's space, using familial terms.\n\nThe author's motivations are concern for their sister's safety and setting personal boundaries. They acknowledge it's the sister's choice who she dates, so they didn't interfere earlier. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts acting like family without being invited into that role. The author's statement was a direct boundary, which is a common way to handle such situations.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the author overstepping? The boyfriend was trying to bond with the family, which is normal, but the author felt it was insincere or too soon. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) are valid safety concerns. The author's statement might have been harsh, but it's a way to communicate boundaries. The sister's reaction isn't clear, but the author might have hurt her feelings by confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action taken was reasonable given the circumstances. Here, the author had legitimate concerns about safety and personal space. Confronting the boyfriend directly might not be the best approach, but it's not uncommon for people to feel defensive. The author isn't forbidding the relationship but is asserting their own boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author's concerns are valid.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have talked to the sister first instead of the boyfriend. However, the author did keep opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up unannounced and being overly familiar is the trigger. The author's response is a way to stop that. It's a direct but maybe abrupt way to set boundaries.\n\nIn many AITA cases, setting boundaries isn't considered wrong, especially when there are safety issues involved. The author isn't trying to break up the relationship but is addressing their personal discomfort and safety concerns. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
