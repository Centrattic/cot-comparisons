My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the key points: The sister's boyfriend has made dangerous choices, like driving drunk with her in the car and exposing her to a known ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now but was annoyed by the boyfriend's behavior, especially him calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and showing up uninvited. The author then told him he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions, the author is concerned about their sister's safety. Even though the author respects her choice to date him, the boyfriend's behavior is risky. The author's main issue is the boyfriend overstepping by trying to be part of the family. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their sister and setting boundaries, which is reasonable given the dangers. On the other hand, the author's sister chose to date this person, and the author might have overstepped by confronting the boyfriend directly without discussing it with their sister first. However, the boyfriend's actions did seem to push the author's buttons, making the confrontation necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it seems the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing a legitimate concern about their sister's safety and the boyfriend's overreach. The sister's autonomy is respected, but the author is also allowed to set boundaries regarding their own relationship with the boyfriend.\n"
