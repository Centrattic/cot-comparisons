My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The boyfriend did things like drinking and driving with the sister, hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs, and then started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt that the boyfriend was getting too close and decided to set a boundary by saying he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about their sister's safety because of the boyfriend's actions. That's a valid concern. It's their responsibility as a sibling to look out for their sister. The boyfriend's behavior is definitely risky, so the author has good reason to be worried.\n\nNow, the question is whether telling the boyfriend he's not family is crossing a line. The author kept their opinions to themselves until now, so maybe they felt it was time to address the situation. The boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the family, which is normal, but the author is setting a boundary. \n\nDoes the author have the right to set that boundary? Well, they are part of the family, so they can decide how much interaction they're comfortable with. However, the boyfriend might feel this was harsh or unnecessary, especially since the sister is choosing to date him. The author's sister might be upset because they didn't talk to her first. \n\nBut the key points are the danger the boyfriend posed to the sister and the author's right to protect their sister. The author is not in control of their sister's choices, but they can express their concerns. By directly addressing the boyfriend, maybe the author wanted to make it clear that he's not part of the family, which could be a way to distance him from their sister. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have talked to their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. That might have been a better approach to avoid conflict and ensure their message is heard without causing tension. However, the situation involves serious safety issues, so the urgency to act might justify the direct approach.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention was to protect their sister and set a boundary. While the method might have been abrupt, the underlying concern is valid. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other perspective. The boyfriend was trying to be friendly, but the author had legitimate reasons to be cautious. The sister's choice to date him is her right, but the author's role is to voice concerns. \n\nI think the main issue is the method of communication. The author could have handled it differently, but the core of their concern isn't wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
