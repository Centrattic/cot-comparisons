My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation is that the sister is dating someone they think is an idiot and has made dangerous choices. The author kept their opinions to themselves but got annoyed when the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" Then they told him he's not family, leading to their sister being upset and not contacting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister is in a relationship, and the boyfriend is trying to be part of her family. The author's sister is the one in the relationship, so the boyfriend is part of her life. The author is her sibling, so they have a close relationship. The problem arises when the author feels the boyfriend is overstepping by calling him \"family,\" even though they're not.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's feelings about the boyfriend, the boyfriend's actions (like showing up unannounced and being overly familiar), and the author's response. The author says they kept their opinions to themselves until now, which might be a point in their favor. But then, when the boyfriend started acting like family, the author confronted him. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is the sibling, so they have a right to be protective. However, the way they addressed it might be an issue. The boyfriend was trying to bond, which is common, but the author might have been too direct or harsh. But considering the dangerous behavior of the boyfriend, the author's concern is valid. However, the main issue is the term \"family.\" The author might not want the boyfriend to feel like an accepted family member, especially given the issues with the ex-felon and drunk driving. \n\nBut the sister's relationship is her choice, and the author's message might have come off as dismissive or condescending. The boyfriend could have felt rejected, which might have affected the sister. The author did say \"you're the guy my sister is dating for now,\" which implies that the relationship is temporary. That might have been a harsh way to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their right to express discomfort with the boyfriend's familiarity. The boyfriend's actions (showing up uninvited, clinging during visits) could be seen as overstepping, so the author's response is a way to correct that. However, perhaps the author could have approached it more gently, like talking to the sister first or being more diplomatic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to set a boundary, which is okay. But the method might have been too direct, leading to the sister being upset. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could be questioned. The answer would be B, not in the wrong, because they're asserting their boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's questionable actions. However, it's important to consider the sister's perspective and the impact on the relationship. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach. So, the author's action was a response to overfamiliarity and potentially dangerous associations, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
