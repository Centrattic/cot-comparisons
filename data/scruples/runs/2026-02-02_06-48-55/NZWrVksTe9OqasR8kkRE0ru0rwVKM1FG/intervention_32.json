My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy's behavior\u2014like driving drunk with the sister, hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon, and buying drugs. The author kept their opinions to themselves but got annoyed when the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up unannounced.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concerns are valid safety issues\u2014drunk driving and exposure to a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend's behavior is indeed risky. The author is protecting their sister, which is a natural instinct. However, the author's approach was to confront the boyfriend directly, which might have been harsh. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, indicating possible conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be concerned about their sister's safety. On the other, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly stating the boyfriend isn't family\u2014might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful. The boyfriend was trying to bond, which is normal, but the author felt it was intrusive. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as necessary to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend was overstepping. However, the method might have been too abrupt. The author might have been right to express their discomfort but could have done so more gently. But since the situation involves safety, the urgency might justify a direct approach.\n\nConsidering that the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, the author's concern isn't without merit. The key issue is whether the author had the right to address it this way. Since the sister is the one in a relationship, the author might not be the best person to intervene directly. However, the author's role as a protective sibling is valid. The confrontation might have been necessary to prevent further inappropriate behavior, even if it upset the sister. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were protective, but the method could have been better. However, given the potential risks the boyfriend poses, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were acting out of concern for their sister's safety and setting boundaries to prevent a potentially dangerous relationship from progressing. The sister's reaction might be due to feeling that her choice was disrespected, but the author's actions were a form of intervention to protect her.\n"
