My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation is that the sister has been dating this guy for less than three months, and the author has concerns about his behavior\u2014he drove drunk with her sister in the car and was around someone with a felony. The author felt the boyfriend was overstepping by calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" so they told him he's not family. The sister hasn't spoken since, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern is the boyfriend's actions, which are risky and possibly dangerous. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is a valid reason. However, the author chose to directly tell the boyfriend that he's not family, which might have come off as harsh or dismissive. \n\nThe boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the family, which is common in many cultures. But the author's sister is the one who should be the mediator here. The author didn't confront the boyfriend about the dangerous behaviors first but instead focused on the term \"family,\" which could be seen as cutting off the boyfriend without addressing the real issues. \n\nAlso, the author's personal feelings toward the boyfriend are negative, but since he's the sister's partner, the sister has the autonomy to make her own choices. The author's intervention might have been premature or not the right approach. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend, maybe discussing it with their sister first would have been more appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. If the boyfriend was overstepping by showing up unannounced and being overly familiar, the author had the right to address that. The term \"family\" can be a sensitive one, so the author's reaction is understandable. But the way it was handled might have been too direct, leading to the sister's anger. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent to protect their sister is valid, but the method of confrontation was possibly impolite and could have been handled better. The boyfriend was trying to be friendly, but the author's sister might not have communicated the boundaries to him. The author's action isn't entirely wrong, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. If the author's actions were meant to set a boundary without being confrontational, maybe not. However, the approach was direct and might have been too harsh given the short duration of the relationship and the fact that the sister's boyfriend is her choice. The author could have expressed concerns privately to the sister first. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the method could be improved. The boyfriend's behavior was a bit overstepping, so the author had a reason to address it. However, the use of the term \"family\" could have been more tactful. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. Let me check if there's any cultural context I'm missing. Using \"brother\" and \"fam\" might be a stretch, but the author's sister might not have discussed boundaries with him. The author's action was a reality check, but perhaps it should have been done through the sister first. Still, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the boyfriend's actions were concerning.\n"
