My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some dangerous behavior by the boyfriend, like drunk driving with the sister and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves at first, but when the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" they decided to confront him.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the boyfriend's actions versus the author's response. The boyfriend's actions are definitely concerning, but the author is respecting their sister's choice by not interfering otherwise. However, when the boyfriend starts acting like part of the family, the author steps in. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is risky, so the author has valid concerns. But the way they addressed it might have been abrupt. The author could have approached the sister first to express their worries before confronting the boyfriend directly. By doing it directly, they might have hurt their sister's feelings and caused a rift. \n\nBut on the other hand, the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author is trying to protect their sister. Maybe the method was a bit harsh, but the intent is protective. The line between being a concerned sibling and overstepping can be thin here. However, given the boyfriend's risky behavior, the author's intervention might be justified. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had a reason to be concerned, and the situation warrants addressing. But the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's actions are problematic, the author's response, while maybe not the best way, isn't necessarily wrong. So I think the answer is B (No).\n"
