My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation is that the sister has been dating this guy for less than three months, and the author has some issues with him. The boyfriend did some dangerous things like driving drunk with her in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up at their apartment and being overly familiar, even calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister is in a relationship, and the boyfriend is making efforts to bond with the family. The author is concerned about his dangerous behavior, which is a valid safety issue. However, the author chose to tell the boyfriend directly that he's not family. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the method used. The author's concern is justified because the boyfriend's actions are risky. But the way they addressed it might be a problem. By saying \"You're not my family,\" the author could come off as dismissive or rude, even if their sister is the one in charge of the relationship. The boyfriend might have felt that his efforts to build a relationship with the family were being rejected, which could lead to hurt feelings. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the boyfriend is overstepping. The phrase \"You're not my family\" might be a bit harsh, but the underlying reason\u2014safety concerns\u2014could make it understandable. The sister's reaction is important too. If the author's sister was upset, that might indicate that the approach was too direct. But if the boyfriend was indeed being pushy, maybe the author had to set that boundary. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the communication style. Even with valid concerns, the way it was delivered might not be respectful. The author could have addressed the behavior without directly cutting off the boyfriend. For example, explaining the boundaries in a more constructive way instead of stating he's not family. \n\nBut the author's intention was to prevent the boyfriend from overstepping, and they were trying to keep their opinions to themselves. They might not have wanted to interfere, but when the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and being overly familiar, the author felt the need to act. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions were based on safety concerns and setting boundaries. However, the method could be improved. But since the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach, the author's actions are justified.\n"
