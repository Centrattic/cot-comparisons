My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author thinks the guy is making dangerous choices, like driving drunk with her sister in the car and getting her involved with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about her sister's safety but hasn't spoken up until now because it's her sister's choice who she dates.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and using \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. The author then told him he's not family, just the guy she's dating. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, and the author is now questioning if they were wrong to say that.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's intentions and actions. The author's concern is safety, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author is trying to protect their sister. However, the way the author chose to express their concerns was to tell the boyfriend he's not family. \n\nIs that the right approach? Well, the author didn't confront the sister first or express their concerns to her in private. They directly told the boyfriend, which might have been abrupt and hurtful. But the author's motivation is to protect their sister. The boyfriend was also being overly familiar, which the author found annoying and inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author has a valid concern about safety but chose a direct approach that might have been hurtful to the sister and the boyfriend. However, the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to protect their sister. On the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nBut in the context of the question, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making that statement. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author had a justified concern and the boyfriend was being too familiar, the author's statement, while harsh, was to set boundaries. So the answer might be B (no), but I need to be careful here. The author's actions might not be in the wrong because their intention was to protect their sister, even if the method wasn't the best. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer could depend on cultural norms or personal views on family dynamics. Generally, though, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up to protect their sister, even if the approach was direct.\n"
