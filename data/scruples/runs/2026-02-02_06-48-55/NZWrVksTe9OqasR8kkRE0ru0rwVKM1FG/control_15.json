My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family after some concerning behavior. \n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. He's made some dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about his sister's safety but hasn't said much before. Now, the boyfriend has started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" visiting their apartment, and being overly familiar.\n\nThe key points here are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the boyfriend's overstepping boundaries. The author's comment about not being family might have been a way to set a boundary, especially since the boyfriend's actions have been problematic. But the question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is reacting to the boyfriend's behavior, which is indeed concerning. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author has a right to be protective of their sister. On the other hand, the author's sister is in the relationship, so the boyfriend might feel he has a right to interact with the family. However, the author's comment about not being family could come across as dismissive or harsh, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly.\n\nBut the underlying issue is the boyfriend's dangerous behavior. The author's main issue isn't just the term \"family,\" but the boyfriend's actions. By setting that boundary, the author is highlighting that the relationship isn't as close as the boyfriend might think, given the short time and the red flags. The sister might be upset because the author intervened, but the author's priority is her safety. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were trying to protect their sister from someone who's made bad decisions. The comment about not being family was a way to establish distance, which is reasonable given the circumstances. The boyfriend's overstepping (calling them family, showing up uninvited) also contributed to the situation. The author's action was a response to both the boyfriend's behavior and the inherent risks. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
