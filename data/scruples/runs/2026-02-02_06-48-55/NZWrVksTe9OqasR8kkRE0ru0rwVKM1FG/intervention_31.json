My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating a guy under three months, and the author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving with her, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author.\n\nThe author decided to confront him by saying he's not family, which led to the sister not contacting them since. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's intent: they wanted to set boundaries because the boyfriend was being too familiar. The author's concern about the boyfriend's behavior is valid, but how they addressed it might be the issue. Directly stating that the boyfriend isn't family could come off as harsh, especially considering the sister's choice in partners. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first or addressing the dangerous behaviors instead of focusing on the familial terms.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a felon) are serious. The author could have expressed concern about those behaviors more directly. By focusing on the \"family\" label, the author might have missed addressing the real risks. However, the author also has the right to set personal boundaries. The confrontation might be seen as necessary to prevent the boyfriend from overstepping, but the method could be questioned. The key points are the safety concerns and the approach taken. The answer hinges on whether the author had the right to set that boundary directly without involving the sister first, or if the approach was too abrupt. Considering all, the author's intent was to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if the method was blunt. So, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
