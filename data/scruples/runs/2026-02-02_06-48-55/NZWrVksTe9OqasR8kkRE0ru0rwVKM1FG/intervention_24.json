My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot, though they acknowledge he's young. The main issues are that the boyfriend drove drunk with the sister in the car, took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs, and has been showing up at the author's apartment and acting too familiar, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally told him he's not family, which led to the sister not talking to them since.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's intentions. They care about their sister and are worried about her safety, given the dangerous situations the boyfriend put her in. They tried to stay out of it initially, only speaking up when the boyfriend started acting like part of the family. The confrontation was direct, telling the boyfriend he's not family. The author might have felt it was necessary to set boundaries to protect their sister and themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and integrate into the sister's family, which is common in relationships. The sister hasn't communicated since, so maybe she's upset that her partner was dismissed by family. The author's approach might have been harsh, especially since it's early in the relationship. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like talking to the sister first or addressing the behavior without the confrontational remark.\n\nBut the author's actions were to set a boundary, which is valid. They have a right to feel protective. However, the way they did it might have been too direct and could have been hurtful. The key points here are the safety concerns versus the method of addressing the relationship. Since the boyfriend's actions were dangerous, the author's concern is justified. However, publicly calling out the boyfriend in front of others (like at their mom's house) might not be the best approach. The author should have perhaps discussed their concerns with the sister first before confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nIn terms of the question, whether the author is in the wrong. They had valid reasons for concern, but the manner in which they addressed it might have been inappropriate. But sometimes, when someone is acting in a way that's invasive or overstepping, setting a clear boundary is necessary. The main issue is whether the method used was justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because protecting family and setting boundaries is understandable, even if the approach was direct. However, there's also a case for A if the confrontation was too aggressive without prior discussion with the sister. This is a bit of a gray area. But given the context of safety concerns and the need to set boundaries, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
