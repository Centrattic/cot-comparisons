My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author confronting their sister's boyfriend about being called \"family.\" The key points are the boyfriend's actions and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has done some risky things. He got into a drunk driving accident with the sister in the car and took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs. These are serious issues that could put the sister in danger. The author is concerned about the relationship but has kept their opinions to themselves until now. \n\nThen, the boyfriend starts showing up uninvited at the author's apartment and acts overly familiar, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author feels this is crossing a line, interpreting the familiarity as being mistaken for actual family. When the author tells the boyfriend he's not family, the boyfriend just says \"alright,\" and the author walks away. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's sister is an adult and can choose who she dates. The author might be overstepping by confronting the boyfriend. But on the other hand, the boyfriend's actions are dangerous and the author is trying to protect their sister. The author's comment about not being family could be seen as a boundary-setting action rather than an attack. The sister might be upset because the author criticized her choice, but if the boyfriend is indeed a bad influence, the author's concern is valid. \n\nHowever, the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh. Instead of confronting the boyfriend directly, maybe they should have talked to their sister first. By telling the boyfriend he's not family, the author might have made the sister feel like they're not supporting her choice, leading to the sister cutting off contact. \n\nBut given the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author's intention was to protect their sister. The line between protecting and overstepping can be blurry. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the boyfriend's actions are concerning. However, the method of confronting him might have been inappropriate. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to protect their sister from a potentially harmful situation. The response was a bit direct, but the intent was valid. So the answer is B.\n"
