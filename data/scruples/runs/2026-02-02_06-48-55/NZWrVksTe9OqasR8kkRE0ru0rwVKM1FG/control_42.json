My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for less than three months. The author isn't a fan of this guy, thinking he's an idiot and that he's made dangerous choices. Specifically, he wrecked his truck while drunk with her in it, and took her to meet an ex-felon to buy pot, which might be more dangerous. The author is worried about his sister's safety but hasn't said anything until now.\n\nThe guy starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited at their apartment, and attaching himself to the author when they visit their mom. The author then tells him directly that he's not family, just the guy his sister is dating. The sister hasn't responded since, so the author is worried about the fallout.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is the sister's safety. The guy has done dangerous things, so the author is worried. However, the sister is an adult and chooses who she dates. The author kept their opinions to themselves initially, which is respectful. But when the guy started trying to get close to the author, maybe overstepping boundaries by calling him family terms, the author had enough.\n\nThe key point here is the author's communication. Did they overstep by telling the guy he's not family? Well, the guy was being too familiar and maybe trying to ingratiate himself into the family, which the author found annoying and possibly a threat. The author's response was direct but not aggressive. They told him once and walked away. The sister's silence might be because she's upset with the author for confronting her boyfriend, especially since the relationship is still new.\n\nBut is the author wrong? The author was protecting their sister's family from a potentially dangerous situation. However, they could have handled it differently. Maybe talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But the author's intention was to set boundaries, which is understandable. The sister's choice to date him is her decision, but the author's concern for her safety is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the confrontation was appropriate. Since the author was trying to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if it upset the sister, they might not be in the wrong. But maybe they should have approached it differently. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for their actions. Since the guy was acting in a way that the author found intrusive and the author was trying to be clear about the relationship, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. However, given the context of the guy's dangerous behavior, the author's actions could be justified as protective. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
