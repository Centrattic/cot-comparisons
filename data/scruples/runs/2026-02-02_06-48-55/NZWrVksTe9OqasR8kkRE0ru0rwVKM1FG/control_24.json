My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is that the sister is dating someone for less than three months, and the brother has issues with the guy's behavior\u2014like drunk driving with her and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The brother kept his opinions to himself until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which upset him. Then he told the guy he's not family.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the brother's intentions. He's concerned about his sister's safety and well-being because of the boyfriend's dangerous actions. That seems valid. He's not trying to control his sister's choices, but he's worried about her. The boyfriend's behavior is risky, and the brother feels the need to set boundaries to protect his sister and himself.\n\nNext, the way the brother handled it. He directly told the boyfriend that he's not family. While confrontation can be tricky, the brother did this in a direct manner. The question is whether that was the right approach. The boyfriend might have felt disrespected or misunderstood, leading to the sister being upset. But the brother's main point was about setting a boundary, not attacking the boyfriend's character beyond stating the relationship status.\n\nAnother angle is the brother's role in the family. Siblings often have different approaches to their responsibilities. The brother might feel it's his duty to look out for his sister, especially when she's in a relationship that he perceives as risky. However, he did respect her choice to date the guy, which shows he's not being overbearing. His issue is more about the boyfriend's encroachment into his personal space and family dynamics.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of showing up uninvited and using familial terms might have crossed boundaries. The brother's response was to clarify his position, which is a form of boundary setting. Whether it's wrong depends on context. If the brother approached it with respect and concern, it might be justified. But if he was hostile or dismissive, that's another issue. The story doesn't mention hostility, just a clear statement of facts.\n\nThe outcome is that the sister hasn't responded since. The brother might have caused tension in his relationship with his sister, but the root issue is about protecting her and maintaining personal boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior was problematic, so the brother's reaction is a form of standing up for himself and his sister's family.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother acted out of concern for his sister and himself. While the method could have been more tactful, the intent was to set boundaries, which is a reasonable action. The boyfriend might have overstepped by assuming familiarity, and the brother correcting that isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as he's asserting his boundaries in a situation where the boyfriend's actions were concerning and intrusive.\n"
