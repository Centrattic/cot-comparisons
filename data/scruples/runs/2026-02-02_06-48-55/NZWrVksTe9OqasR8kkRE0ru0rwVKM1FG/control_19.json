My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The author's sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The guy has some questionable behavior: drunk driving with her in the car, hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs, etc. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly friendly, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told him directly he's not family.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions are concerning. Drunk driving and associating with a dangerous person are serious issues. The author is worried about their sister's safety, which is valid. The problem seems to be the boyfriend's overstepping in trying to be part of the family. The author's response was to set a boundary, which might have been abrupt, but given the context, it's a way to assert that the boyfriend isn't family. \n\nThe sister's autonomy in choosing her partner is important, but the author has a right to protect their own boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior (showing up unannounced, attaching himself to the author) could be seen as intrusive. The author's message might have been harsh, but it was a clear boundary. Whether it's wrong depends on whether the author overstepped in their own boundaries versus the boyfriend's actions. The author didn't attack the boyfriend's relationship but clarified their own familial boundaries. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the author's intent was to protect their family dynamics. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
