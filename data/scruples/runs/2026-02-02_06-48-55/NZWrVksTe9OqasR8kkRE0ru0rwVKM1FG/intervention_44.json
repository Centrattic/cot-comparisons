My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend is involved in some risky behavior\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, exposing her to a known ex-felon to get drugs. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and is clearly worried. But they've kept their opinions to themselves until this point, which shows restraint.\n\nThe issue now is the boyfriend's behavior: showing up uninvited, being overly familiar by calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The author confronts him directly, telling him he's not family. The key here is whether this confrontation was appropriate.\n\nThe author's actions might come off as harsh, but they're motivated by concern for their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are not just about being pushy; they involve actual danger. The author might feel that setting boundaries is necessary to protect their sister and themselves from an unsafe situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by rejecting the boyfriend so bluntly, even if their intentions are good. However, considering the boyfriend's risky behavior and the author's justified concern for their sister's well-being, the confrontation seems like a reasonable boundary setting. The author isn't attacking the relationship but addressing the boyfriend's specific behaviors and their own discomfort with his familiarity. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
