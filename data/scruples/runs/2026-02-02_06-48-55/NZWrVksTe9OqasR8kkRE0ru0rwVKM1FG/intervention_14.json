My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author hasn't voiced these concerns before, keeping their opinions to themselves. However, the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author's response was to directly tell him he's not family, which upset the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nSo, from a rights perspective, the sister has the right to choose her partner, and the boyfriend has the right to interact with her family, even if it's uncomfortable for the author. The author's concerns are valid regarding the boyfriend's actions being dangerous, but instead of addressing the actual behavior (like drunk driving or associating with a criminal), the author focused on the emotional boundary of being called family. \n\nThe author might have felt the need to set a boundary, but the method could be problematic. Directly confronting the boyfriend in that way without considering the sister's feelings or involving her might have been the wrong approach. The author didn't address the real issues but instead focused on the emotional aspect, which could have been more sensitively handled. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are concerning, but the author's response could have been more constructive. Maybe discussing their concerns with the sister first, rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. The sister might have already been aware of the issues or chosen to overlook them, so the author's intervention might have been seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend was trying to be friendly by getting close to the family, which is a common behavior, even if it's over the top. But given the dangerous behavior, there's a valid concern. However, the confrontation method might have been too harsh, leading to the sister being upset and the author being cut off.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intentions might be valid, but their approach was flawed. They had a right to express concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, but telling him he's not family in that direct manner without addressing the real issues could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
