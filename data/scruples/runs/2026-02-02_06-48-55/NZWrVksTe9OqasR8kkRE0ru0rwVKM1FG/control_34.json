My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating him for less than three months, and the author has some issues with him. The boyfriend did some risky things like drunk driving with the sister in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy pot. The author is worried about their sister's safety but hasn't said much until now.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then told him he's not family but just the guy their sister is dating. The sister hasn't talked to the author since, which the author acknowledges might have upset her.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are: the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior are valid. Drunk driving and associating with a dangerous person are serious issues. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is understandable. However, the way they addressed it was by telling the boyfriend he's not family. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's place to set boundaries with a partner that isn't their own? The boyfriend is in a relationship with their sister, so maybe the author should have discussed their concerns with their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. By telling the boyfriend he's not family, the author might have overstepped. It could come off as rude or dismissive, even if the intentions are good. \n\nThe boyfriend was just trying to be friendly and integrate into the family, but the author's response was harsh. The sister might feel that her partner is being criticized by her sibling, which could cause tension in their relationship. The author's action might have hurt the sister's feelings and damaged the relationship between them and their sister.\n\nSo, even though the author's concerns are legitimate, the approach might have been inappropriate. The better course of action would have been to talk to the sister about their worries and let her decide how to handle the situation with her partner. Confronting the boyfriend directly and using that kind of language could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting personal boundaries and for not addressing the issue through the appropriate channel, which is their sister.\n"
