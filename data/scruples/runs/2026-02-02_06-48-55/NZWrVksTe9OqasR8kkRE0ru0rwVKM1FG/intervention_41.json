My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the author disapproving of the boyfriend's behavior\u2014like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which led to the confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is the boyfriend making them feel included in the family despite the author's disapproval. The boyfriend's actions are indeed concerning, but the author is respecting their sister's choice in partners. However, when the boyfriend oversteps by being overly familiar and using family terms, the author confronts him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author probably felt that the boyfriend was intruding too much, especially given the boyfriend's questionable behavior. But was the confrontation handled appropriately? Telling someone they're not family might come off as harsh, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly. However, the context of the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) adds a layer of concern for the sister's safety.\n\nThe author might be justified in setting boundaries to protect their sister and themselves. However, the way they communicated it\u2014calling him out in a direct manner\u2014could have been more tactful. Maybe approaching the sister first to express concerns before confronting the boyfriend would have been better. But given that the author was polite and kept opinions to themselves until now, the directness might be a reaction to feeling that the boyfriend was overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have realized how his actions were perceived. He could be genuinely trying to connect with his girlfriend's family, which is common. The author's confrontation might have been necessary to establish boundaries but could have been done more diplomatically.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's intent was to protect their sister and set boundaries, but the method might have been confrontational. However, given the context of the boyfriend's dangerous behavior and the author's past restraint, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to protect their sister. However, the way they handled it could have been improved.\n"
