I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend, who's pregnant, wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's in the shared home. When he suggests his mom should also come for support, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: He's part of the shared home, so the decision to have someone stay should involve both of them. He's being dismissed when he asks for his own support. The girlfriend's perspective: She's pregnant and may feel the need for extra help and emotional support, which is common. She might not have considered that her partner also needs support, especially if he's taking on more responsibilities.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the author did raise a valid point about not being consulted. However, when he suggested his mom, he might have overstepped by not discussing it first, especially if it's a shared home. The girlfriend's response was harsh (\"asshole\"), which is unkind. The author expressing a need for support isn't unreasonable. Both parties have valid points. However, the key issue is communication. The girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision, which is a problem. But when he responds by suggesting his mom without prior discussion, that could also be seen as not considering her situation. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he's seeking support and the girlfriend's response was dismissive, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he is advocating for his needs, which is reasonable. But I need to check if his approach was wrong. Since he didn't discuss it first, maybe there's a balance here. But the initial problem is the girlfriend didn't consult him. So, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
