      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and her wanting her mom to stay for support. The author, the boyfriend, feels upset because she didn't consult him before inviting her mom. He then suggests inviting his mom too, but she responds negatively, implying he doesn't need support. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The main issue seems to be about communication and mutual decision-making in a shared home. The girlfriend made a decision about having her mother over without discussing it with her partner, which the author finds problematic. The author then tries to assert his own need for support by suggesting his mother come as well, but she dismisses that.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a partnership, especially when expecting a child, both partners' needs and feelings should be considered. The girlfriend's action of not consulting her partner might be seen as dismissive of his input in their shared living situation. On the other hand, the author's response might come across as a bit confrontational, using her own argument against her. However, his initial concern about being included in decisions affecting their home is valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" could imply a lack of recognition for his role in the impending parenthood. This could be a point where the author is justified in feeling undervalued. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend not discussing the move with her partner is a communication issue. The author, while asserting his needs, might have escalated the situation by mirroring her approach. However, his initial request for inclusion isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not entirely. The question is whether he's the asshole. If the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans and then dismissed his support needs, she's at fault. The author is standing up for himself, even if his method might not have been the best. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
