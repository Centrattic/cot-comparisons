I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before and after the birth. The author (the guy) is upset that she didn't ask him first because they share the home. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he responds by suggesting his mom should come too. She gets angry, calls him an asshole, and says he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and might be stressed, so seeking support from her mom makes sense. But the author feels left out of the decision since they live together. He's probably feeling that his input matters in their shared home. When he mentions his mom, she dismisses him, which could be hurtful.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting support? Well, support is important for both parents. The fact that she's focusing only on her own support might be the issue here. The author might feel that his needs are being ignored, especially since both parents are going through the birth and early parenting phase. Her reaction of calling him an asshole is harsh and invalidates his feelings. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or traditional aspect here where the mother of the pregnant woman is the primary support. However, in modern relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author's request for his mom to stay isn't unreasonable if he also needs support. The girlfriend's dismissal based on gendered assumptions (that he's not doing real work) is problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's reaction is more concerning here. The author's main issue is being excluded from a decision that affects their shared home and not being respected in his need for support. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
