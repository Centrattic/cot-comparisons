Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay for support. The author (the boyfriend) is upset that she didn't include him in the decision, especially since they live together. He brings up wanting his mom to stay too, and she gets angry, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he feels his opinion matters because they share the home. It's reasonable to want to discuss major changes like a family member moving in. On the other hand, the girlfriend is stressed about the upcoming birth and might be seeking comfort from her mom, which is a natural response. Her reaction of calling him an asshole is definitely harsh, but maybe she's overwhelmed.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The author didn't express his feelings clearly at first; he waited until after she made the decision. Then, when he did bring it up, he suggested his mom should stay too, which might have come off as dismissive of her real needs. Instead of addressing why he felt left out, he shifted the focus to his own needs, which might not be as critical. The girlfriend's response is extreme, but the author's approach could have been more collaborative. He might have benefited from acknowledging her need for support first before expressing his own concerns. So, while the girlfriend's response is wrong, the author's handling of the situation also contributes to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
