      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend expecting a child and wanting her mother to stay over for support. The author feels left out because he wasn't consulted and his suggestion to invite his mother was dismissed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Both partners are entering a major life event\u2014having a baby. Support from family is crucial, especially during pregnancy and after childbirth. The girlfriend's request for her mother to stay is understandable as she's going through physical and emotional changes. However, the author's point is about not being asked first and feeling excluded from the decision-making regarding their shared home.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't discuss the mother's visit with the author, which he found problematic. He then tried to reciprocate by suggesting his mother's visit but was met with resistance. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" could be seen as dismissive. While it's true that the physical burden of pregnancy is on the mother, the author's role in providing support and sharing responsibilities is also important. The girlfriend's reaction might be a reaction to stress, but it's not a valid reason to exclude him from decisions about their home.\n\nAnother angle is the shared nature of their home. Both partners have a right to input on who stays in their house, especially for extended periods. The fact that the girlfriend went ahead without discussing it first could be a breach of mutual decision-making. The author's request for his mother to stay is a reasonable attempt to balance support, and her response might come off as unfair or invalidating his needs.\n\nHowever, it's possible the girlfriend is overwhelmed and not handling stress well. Her initial request for support is valid, but her dismissal of the author's needs could be due to her own anxiety. The author's frustration is about being involved in the decision, which is reasonable. The problem might stem from a lack of communication rather than either party being inherently wrong. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to be consulted and for feeling that his support needs are important too.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for seeking support and wanting to be involved in decisions about their shared home. The girlfriend's response was inappropriate, and the author is justified in his reaction.\n"
