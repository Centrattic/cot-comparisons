      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who is pregnant, wants her mom to stay with them for several weeks. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first, and when he suggested his mom could also stay for support, she called him an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author feels that since they share the home, her decision to have her mother come over without discussing it with him is a problem. The girlfriend justifies it by saying her mom is her support. The author then counters by suggesting his mom should also come for support, but the girlfriend dismisses him, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. When making major decisions that affect a shared living space, both partners should be involved. The girlfriend didn't consult the author, which is a valid concern. However, the author's response\u2014wanting to bring in his own mother\u2014might be seen as a way to balance things, but it could also be perceived as a tit-for-tat reaction rather than addressing the initial problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of calling the author an asshole is clearly inappropriate, but the author's initial point about not being consulted is valid. The author is trying to assert that both partners' needs for support should be considered. The girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support is problematic because it's not just about physical labor; emotional and practical support is important for both partners during such a significant life change.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the situation seems to stem from a lack of communication and understanding. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be involved in decisions about their shared home. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh and invalidates his feelings. However, the author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by expressing his feelings without immediately suggesting his mother. But the core issue is that the girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision, which is a key aspect of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's advocating for mutual consideration in a shared living situation, and her response was unkind and dismissive.\n"
