      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the A-hole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for two weeks before the baby is due and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about inviting her mother into their shared home. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he then suggests inviting his mom as well. She responds by calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (likely referring to childbirth and the physical aspects of being a mother).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels his input was ignored regarding a significant decision about their shared living space. It's reasonable for him to expect to be part of the conversation when someone else is coming to live in their home for an extended period. On the other hand, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable time, pregnant, and seeking support from her family. Her reaction, however, seems dismissive and potentially belittling towards the author's role. She implies that his contributions are less important, which could be hurtful and undermine his involvement in the parenting process.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't consult the author, which is a valid concern in a shared living situation. However, the author's response of suggesting to bring in his own mother might be seen as a bit of a retort, possibly escalating the conflict. But his initial concern about not being included in the decision is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole and downplaying his role might indicate a lack of respect for his feelings and contributions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend should have discussed the living arrangements with her partner. The author's request for support is also valid, as partners often need emotional and practical support during such times. The girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support could be seen as invalidating his role in the pregnancy and impending parenthood. \n\nSo, considering that the author's main issue is being excluded from a major decision about their home, and the girlfriend's response being disrespectful, it seems like the girlfriend is in the wrong. However, the author's approach of using his mother as a counterpoint might not be the most effective way to address the issue. But the primary fault lies in the girlfriend not including him in the conversation and her condescending reply. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
