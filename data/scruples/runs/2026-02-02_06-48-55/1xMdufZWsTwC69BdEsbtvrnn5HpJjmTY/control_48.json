      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support before and after the baby arrives. The guy is upset because she didn't ask him first, and they share the home. He then suggests his mom should come too, but she says he's an asshole because he's not the one doing the \"real work\" of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main points are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend didn't consult her partner about her mom staying, which is a big decision since they live together. That's a valid concern. The guy's reaction is to suggest his mom come as well, which seems like a way to assert his need for support. But the girlfriend's response is harsh, calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, he did express his feelings and tried to find a solution by suggesting his mom. But maybe he could have approached it differently, like discussing his feelings of not being included rather than immediately suggesting his mom. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also extreme. She's not invalidating the need for support; childbirth and parenting are huge, and both partners need support. Her statement that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth is problematic. It's true that the physical labor is different, but emotional and practical support is important for both partners.\n\nThe key issue is communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with her partner first. The guy's response might be a bit reactive, but his point is valid. The question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his actions were reasonable. By pointing out he wants support too, he's highlighting a valid need, even if his method could be improved. The girlfriend's response is more aggressive and dismissive. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
