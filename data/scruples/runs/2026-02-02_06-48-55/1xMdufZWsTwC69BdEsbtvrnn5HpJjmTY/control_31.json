      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives, but she didn't consult her partner first. The partner feels left out and suggests his mom could come too, but she reacts negatively, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's request for support is understandable. Pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful, and having a mother nearby can help with physical and emotional support. However, the key issue here is that she didn't communicate this decision with her partner. Sharing a home means major decisions, especially those involving family, should be discussed together. \n\nThe partner's response is to suggest his own mother come as well, which is a reasonable reaction if he feels his input wasn't considered. But when the girlfriend dismisses his need for support and calls him an asshole, that's problematic. She's being dismissive of his feelings and not acknowledging that both partners might need support, even if their roles differ. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the partner) is in the wrong. The author wanted support, which is valid, but the way he reacted by suggesting his mother might come could be seen as a bit of a counterattack. However, the initial problem was her not including him in the decision. So, the main issue is her not consulting him first. The partner's response, while perhaps a bit defensive, is a reaction to being excluded. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The girlfriend's failure to discuss the living arrangement with her partner is a significant oversight. The partner is justified in feeling upset about being excluded, especially since it's their shared home. The girlfriend's response invalidating his need for support is unhelpful and could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The primary issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. The partner's request for support is reasonable, even if the method of bringing it up could be improved. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
