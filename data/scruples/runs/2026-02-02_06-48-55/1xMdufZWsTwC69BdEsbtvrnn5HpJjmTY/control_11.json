      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend has arranged for her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about this, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests inviting his mom too, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he won't be doing the actual work (presumably of childbirth). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expecting to have his mother stay as well, which makes sense if he wants support. However, the girlfriend is dismissive, implying that his role doesn't require the same level of support. That seems unfair because both parents would likely need support during such a stressful time. The author's main grievance is that he wasn't consulted about his own mother staying, even though they live in the same home. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is problematic because it devalues the author's need for support. Childbirth is a major life event, and both parents usually need help. By saying he doesn't need support, she's minimizing his role and contributions. The author's reaction is a reasonable pushback against that.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let's see. He brought up the issue because he wasn't consulted, which is valid. The girlfriend's response was harsh, which could indicate a deeper issue in their communication. The author's suggestion to invite his mother is logical, yet the girlfriend's reaction is to call him an asshole. That's not healthy conflict resolution.\n\nHowever, maybe there's something else. Did the author have a prior discussion about support? The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's mother is coming, and the author is upset about not being asked. The author's response is to propose his mother as well. The girlfriend's dismissal is the problem here. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The author wasn't consulted about his own home being occupied by the mother-in-law. 2. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and insulting. 3. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The author is asserting his right to have his needs addressed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
