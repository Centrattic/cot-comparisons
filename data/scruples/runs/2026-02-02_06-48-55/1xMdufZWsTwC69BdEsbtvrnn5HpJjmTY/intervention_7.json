      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend asked her mom to stay with them two weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he retorts by saying he'll invite his mom too. She then calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (presumably the pregnancy and childbirth part).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, the author is upset that the girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying. That's a valid point because they share the home, so both partners should have a say in who's coming into their living space. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly invalidating. She calls him an asshole and undermines his need for support, which isn't healthy. The author's reaction to suggest inviting his own mom is a reasonable response to feel supported equally. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? The initial problem is that the girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a communication issue. The author's response was to bring up his own mom, which could be a way to highlight the fairness of the situation. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. \n\nHowever, the author's main issue was not being consulted. The girlfriend's mom staying is a big deal, and excluding the partner from that decision is problematic. The author's desire for support is valid, especially since the arrival of a baby is a huge life change. Both partners need support, and the girlfriend's dismissal of the author's need for support is the issue here. \n\nSo the author isn't entirely wrong. He's in a position where his partner didn't communicate properly, and his response was to seek equal treatment. The girlfriend's reaction is more concerning here. The author's actions were in response to being shut down. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I should make sure I'm not missing something. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have discussed this with his girlfriend in a more constructive way instead of suggesting his mom. But the girlfriend's response was unnecessarily harsh, so the author's reaction is understandable given her tone. The main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend, and the author is standing up for his right to be included in decisions about their shared home. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
