      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay over for support. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about her mother staying, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she called him an asshole. The question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are shared living space, communication, and the sense of support. The girlfriend is pregnant and has been acting differently, which the author mentions as being a \"nightmare.\" She's inviting her mom to stay, which is a significant life change affecting their shared home. The author feels left out of the decision-making process. When he brings it up, he's met with hostility and invalidation.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. If one partner is making a decision that affects both, especially in a shared home, it's reasonable to expect discussion. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly unfair. She's asserting her need for support, which is valid, but not considering the other person's feelings or offering mutual support. The author's reaction\u2014wanting his mom's support\u2014could be seen as a way to balance things, but the girlfriend's reaction is harsh.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting support? Well, wanting support is normal, especially in a big life event like childbirth. The girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support might be the issue here. However, the author didn't explicitly ask for his mom to come; he suggested it after she dismissed his concern. The initial problem was her not discussing the decision with him. The author's request for his own support is a valid reaction to feeling excluded or not supported.\n\nSo, the main issues are lack of communication and the girlfriend's hostile response. The author's actions (suggesting his mom's support) are a reaction to her not including him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the problem lies more with the girlfriend's approach. The answer should be B (No).\n"
