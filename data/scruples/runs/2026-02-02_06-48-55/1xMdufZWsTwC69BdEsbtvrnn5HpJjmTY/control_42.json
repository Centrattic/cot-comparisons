I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives but feeling upset that his girlfriend arranged for her mom to stay without consulting him. He then suggests inviting his own mom, but she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. It's reasonable for him to want to be involved in such a big decision, especially since they live together. On the other hand, the girlfriend is pregnant and might feel the need for support from her mother, which is understandable. Her response was dismissive, which could be seen as invalidating his feelings. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author didn't act out of malice but expressed his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, calling him an asshole, which isn't constructive. The author's request for his mother to stay isn't about being difficult but about seeking equal support. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions affecting the household should be discussed together. The girlfriend didn't do that, which is a problem. The author's response was to propose a solution, which is fair. Her dismissal of his needs could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included and for suggesting his own support system. The main issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication and her condescending reply. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
