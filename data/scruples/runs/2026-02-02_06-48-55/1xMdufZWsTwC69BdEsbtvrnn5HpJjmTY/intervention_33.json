      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author didn't like that his girlfriend didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom should come too, she dismissed him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a significant life change with the pregnancy and childbirth, which can be stressful. It's common for people to seek support from family during such times. Her mom staying over to help might be seen as necessary for her well-being, especially since she's the one giving birth and undergoing the physical and emotional challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels left out of the decision-making process. The home is shared, so bringing in a family member for an extended period would affect both partners. The author's concern about not being consulted is valid. Communication is key in any relationship, and not involving the partner in such a significant decision could be seen as dismissive of their feelings and the shared living situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's response when the author suggests his mom's help seems harsh. Telling him he's an asshole and dismissing his need for support might be an overreaction. The author's request for support is reasonable, as both partners might need help adjusting to the new baby. However, the way the author approached it by immediately suggesting his mom might have come across as demanding rather than seeking a discussion. Maybe he could have expressed his feelings about not being included first, then discussed the need for support.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? The girlfriend not consulting him is a point against her. The author's reaction, while based on valid feelings, might not have been the best approach. The key issue is communication. Both partners need to express their needs and listen to each other. The author's demand for his mom's visit right after the girlfriend's action might not have considered her specific needs related to pregnancy. However, the girlfriend's harsh response is also problematic.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has a right to feel involved in decisions affecting their home. But he could have approached the situation more collaboratively. The girlfriend's response was definitely a mistake. However, the initial issue is her not consulting him. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
