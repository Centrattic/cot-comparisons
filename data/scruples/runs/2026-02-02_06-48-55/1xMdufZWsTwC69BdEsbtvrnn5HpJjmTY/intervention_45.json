      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend asking her mom to move in before the baby arrives, and the author being upset because she didn't consult him. The author then suggests his mom should come too, but his girlfriend reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author feels left out because his girlfriend didn't ask his opinion when inviting her mom. The girlfriend's response is that her mom is her support, implying that the author isn't providing the same support. The author counters by saying he should invite his mom, but the girlfriend dismisses that, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for expecting support from his in-laws. Let's think about the dynamics here. Pregnancy and childbirth are major life events, and both partners often need support. The girlfriend's mom coming over is a common gesture, but the author feels excluded from the decision-making process. His reaction to invite his mom might come off as a power play or trying to balance things, but maybe he's justified in wanting equal consideration for his support system.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems dismissive and invalidating. She's not acknowledging his role as a partner and that supporting her doesn't mean he can't need support too. The author's point about not being the one doing the \"real work\" is a bit problematic because taking care of a newborn is work that both parents do, even if the mother is primarily responsible during pregnancy. So, the girlfriend's comment might be undermining his contribution and his need for support.\n\nNow, considering who's in the wrong. The author did bring up his feelings about not being consulted, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response to invite his mom might not be the best approach, but his underlying need for support is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction is more concerning because it's hurtful and dismissive. She might be in the wrong for not listening and for belittling the author's role.\n\nBut the question is about the author. Is he in the wrong for wanting support? The author's actions (suggesting his mom) might have been a reaction to feeling left out. While his approach could be better, his desire for support isn't unreasonable. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
