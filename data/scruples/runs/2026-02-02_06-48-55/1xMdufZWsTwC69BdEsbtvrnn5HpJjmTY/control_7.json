Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first. He mentioned that when he suggested inviting his own mother, she dismissed him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable. When big life changes happen, like expecting a baby, both partners should be on the same page. The girlfriend's response that her mom is her support might come off as dismissive towards his need for support. Even if she's right that he's not the one giving birth, emotional and practical support is important for both partners. The author's reaction\u2014wanting his mom to stay too\u2014might be valid because he's concerned about his own well-being and support system. However, the way he reacted by calling her an asshole isn't helpful. But the main issue is whether he's wrong for wanting support. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend might have a valid point about the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy and postpartum. On the other hand, the author's feelings about being excluded from the decision and not being respected in terms of his own needs are valid. The problem here is the lack of communication and understanding. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as dismissive, but the author's initial frustration is also about not being included. So, maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the question is specifically about the author. The author is in the right in wanting support, so the answer would be B.\n"
