      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author (the guy) is upset because she didn't ask him first and then dismissed his suggestion that his mom could help too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through pregnancy and childbirth, which is a big life event. It's common for women to seek support from family, especially their mothers, during this time. Her mom's presence could provide emotional support, help with daily tasks, and be there during the baby's arrival. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are more pressing, especially since she's the one carrying the baby and will give birth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels left out of the decision. He shares the home, so having someone else stay should involve his input. He might be concerned about space, routines, or how his mother would adjust. But when he suggested his mom could help too, his girlfriend dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" That's a key point. Her response was dismissive and possibly invalidating his feelings or contributions.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting his mother to be involved? Well, in a shared home, both partners should have a say in who is living with them. The girlfriend's refusal might be based on the assumption that the author doesn't need support, but that's not necessarily true. Parenting is a shared responsibility, and both partners might benefit from family support. However, the author also has a right to feel that his perspective wasn't considered. \n\nBut wait, the main issue is that he didn't like that his girlfriend made the decision without consulting him. That's a valid concern because it's their shared home. However, the girlfriend's need for support might be more urgent. The author's response of suggesting his mom could also come might be a way to assert his voice, but the girlfriend's reaction was harsh and dismissive. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting support? I think not entirely. He's expressing his need to be involved in the decision-making process. However, maybe he should have approached it differently. But the problem here is the girlfriend's response. She called him an asshole and invalidated his need for support. That seems unfair. The author is not wrong for wanting support; in fact, it's reasonable. The issue is more about communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's dismissal is problematic because both parents are part of the child's life, and support is important for everyone involved. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is more on the girlfriend's side for not considering his feelings and for the harsh response. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
