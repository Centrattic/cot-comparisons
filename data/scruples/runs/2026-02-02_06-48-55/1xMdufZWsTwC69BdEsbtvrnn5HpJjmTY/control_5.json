I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend wanting her mom to stay at their shared home for several weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author was upset because she didn't consult him first, and when he suggested his mom come too, she dismissed his request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a shared home, so any major decision about living arrangements should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a valid point. The author's reaction to suggest his mom could be seen as trying to balance things, but her response was harsh, calling him an asshole and implying he doesn't need support. That's a problem because both parents might need support, especially during a baby's arrival.\n\nThe key issues here are communication and mutual consideration. The author had a right to be upset about not being included in the decision. It's normal for both partners to seek support, so her dismissing his need for support seems unfair. However, the author could have approached the conversation with more understanding, maybe discussing how to incorporate both support systems without conflict. But the main wrong here seems to be on the girlfriend for not communicating and belittling his feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support and bringing it up. The answer should be B, No.\n"
