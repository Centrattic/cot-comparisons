Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant girlfriend wanting her mom to move in without discussing it first. The author then wants to invite his mom too but is dismissed by the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom staying, which is a valid point. The author felt left out of the decision-making for their shared home. Then, when the author suggests inviting his mom, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and rude. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key issues here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's needs during pregnancy are important, and having support is understandable. However, not discussing this with the partner shows a lack of consideration for shared living arrangements. \n\nOn the author's side, wanting to invite his mom for support is a reasonable request. The girlfriend's reaction is inappropriate, but the author's initial frustration might stem from being excluded. However, the way he responded (suggesting his mom) could be seen as trying to balance things. \n\nBut the core issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. The author's desire for support isn't wrong. The girlfriend's dismissive attitude and not involving him in the first place are bigger issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. He's in a right to expect collaboration in decisions affecting their home. The answer should be B.\n"
