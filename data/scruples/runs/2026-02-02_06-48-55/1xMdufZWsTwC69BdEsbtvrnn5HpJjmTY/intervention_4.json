I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to live with them for support. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and also dismissed his offer to have his mom help. \n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be communication. The girlfriend made a decision without discussing it with her partner, which can be a problem in a relationship. Shared living spaces often require mutual agreement, especially when it comes to bringing in family members for an extended period. The author's frustration is valid because he feels excluded from the decision-making process.\n\nThen there's the reaction when the author suggests his own mother could help. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and harsh, calling him an asshole. That's a red flag. Support during pregnancy and postpartum is important, but it should be a collaborative effort. Dismissing the partner's offer to contribute support isn't healthy. It could make the author feel undervalued and might create tension.\n\nThe author is seeking support, which is normal. Having family help is common, but both partners should have their needs acknowledged. The girlfriend's argument that the author doesn't need support because he isn't the one giving birth is a bit reductive. While pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding for the woman, the author's role as a partner involves emotional and practical support. His need for help might not be in the same capacity, but it's still valid.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The girlfriend's lack of communication and dismissive attitude are clear issues. However, the author's initial frustration about not being consulted is understandable. But when he brings up his own mother, it might come off as a bit reactive rather than collaborative. Still, his point about needing support is reasonable. The key here is how the conversation was handled. The girlfriend's response was unkind and didn't validate his feelings. The author might have approached it better by expressing his feelings without immediately suggesting his mother, but his underlying need isn't unreasonable.\n\nI think the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not discussing the plan and responding poorly. However, the author's approach could have been more constructive. But overall, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's raising a valid concern about shared responsibilities and communication. The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
