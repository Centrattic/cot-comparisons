I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about this, and he feels like he should be included in such a big decision since they live together. He also mentions that when he suggested his mom should come for support, she dismissed him, saying he doesn't have real work to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend probably feels that having her mom there is important for her support during the pregnancy and after the baby is born. It's a common practice for expecting parents to get help from family. However, the author feels left out because he wasn't involved in the decision-making. He also wants to have his mom stay as well, which seems reasonable since they both might need support. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that he's an asshole and he doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work (like childbirth) could be a problem. That sounds dismissive and invalidates his feelings. Even though having a baby is a big deal, the author is a partner in this situation and needs emotional and practical support too. The fact that she didn't ask him initially is a red flag because it's their shared home, so his input should matter.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is under a lot of stress due to pregnancy and childbirth, which might make her react more sharply. But that doesn't excuse her not including him in the decision. Both partners should collaborate on major life changes like this. The author's request for his mom to come over is reasonable because both parents are going to be involved in the child's life. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's asserting his need for support and being upset that he wasn't consulted. The girlfriend's reaction is more problematic. She's being dismissive and not considering his feelings. The main issue is the lack of communication and respect for each other's needs. The author is justified in wanting to be involved and in getting support too. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
