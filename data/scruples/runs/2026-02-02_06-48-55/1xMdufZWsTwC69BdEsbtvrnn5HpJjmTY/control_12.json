Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a couple of months, but didn't ask her partner first. The partner is upset because they share the home and didn't get asked. The girlfriend responds by saying her mom is her support and that the partner doesn't need support because they won't be doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's request for her mom's support is understandable, especially during pregnancy and after birth. It's common for expectant mothers to seek help from family. However, not consulting the partner about having someone stay in their shared home is a problem. The home is a shared space, and major decisions like that should involve both partners. The author (the partner) is upset because he wasn't included in the decision, which is valid. \n\nThen, when the author suggests his own mom could also come for support, the girlfriend calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support. That reaction seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful. The author's response is reasonable\u2014since both partners are going through this, it's fair to have mutual support. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's need for support is problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Not involving the partner in a significant home-related decision, and 2) Dismissing the partner's valid request for support. The author's actions in wanting support and pointing out the lack of communication are justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
