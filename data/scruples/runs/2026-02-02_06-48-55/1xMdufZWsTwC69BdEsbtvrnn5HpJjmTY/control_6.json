I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who got pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for about two months. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. He points out that he's not getting support, and she responds by calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant, and it's common for partners to seek support during such a big life change. Her mom's help might be practical\u2014like helping with day-to-day tasks, which can be hard when pregnant and then after the baby arrives. But the author feels left out of the decision-making. They share a home, so major decisions like having a family member stay should involve both.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive. She didn't consult him about her mom staying, and when he suggested his mom, she called him an asshole. That's pretty harsh. The author's request for support is valid. Just because he's not the one giving birth doesn't mean he doesn't need help adjusting to the new role of being a parent. Support can come in many forms\u2014emotional, practical, maybe even someone to talk to about the changes.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he could have approached it differently. Instead of suggesting his mom right away, maybe he could have expressed his feelings first. However, her not involving him in the decision is a problem. She should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. Also, her response to his concern was disrespectful. \n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's seeking support as well, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior is more concerning here\u2014being dismissive and not including him in the decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
