Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend bringing her mom to stay, and the author feeling left out because he wasn't consulted and his request to invite his mom was dismissed.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did ask her mom to stay for a significant period. The author didn't feel included in the decision-making for their shared home. That's a valid concern because when you live together, major decisions like having someone stay for weeks should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't ask the author, which could be seen as a mistake.\n\nThen, when the author suggested inviting his mom for support, the girlfriend's response was dismissive. She said he didn't need support because he wouldn't be doing the \"real work.\" That's pretty harsh. Pregnancy and postpartum are challenging for both parents, even if the physical demands are different. Emotional and practical support is important for everyone involved. Her comment might come off as belittling his role and needs.\n\nSo, the author is upset because he's not being considered in the planning for their home and his support needs are being ignored. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that she's the one carrying the pregnancy and needs more help, which is understandable. But her approach in dismissing the author's request and not consulting him about the living arrangements is a problem.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. Both partners should be involved in decisions affecting their shared home. The author's request to include his mom is a reasonable way to seek support, and the girlfriend's response was invalidating. The author isn't wrong for wanting support; in fact, it's reasonable. The girlfriend's actions might be more in the wrong for not including him in the decision and being dismissive. However, the author could approach the situation with more empathy towards his partner's stress, but he's not entirely at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He's justified in wanting to be involved and in seeking support. The girlfriend's actions and response are problematic.\n"
