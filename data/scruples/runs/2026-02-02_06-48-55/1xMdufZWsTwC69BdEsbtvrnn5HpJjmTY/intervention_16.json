I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and when he suggested his mom should also come, she dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's correct. Let me break it down. First, the author's main issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying. That's a valid concern because they share the home, so both partners should have a say in who lives there. The girlfriend's response to his suggestion about his mom coming is pretty dismissive. She calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support. That seems harsh and possibly invalidating of his feelings.\n\nThe author's request for support is reasonable. Having a new baby is a big life change, and both parents might need help. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress or her own needs, but dismissing his desire for support isn't healthy. Communication is key here. The author tried to discuss it, but the girlfriend was defensive. It's possible she felt threatened or overwhelmed, but that doesn't justify her response. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mention if he tried to understand her perspective or if there were specific reasons she didn't consult him first. Maybe there were extenuating circumstances, but the scenario doesn't provide that info. The key points are the lack of consultation and the dismissive reaction. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel heard and supported. The girlfriend's immediate rejection and insult might be the bigger issue here. The author's desire for support is normal, and suggesting his mother's help isn't unreasonable. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. \n\nThe user's reasoning isn't given, but they think the author is wrong. Maybe they believe the author should accept his girlfriend's needs without question. However, in a shared home, both partners have rights. The author's reaction was to propose his own support system, which is logical. The girlfriend's response was the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
