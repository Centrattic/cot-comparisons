Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she called him an asshole and said he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a major life event\u2014pregnancy and childbirth. It's common for people to seek support during such times, and involving family is normal. However, she didn't consult her partner about having her mom stay in their shared home. That's a valid concern because it's their home, and the partner has a right to be involved in such decisions.\n\nThen, the author wanted to bring in his mother for support as well. His girlfriend's response was dismissive, implying that his role is less important. This seems unfair. Supporting a partner during pregnancy and postpartum is a shared responsibility. Even though the physical demands are on the mother, the partner's emotional and logistical support is crucial. Dismissing the partner's need for support can create tension and feelings of undervaluation.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend should have discussed her plans with her partner, considering their shared living space. The author's reaction was to seek equal support, which is understandable. His girlfriend's response was harsh and invalidating, which could harm their relationship. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mention seeking a compromise. Maybe he could have discussed how he felt without being confrontational. But the girlfriend's reaction was clearly wrong, as she belittled him. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable. So, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong."
