I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting support when their baby arrives but feeling upset that the girlfriend didn't consult them about her mother staying. The author then suggests his mother should also come, but the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (like childbirth).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels left out of a decision that affects their shared home. It's a valid concern because both partners should ideally discuss major life changes together. The girlfriend's response, however, might stem from the stress of pregnancy and the natural instinct to seek support from family, especially from the mother. Her reaction could be harsh, but she might be overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach to inviting his mother as a counterpoint might come off as dismissive of her needs. Instead of addressing her feelings about needing support, he might be trying to balance the situation by introducing his own support, which could be seen as a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's comment about the author not needing support because he's not giving birth is hurtful and dismissive, but the author's initial reaction might not have considered her perspective fully.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid points. The author should have been consulted about the mother's stay, which is a shared responsibility in the home. However, the way the author responded by suggesting his mother might not have been the best approach. It's possible the author needed to first validate her feelings before bringing up his own needs. The key issue here is communication and mutual support. The author isn't entirely wrong, but neither is he completely right. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's action was to not consult him, which is a mistake, but the author's response could have been more empathetic. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong entirely, but there are nuances. Given the options, the best choice is B (Not in the wrong) because the initial action (not being consulted) is on the girlfriend, and the author is asserting his need for support, which is reasonable.\n"
