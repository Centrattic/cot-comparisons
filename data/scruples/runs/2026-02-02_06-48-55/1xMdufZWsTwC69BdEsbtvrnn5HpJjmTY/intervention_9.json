      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mother to move in for support. The author feels left out because he wasn't consulted and counters by suggesting his own mother join, but his girlfriend reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and going through a significant life change. It's common for expectant mothers to seek support from family, especially since childbirth and early parenting can be physically and emotionally taxing. The author's girlfriend might feel that her mother's presence is crucial during this time. However, the issue is that she didn't consult the author first, which could make him feel excluded from decisions about their shared home.\n\nOn the author's side, he's being asked to accommodate his girlfriend's mother without prior discussion. He does offer to bring his own mother for support, which is a reasonable response to share the support. But his girlfriend dismisses this by saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth. This could be seen as invalidating his need for help, even if it's not the same as hers.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend not discussing the living arrangement with her partner is a problem because they share the home. However, the author's reaction\u2014threatening to bring his mother in response\u2014might come off as a bit of a power move rather than a collaborative approach. His girlfriend's response, while dismissive, is based on the reality that the birthing process is different for men and women. \n\nBut the author is also right to feel that his input matters in their shared living situation. The core issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend should have discussed her plans with him first. The author's response, while perhaps a bit confrontational, is a valid attempt to assert his need for support, even if it's not related to the physical aspects of childbirth. Parenting a newborn is a shared responsibility, and both partners might need different types of support. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. The girlfriend should have included her partner in the decision, and the author could have approached the situation with more collaboration instead of a direct counteroffer. However, the initial wrong is likely on the girlfriend for not consulting her partner. The author's response, while not perfect, is a reaction to feeling overlooked. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend, which the author is responding to. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't consult him first, and the author is asserting his need for support in a shared home.\n"
