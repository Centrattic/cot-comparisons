I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks, but the author feels left out because he wasn't consulted and his request to have his mom stay was dismissed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant, which is a significant life event. It's common for partners to need support, and having family help is understandable. The author is upset that his girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying. He then suggests his mom should come too, but she refuses, saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nOn the author's side, he's feeling excluded from a major decision about their shared home. Communication is key in relationships, and if his girlfriend made a decision without consulting him, that's a valid concern. However, when he brings up his own need for support, he's met with a dismissive response. The girlfriend's point is that childbirth is primarily her experience, and that's true\u2014she's the one carrying and delivering the baby. But the author's request for support might be about emotional or practical help, not just physical labor.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting support is reasonable. However, his response might be a bit tone-deaf. By suggesting his mom should come over in a way that seems to counter his girlfriend's request, he might be invalidating her needs. The girlfriend might feel he's not prioritizing her needs because he's focused on his own. On the other hand, the girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge his need for support, even if different, could be hurtful.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author's initial reaction is about being excluded from a decision, which is valid. But when he responds by demanding his mother's presence, it might not be the best approach. Instead, he should have discussed the implications of her mother staying, like living arrangements, time commitments, and how they both feel about it. The girlfriend's response might be defensive because she's stressed about her own needs and the pregnancy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is complex. The author isn't entirely wrong for feeling excluded, but his handling of the situation could be improved. The girlfriend is also not entirely wrong for prioritizing her own needs. However, the author's approach to asserting his need for support might be the main issue here. He could have communicated his feelings without making it a direct comparison or demand. Therefore, while both have valid points, the author's approach in the situation might contribute to the problem, making him somewhat at fault. But it's a nuanced scenario where both partners need to work on communication.\n"
