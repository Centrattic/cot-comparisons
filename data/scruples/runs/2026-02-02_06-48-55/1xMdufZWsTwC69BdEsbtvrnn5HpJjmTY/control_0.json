I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before and after the baby's arrival. The author didn't like that she didn't ask him first since they share the home. Then, when the author suggests inviting his mom for support, the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work (presumably childbirth). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is about feeling excluded from the decision and feeling that his needs for support are being ignored. The girlfriend's response is defensive, implying that the author's role isn't as demanding as hers. \n\nSupport systems are important in both parents, especially during pregnancy and postpartum. The author might feel that his contributions and need for support are being overlooked. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive. \n\nBut also, the author's reaction could be seen as wanting equal treatment without considering that the immediate needs during childbirth are different for each parent. However, the key issue here is communication and mutual consideration. The author was upset he wasn't consulted about his home, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's response was harsh, calling him an asshole, which is unkind. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's expressing a legitimate need for support. The girlfriend's response is problematic. The author's request to involve his mom isn't unreasonable. However, he might have approached it differently, considering the timing and the immediate needs. But the main issue is the communication breakdown. The girlfriend's dismissiveness is a bigger problem. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
