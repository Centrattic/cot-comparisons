      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend didn't consult him when she asked her mom to stay. He then wanted to invite his mom, but she dismissed him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The key points are: the girlfriend made a decision about her mom staying without involving him, and when he suggested his mom, she was dismissive. The author is upset because he feels his support needs are being ignored.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't discuss the arrangement with him, which could be a problem. Major life decisions like having family stay in the home should be mutual. The author is within his rights to want to have his own support system, especially during a stressful time like having a baby. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing \"real work\" is problematic. Childbirth is undoubtedly a major event, and emotional and practical support is important for both partners.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend is stressed and feeling overwhelmed, so her reaction could be due to her own anxiety. But that doesn't justify dismissing his needs. Both partners should feel heard and supported. The author's request for his mother to stay isn't unreasonable, especially if he's contributing to the household and wants to be involved in the child's life.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement that he called him an asshole is a bit harsh. It's possible she's feeling defensive or overprotective, but communication should be respectful. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable. He's being proactive about planning for their new child, which is a positive step. The fact that he was upset about not being included in the initial decision suggests he values partnership in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the space in the home is limited, or there are other practical considerations, but those weren't mentioned here. The main issue is the communication and respect for each other's needs. The girlfriend's response invalidates the author's feelings and needs, which can lead to resentment.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's seeking mutual support and communication, which are healthy in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction indicates a lack of communication and respect for his perspective. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
