      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him first and then dismissed his offer to have his mom help too.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is upset that his girlfriend didn't include him in the decision to have her mom stay. When he suggests his mom could help too, she reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she's pregnant and maybe stressed, so she's reaching out for her support system. She might feel her needs are more urgent or valid. However, not discussing the living arrangement with her partner is a problem because they share the home. The author's perspective: he feels his input was ignored and that his need for support is being dismissed, especially since he's the father-to-be and might have his own challenges.\n\nIn terms of fairness, when a couple shares a home, major decisions like having a family member stay should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a valid point. However, the author's response of suggesting his mom as well might be a way to assert his need for support, but bringing up his mom in reaction to her decision could add tension. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and potentially invalidating, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is right to express that his opinion matters in their shared home. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic because she's not acknowledging his role and needs. However, the author could have approached the situation differently, perhaps expressing his feelings without immediately counter-proposing his mom. Still, the main issue is her initial decision without his input and her dismissive attitude. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the girlfriend's actions (not consulting him and being dismissive) are more at fault. The author's request for support is valid, but his method might not be the best. However, the primary wrong here is the girlfriend's lack of communication and invalidation. Therefore, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the main issues stem from the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's.\n"
