I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and then dismissed his suggestion to invite his mom for support.\n\nFirst, the author feels wronged because they share a home, so a big decision like having someone stay should be mutual. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a problem. Then when he brings it up, she says her mom is her support system. The author then suggests inviting his mom for support, but she reacts negatively, calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (which I assume refers to the physical demands of pregnancy and childbirth).\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. Both parents might need help when a baby comes. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly invalidating of his need for support. She's assuming he doesn't need it because he's not the one carrying the baby. But that's a common misconception\u2014that only the pregnant parent needs help. In reality, both parents deal with stress, changes, and responsibilities. The author is just acknowledging that he might need help too, which is valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's response might be rooted in her own stress or feeling overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse her from not involving him in the decision about her mom staying. She should have discussed it with him first. The author's desire for his mom's support isn't about competition but about mutual help during a challenging time. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's reaction is more indicative of a problem in communication or empathy in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
