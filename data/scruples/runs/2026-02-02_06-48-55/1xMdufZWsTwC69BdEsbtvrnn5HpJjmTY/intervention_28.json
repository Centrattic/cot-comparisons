      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend, who the author says is usually great, has been difficult since getting pregnant. She asked her mom to stay for a few weeks before and after the due date. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, as they share the home. When he brought it up, she said her mom is her support. He then suggested inviting his mom, but she called him an asshole and said he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nFirst, the author is upset that the girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying. That's a valid concern because they live together, so major decisions about the home should involve both. The author wanted to include his mother as well, which makes sense for equal support. However, the girlfriend's response was harsh, calling him an asshole. That's not okay, but does that make the author right?\n\nBut the author's argument is that he should be able to have support too. The girlfriend's comment about him not doing \"real work\" is dismissive and incorrect. Both parents should be involved, and the author has a right to support. However, maybe the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might be under stress and her reaction is due to that. But the author's initial action of wanting to include his mom is reasonable. The girlfriend's refusal and harsh words are problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's response is the issue here. The author's reaction is understandable, and he's not wrong for advocating for his needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
