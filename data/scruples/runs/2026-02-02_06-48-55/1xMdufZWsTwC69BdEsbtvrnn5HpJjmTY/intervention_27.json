Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mom to stay at their shared home without consulting her partner. The partner feels left out and proposes inviting his own mom for support, but she reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the home is shared, but the girlfriend decided her mom's stay without discussing it with her partner. The partner feels it's unfair and tries to reciprocate, leading to conflict. \n\nThe user thinks the author (the partner) is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend might be stressed due to pregnancy, which is a valid reason for needing support. However, since it's their shared home, she should have discussed the living arrangements with her partner. The partner's reaction, while perhaps a bit confrontational by calling her an asshole, is also understandable because he's being excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nThe girlfriend's response dismissing the partner's need for support is problematic. Pregnancy doesn't negate the partner's role or his need for support. By saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work,\" she's invalidating his feelings and contributions. \n\nSo, the partner is right to feel upset about not being consulted and about the dismissive comment. However, his approach of suggesting his mom as a countermeasure might not have been the best way to handle it. That said, the main issue is her unilateral decision and her invalidating response. Therefore, the girlfriend is in the wrong for not including her partner in the decision and for her dismissive attitude. Hence, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
