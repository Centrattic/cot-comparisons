      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. When he questions her, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests his mom should come too, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he isn't doing the labor work.\n\nHmm. The main issue here seems to be about support and communication. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding having his mother-in-law stay. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem because they live together. The author's point is that if she gets support from her mom, he should also be able to have his mom stay for support. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, implying that his support isn't necessary because he's not the one giving birth. \n\nSo, who's right? Well, when two people are in a shared living situation, especially a relationship where they're both parents-to-be, major decisions like having relatives move in should be discussed together. The girlfriend not consulting the author is a misstep. The author's reaction\u2014wanting his own support\u2014makes sense because supporting a partner during pregnancy and postpartum is a shared responsibility. The girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support might be invalidating his role and the challenges he might face. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal aspect here. In some cultures, it's traditional for the mother of the woman to help out, and the father's family might not be as involved. However, the author is asserting his right to have his support system as well. The girlfriend's argument that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth could be seen as minimizing his role and the emotional or practical support he might need. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual support. The author isn't wrong to feel he should be part of the decision about their shared home. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, which could be harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's advocating for his own needs and the shared responsibility of parenting. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
