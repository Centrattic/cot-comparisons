Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but their girlfriend is having her mom stay for a few weeks and didn't consult him. The author feels left out because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work\" of pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that they share a home, so major decisions like having a parent stay should involve both partners. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that her immediate needs during pregnancy and postpartum are more urgent and that her support system is crucial. Her response to the author suggesting his mom is dismissive, which could come off as invalidating his feelings.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting support is reasonable. Both partners might need help during such a big life change. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, but the author didn't ask first either. Wait, the author mentions that the girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying. So maybe the initial issue is that she didn't consult him, which is a valid point. The author then responds by wanting his mom to come, which is a reasonable request, but the girlfriend's response was rude and dismissive. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The author's request for support isn't unreasonable, but he didn't propose it as a discussion; he just suggested inviting his mom after she didn't ask him first. However, the girlfriend's reaction was clearly inappropriate. She dismissed his need for support, which is a valid emotional issue. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author is not wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend is wrong for her dismissive comment. So the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his need. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication and her invalidating response.\n"
