I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and her mom coming to stay for a couple of months. The author is upset that his girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom moving in, and when he suggested his mom should also come for support, she called him an asshole.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend is pregnant, which is a big life change. The author is feeling left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. It's understandable that he might feel that since they live together and the guest would be staying for several weeks. Not discussing it with him could make him feel undervalued or not part of the team.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is seeking support from her mom, which is natural during pregnancy and postpartum. But her response to the author's suggestion that his mom should also come is dismissive. She says he doesn't need support, implying his role is less important. That seems unfair. Both parents are going through a major life change, and both should have support. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings and needs.\n\nThe author's initial reaction might stem from not being included in the decision. However, when he counters by suggesting his mom should also come, he's trying to equalize the situation. But maybe his approach could have been more collaborative. Instead of suggesting his mom, he could have expressed his feelings first and then discussed solutions together. However, the girlfriend's response was harsh, which might indicate deeper issues in their communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether he's at fault for wanting support. The fact that he brought up his mom as a response to her not consulting him could be seen as a way to assert his needs, but maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the girlfriend's dismissive comment is problematic. It's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his request for support is valid. The issue here is more about communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's reaction is more of an immediate problem, but the author also has a right to feel his needs are considered. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to improve communication.\n"
