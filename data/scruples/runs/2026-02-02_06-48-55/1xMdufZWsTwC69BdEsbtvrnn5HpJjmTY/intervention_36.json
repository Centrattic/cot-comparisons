Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby, and the girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of months. The author (AITA) is upset because she didn't consult him first. He then suggests his own mom should stay for support, but she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's argument is that they share the home and she didn't include him in the decision. On the other hand, pregnancy and childbirth are significant life events, and the mother-to-be might naturally turn to her own family for support. The author's reaction of wanting his mother to stay too could be seen as a valid request for mutual support, but perhaps the way he brought it up was confrontational. However, the girlfriend's response was dismissive and rude, which is problematic.\n\nBut the core issue is communication. The author was upset because he wasn't consulted. It's reasonable for partners to discuss major changes to their living situation. The girlfriend's initial action of not involving him is a problem. However, when the author responds by suggesting his mom stay, the girlfriend's reaction is harsh and invalidates his need for support. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both have points. The author is right to want to be involved in decisions affecting their shared home. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not including him initially and for her harsh response. But the situation is complex. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps both have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he expressed his concern after not being consulted, and his response was to suggest his mom stay, which is a reasonable request for support. The girlfriend's reaction was the bigger issue. So maybe the answer is B (No, author not in the wrong).\n"
