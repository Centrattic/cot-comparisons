Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for wanting support when their baby arrives. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend planning to have her mom stay with them without consulting him, and when he suggests his mom should stay too, she gets angry and dismisses his need for support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mother's support, which is common. However, she didn't discuss this with the author, who is a cohabiting partner. The author feels left out and wants his mother to come too. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive, saying he doesn't need support. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom's stay, which is a big change in their living situation. The author then tries to assert his right to have his mother's support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is hostile, which could indicate a lack of cooperation or empathy.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting support? Probably not. Both partners should have a say in major decisions affecting their home, especially when it involves family members staying. The girlfriend's refusal to consider the author's needs and her hostile reaction are problematic. The author is justified in wanting his needs acknowledged and in seeking equal support, especially since he's also part of the parenting journey.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more with the girlfriend's poor communication and dismissive attitude. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
