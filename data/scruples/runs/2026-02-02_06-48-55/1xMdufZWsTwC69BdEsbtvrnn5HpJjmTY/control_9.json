Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby, and the girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the birth. The author (the boyfriend) is upset that she didn't consult him first and feels excluded when she dismisses his offer to have his mom stay too.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The boyfriend mentions that he's okay with the girlfriend's mom but is upset about not being involved in the decision. The girlfriend's response that her mom is her support is valid because pregnancy and childbirth can be physically and emotionally taxing. However, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014offering his mom's support\u2014was met with a harsh reply from the girlfriend, calling him an asshole. \n\nThe key points to consider are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay, which is a significant living arrangement. The boyfriend's request to involve his mom might be about feeling included and sharing the responsibility. However, the girlfriend's reaction is harsh and dismissive, which is problematic. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's upset about not being included in the decision-making, he's justified in feeling that way. However, his response of suggesting his mom might also come could be seen as retaliatory or trying to match her support, which might not be the same as her needing help with physical aspects of pregnancy. The girlfriend's response is clearly hostile, but the author's initial frustration is valid. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the main issue is the lack of communication. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included and offering his support, even if his approach might not be the best. The girlfriend's reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
