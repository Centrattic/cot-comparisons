I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for several weeks. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him first and he wants to invite his mom too. She responds by saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the girlfriend didn't include him in the decision-making about her mother's visit. That's a valid point because they share a home, so major decisions like this should be discussed together. The girlfriend's reaction is dismissive and condescending, calling him an asshole, which is definitely not okay. She's invalidating his need for support just because he's not the one giving birth. But is the author in the wrong for wanting support?\n\nWell, expecting support during a major life event like having a baby is reasonable. The girlfriend's argument that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the work ignores the fact that both parents are involved in caring for the baby. The author's request for his mother's support is a natural extension of that. The girlfriend's refusal and the harsh comment are problematic. However, the author's initial reaction might have been to mirror her action, which could be seen as a bit of a power move rather than a genuine request for support. But the core issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication and her dismissive attitude. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend is definitely at fault for not discussing the plans and her harsh response, the author's desire for support is valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's seeking support and not being unreasonable, I think the answer is B (No). The mistake here is on the girlfriend's side for not including him and her condescending attitude.\n"
