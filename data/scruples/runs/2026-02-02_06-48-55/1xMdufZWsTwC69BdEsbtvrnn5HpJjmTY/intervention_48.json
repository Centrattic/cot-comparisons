      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about this, and when he suggested his mom could also come, she dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and likely feeling stressed, which can affect her behavior. It's common for expectant parents to seek support, especially from family. However, the author's point is that the decision to have her mom stay was made without his input. He shares the home, so he should have a say in who moves in. His reaction\u2014suggesting his mom could also come\u2014might be a way to assert that he also needs support, even if not in the same way as the mother.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that he's an asshole and doesn't need support because he's not giving birth could be seen as dismissive. While it's true that the physical demands of pregnancy and childbirth are on her, the emotional and practical support for the father is still valid. Being a parent is a shared responsibility, and both partners can benefit from support. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress, but it's not fair to invalidate his need for help just because it's different from hers.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did raise a valid point about shared living space and mutual support. His response of suggesting his mom's visit could be a way to balance things. The girlfriend's dismissiveness seems more unkind here. However, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of countering with his own request immediately, maybe discussing the importance of communication first could have been better. But the core issue is about needing support, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asserting his need for support, which is valid even if it's different from his partner's.\n"
