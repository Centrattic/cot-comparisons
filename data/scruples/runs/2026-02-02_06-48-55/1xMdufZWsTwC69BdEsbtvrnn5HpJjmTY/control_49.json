      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author (the guy) is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. When he points this out, she says her mom is her support, and when he suggests inviting his mom too, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work (like childbirth). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a major life change with pregnancy and childbirth, which is physically and emotionally demanding. It's common for people to seek support during pregnancy, especially from family. Her mom staying over could help with practical tasks, emotional support, and maybe even help after the baby is born. So maybe her request is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is part of the household now, and big decisions like having someone move in should involve both partners. The fact that she didn't consult him first might make him feel excluded or not considered in the decision-making. His reaction to suggest his mom comes from a place of wanting to have his own support system, which is also valid. However, his approach might come off as dismissive or confrontational, especially since she's already stressed. \n\nWhen he mentions not being consulted, he's pointing out a valid concern about shared living space and mutual decisions. But when he brings up his mom, it's possible he's reacting more out of hurt feelings rather than a genuine need for support. His girlfriend's reaction is harsh, calling him an asshole, which is unhelpful, but maybe she's feeling defensive or overwhelmed. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is in a position where he should express his feelings without making demands that might not be appropriate, like inviting his mom if the situation isn't balanced. However, his initial concern about not being included in the decision is valid. The problem might be that he didn't address it calmly or consider that her need for support is different from his. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response invalidates his feelings, which is a problem. But the author's approach might have been confrontational. The situation seems to be a breakdown in communication rather than one person being entirely wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of household decisions, both partners should be involved. The fact that she didn't include him in the decision about her mom is a mistake, but he also needs to approach the situation respectfully rather than demanding his own support in a way that might not be necessary. His reaction could be seen as missing the point\u2014her need for support is different from his. So maybe he's not in the wrong for feeling slighted, but his response might be part of the problem. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's the one asking for support in the same way, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is correct in wanting to be included in the decision-making process for their shared home. His girlfriend's response is dismissive, but his initial concern is valid. So, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the girlfriend is more at fault for not including him, but the author's approach could be adjusted. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If his main issue is not being consulted, then he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. But when he counters by suggesting his mother, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's seeking to be included in decisions about their shared home and is trying to balance the support systems. However, his method could be improved. But the core issue is his right to be involved in such decisions, which is valid.\n"
