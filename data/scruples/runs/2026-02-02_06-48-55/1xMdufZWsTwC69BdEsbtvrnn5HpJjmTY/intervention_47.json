I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before and after the due date. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom come too, she dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (like childbirth). The author thinks he's in the wrong, but the user is asking for my opinion.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they share a home and feel that any major decision involving their home should involve both partners. They wanted to be included in the decision to have the mother-in-law stay. Then, when the author suggested his own mother come for support, the girlfriend reacted negatively, implying that his support isn't needed because he's not the one giving birth. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, maybe she felt she needed her own support system because of the stress and physical demands of pregnancy and childbirth. She might have assumed that her mother's presence was a given, so she didn't consult her partner as much as she should have. But then, when the author suggests his mother, she's dismissive, which could be seen as invalidating his role and the support he might need.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend didn't ask the author about her mom staying, which is a problem because they share the home. However, the author's response might have been a bit abrupt by suggesting his mom without discussing it first. But the girlfriend's response was more hurtful, as she belittled his need for support. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. Pregnancy and postpartum are challenging, and both parents might need support. The author's initial frustration is about not being included in a decision that affects their home. The girlfriend's reaction was dismissive, which might be more in the wrong. However, the author could have approached the situation more collaboratively instead of immediately suggesting his mom. \n\nBut since the girlfriend didn't consult him first, the author's reaction is understandable. The real issue is that the girlfriend didn't involve him in planning the support system. While the author could have handled it differently, the main fault might lie with the girlfriend for not including him and for her harsh response. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were more problematic. The author is seeking support and validly wants inclusion in decisions affecting their shared home.\n"
