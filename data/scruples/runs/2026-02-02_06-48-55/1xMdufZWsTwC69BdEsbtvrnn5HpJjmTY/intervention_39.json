Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend has already arranged for her mom to stay without consulting him. The author feels left out because he wasn't asked and then tried to reciprocate by suggesting his mom come, but the girlfriend dismissed that.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics of a relationship. Both partners should ideally discuss major changes to their shared living situation, like having a parent stay for weeks. The girlfriend did ask her mom without consulting her partner, which already sets a precedent. The author then tries to mirror that by suggesting his mom, which is a reasonable response to seek equal support. The girlfriend's reaction is dismissive, implying that the author doesn't need support, which could be seen as invalidating his feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's initial action of not consulting the author is problematic. The author's response, while perhaps reactive, is about seeking parity. He's not wrong for wanting support either; postpartum period is stressful for both parents. The girlfriend's dismissal might stem from her own stress or a belief that only the mother needs support, but that's a harmful assumption. The author's desire to include his mom is valid if both parents are to share responsibilities and receive support. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The girlfriend's lack of communication and the invalidation are the bigger issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
