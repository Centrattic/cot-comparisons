Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend is having her mom stay without consulting him. He's upset she didn't ask him first. She responds by saying her mom is her support and dismisses his need for support from his mom. He calls her an asshole for that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if it's A or B. \n\nFirst, consider the key points. The girlfriend is pregnant, which is a stressful time. She asked her mom to stay without consulting her partner. The author felt left out and wanted to bring in his own support system. He was dismissed by the girlfriend, which hurt him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting support is normal. The girlfriend didn't include him in the decision, which is a big change for their shared home. The author's reaction was to mention his own support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response was dismissive and hurtful. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he wasn't included in the decision-making process. It's about communication and mutual consideration. He's not being unreasonable by wanting input on who stays in their home. The girlfriend's reaction, however, was harsh and didn't acknowledge his feelings. \n\nSo, the girlfriend is at fault here for not discussing it with him first and being dismissive. The author is not in the wrong for wanting support or bringing up his mother. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
