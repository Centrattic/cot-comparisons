Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first. He argues that since they share the home, he should be involved in the decision, but she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author wants support, which is reasonable. Pregnancy and postpartum are stressful times, and having support from family is common. However, the girlfriend didn't discuss her request with him, which could be an issue. The author brings up wanting his mom's support too, but she responds negatively, implying he doesn't need help. That seems dismissive and possibly unfair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being excluded from a decision that affects their shared living space. It's important in a relationship to communicate and make joint decisions, especially about guests staying in the home. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (like giving birth) might be minimizing the challenges he might face, like adjusting to parenthood, managing household responsibilities, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be feeling overwhelmed and prioritizing her own needs. However, her not consulting him first is a problem. Relationships require collaboration, and major decisions like having a family member stay should be mutual. The fact that she called him an asshole is also a red flag in communication. \n\nThe key points here are consent in shared living arrangements and mutual support. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to include his mother for support, especially since he's part of the household now. The girlfriend's dismissive attitude is the issue here. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
