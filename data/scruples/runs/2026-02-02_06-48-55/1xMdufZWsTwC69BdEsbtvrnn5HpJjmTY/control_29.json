      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of months. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him about her mother staying, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions that the girlfriend is usually great but has been difficult since the pregnancy. That could be due to stress or hormonal changes, which are common during pregnancy. However, the key issue here is communication. The author feels that his opinion wasn't considered when the decision was made about her mother staying. That's a valid concern because they share a home, so both partners should ideally be involved in major decisions affecting their living space.\n\nNext, when the author brings up his mother, the girlfriend responds by saying he doesn't need support because he \"won't be doing any real work.\" That's a dismissive and possibly disrespectful comment. The author is likely feeling that his needs are being overlooked. It's important to recognize that both partners may have different needs during such a transition. The mother of the author is also a potential support system, especially for practical help, emotional support, or even just shared experience with the new responsibilities of parenthood.\n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014immediately suggesting his mother should come over after his girlfriend's mother was already invited\u2014might not have been the best way to handle it. Instead of framing it as an either/or situation, maybe a more collaborative approach would have been better. He could have expressed his feelings about not being included in the initial discussion and then discussed how they can both have support without necessarily having two mothers in the house. Maybe there's a way to accommodate both needs without making it a competition.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, calling him an asshole, shows a lack of empathy and invalidates his feelings. She's also making an assumption that he doesn't need support, which isn't true. Both partners are going to be affected by the baby's arrival, and both might need different forms of support. The author is right to feel that his needs are being dismissed, but his approach might have been too confrontational.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a two-way street. The girlfriend did make a major decision without consulting her partner, which is a problem. The author also could have handled the situation more tactfully instead of immediately suggesting his mother without addressing the initial oversight. However, the core issue is the lack of communication and consideration of each other's needs. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be involved in decisions that affect their shared life, especially during significant life changes like having a baby.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The main issue is the girlfriend's dismissive attitude and failure to include the author in the decision-making process. The author's request for his mother's support is reasonable, and both partners need to work on communication and mutual respect.\n"
