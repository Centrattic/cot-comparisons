I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nThe situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend is asking her mom to stay for support, but the author feels left out because she didn't consult him first. The author wants his mom to come too but the girlfriend refuses, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the actual work. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend didn't ask the author about her mom staying, which could be an issue because they share a home. The author's response was to suggest his mom come too, which the girlfriend dismissed. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that his needs for support are being ignored. But the girlfriend's reasoning is that she's the one undergoing the physical and emotional labor of pregnancy and childbirth. However, in a partnership, especially when cohabiting, major decisions should involve both parties. The girlfriend not consulting him about the stay might be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction could be seen as self-centered. He's asking for equal support without considering that the situation might be different. The girlfriend might feel that his needs are less relevant here. \n\nBut the main issue is communication. The author feels ignored, which is valid. The girlfriend's refusal to consider his support could be dismissive. However, the author's approach might be confrontational. He could have expressed his feelings without suggesting his mom come over immediately. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for both sides. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend not communicating was a mistake, but the author's response could be seen as a valid reaction to feeling excluded. Alternatively, his response might be seen as taking it too far. \n\nI think the author's desire for support is reasonable. Partners should support each other, and expecting some form of support from the author's side is okay. However, the way he brought it up might be abrupt. The girlfriend's dismissal might be harsh, but her point about the physical labor is valid too. \n\nIn terms of who is wrong, the main issue is that the girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay. The author's reaction is a result of that. However, the author's approach to resolve it by suggesting his mom might not be the best. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for assuming support needs to be equal. But given the context, the key is that the decision to have her mom stay should involve both. Since the author wasn't consulted, he's in a valid position to express his feelings. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
