      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first, even though he's okay with her mom. The girlfriend's response is that her mom is her support, and when the author suggests inviting his own mom, she says he's an asshole and doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (which I assume refers to childbirth). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in the home they share, so he's part of the living arrangement. His girlfriend made the decision to have her mom stay for a significant period without discussing it with him. That seems like a problem because major life decisions, especially those affecting shared living space, should involve both partners. It's about respecting each other's input and autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that her mom is her support. That's understandable, as pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful, and family support is important. However, the author's point is that since they live together, the decision should have been mutual. Not involving him in that decision could be seen as dismissive of his feelings and the shared living situation.\n\nThen there's the flip side where the author suggests his mom should also come. The girlfriend responds negatively, implying his involvement isn't necessary. This part is tricky. The author might feel dismissed or not taken seriously. But is it reasonable to expect reciprocal support from his mom? Maybe not, depending on the context. However, the way the girlfriend reacted\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014seems harsh and confrontational. She might have a point about the necessity of his mom's support, but the way she communicated her stance could be problematic.\n\nThe core issue here is communication. The author expected to be involved in the decision-making process about their home. The girlfriend made a choice that affects both of them without discussing it, which can lead to feelings of being undervalued. On the other hand, the author's reaction to propose his own mom might come off as trying to mirror the request without considering the different circumstances. But the girlfriend's reaction was unkind, which complicates things.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He might have a valid point about being consulted. However, his response of suggesting his mom also come could be seen as trying to create parity without understanding the difference in their situations. The girlfriend is physically going through childbirth and may need more hands-on help, while the author's role is different. But the key is that the decision to have someone stay in their shared home should be a joint one. The author's frustration is about not being included in that decision. The girlfriend's response, however, was defensive and disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be part of the decision-making. The girlfriend's failure to involve him is the main issue here. While her need for support is valid, the way she handled the situation and dismissed his feelings might make her the one at fault. The author's suggestion of his own mom might not be the best approach, but the initial problem was her not consulting him. So the answer might hinge on the lack of communication rather than the specific request.\n"
