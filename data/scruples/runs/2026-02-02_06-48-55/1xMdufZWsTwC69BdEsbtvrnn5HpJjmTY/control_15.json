Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby, and she wants her mom to stay for a few weeks before and after the birth. The author is upset she didn't consult him, even though he's part of the shared home. He wants to invite his own mom for support, but she responds negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he isn't doing the \"real work\" of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is dealing with the physical and emotional stress of pregnancy and childbirth. It's common for her to seek support from her mother. But the author feels left out of the decision-making process because it's their shared home. The key issue here is communication and feeling excluded. When she didn't ask him first, he might feel his input was disregarded. Then, when he suggests his own support, her response is dismissive, which could be seen as invalidating his need for help, even though he's not the one giving birth.\n\nThe author's reaction is about wanting support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response might be hurtful, as it downplays his role in caring for the baby and the household, which is a big responsibility. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his mother's support. Since both partners should have their needs considered, the girlfriend's reaction might be the real problem here. The author isn't wrong for seeking support, especially if he's also going to be involved in parenting. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
