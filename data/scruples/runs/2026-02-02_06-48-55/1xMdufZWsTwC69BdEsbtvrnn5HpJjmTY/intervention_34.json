      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay over for support. The author, the boyfriend, is upset because she didn't consult him about his mom coming over. When he suggests inviting his mom, the girlfriend gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is pregnant and likely stressed, so seeking support from her mother is understandable. She might feel that her needs are more critical during this time. On the other hand, the author feels that since they share a home, he should have been involved in the decision. His request to include his mother is a way to balance the support system, but the girlfriend's reaction is dismissive and rude, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's main issue is not that he wants his mom there, but that he wasn't included in the initial decision. It's a valid point because major life events like pregnancy affect both partners. The girlfriend's response, calling him an asshole and minimizing his role, seems unfair. However, the author's initial reaction might have been to push back by suggesting his mom, which could be seen as reactive. But the core issue is the lack of communication and consideration for each other's needs.\n\nI think the girlfriend's response is definitely in the wrong for being disrespectful and not acknowledging his feelings. The author, while perhaps not handling it perfectly, has a valid grievance about being excluded. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are worse, but the author's approach might not be ideal either. However, given the context, the main fault lies with the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
