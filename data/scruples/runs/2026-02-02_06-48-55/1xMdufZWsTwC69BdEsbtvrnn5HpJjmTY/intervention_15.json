I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend (now his wife, I assume) planning for her mother to stay with them for several weeks around the baby's arrival. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and felt excluded when she mentioned it. He then suggested his mother should come for support too, but she dismissed him, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author didn't know about the plans until after they were made. In a shared home, major decisions like having a family member stay for several weeks should involve both partners. So, the girlfriend not consulting him is a point of contention. However, when the author tried to reciprocate by suggesting his mother, the girlfriend's response was harsh and dismissive. \n\nNow, considering the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend was seeking support during a vulnerable time, which is understandable. But her not discussing the living arrangements with her partner shows a lack of communication. On the other hand, the author's reaction\u2014feeling entitled to the same support\u2014might come off as a bit self-centered, especially since pregnancy and postpartum are typically seen as the mother's primary experience. However, the author's right to feel involved in household decisions is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's response, calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support, is clearly inappropriate. She shouldn't have dismissed his feelings. But the author also didn't approach the situation with empathy. Maybe he should have acknowledged her need for support first and then negotiated the terms of his mother's visit. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties have valid points here. The girlfriend should have included him in the decision, and the author should have expressed his need for support without making it a direct comparison. However, the girlfriend's harsh reaction is more damaging. The author's main issue was not being informed, which is a legitimate grievance. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The responsibility isn't solely on him. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
