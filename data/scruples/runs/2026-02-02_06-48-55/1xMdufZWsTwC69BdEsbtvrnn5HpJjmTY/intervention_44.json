Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the birth. The author didn't like that she didn't consult him first. When he brought it up, she dismissed his concern and even called him an asshole when he suggested his own mom could help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and planning for the baby's arrival. It's common for parents to seek support during such times. Her decision to have her mom stay might be driven by the need for help with the baby, household tasks, or emotional support. However, the key point here is that she didn't include her partner in this decision. Shared living arrangements mean that both partners should have a say in who is living in their home, especially for an extended period. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling excluded. He's upset that his opinion wasn't considered. When he brought it up, his girlfriend didn't address his feelings but instead dismissed him and belittled his need for support. That's a problem. Both partners' needs should be considered. The author's suggestion to invite his mom is a valid response because it's about mutual support. However, the way he phrased it might come off as confrontational, but the main issue is her not consulting him first.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the conversation differently. Instead of countering with his own mom, maybe he could have discussed the importance of shared decision-making. But the girlfriend's response was clearly dismissive and hostile. She invalidated his feelings, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did express his feelings, and his desire for support is reasonable. However, the way he reacted (by suggesting his own mom) might not have been the best approach. But the main issue is her not consulting him. The support system for both parents is important. The girlfriend's reaction was more problematic because she didn't acknowledge his concerns. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. He had a right to feel that his input was needed. The fact that she didn't ask him first is a major issue. His reaction, while maybe not perfectly handled, is a response to her not including him. Both need to communicate better, but the primary fault lies with her for not involving him. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
