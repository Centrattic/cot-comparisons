Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong in the situation where their pregnant girlfriend didn't ask for their input about her mom staying for support. The author feels left out because they weren't consulted and then the girlfriend dismissed the author's support needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend made a big decision (her mother moving in) without consulting the author, which is a shared home. That's a valid concern. The author then suggests his own mother should come, which the girlfriend dismisses, saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth. \n\nThe author is upset because he wasn't included in the decision, and the girlfriend's response is dismissive. On the one hand, the girlfriend is likely stressed and seeking emotional support, which is natural. On the other, not involving her partner in such a major living arrangement could be problematic, especially since it affects their shared home. The author's reaction is about wanting to be included and feeling his support is undervalued.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author did ask after she made the decision, which shows he's trying to communicate. The girlfriend's response was harsh, which might indicate a deeper issue in their communication. \n\nThe key points are: not being consulted about a significant decision (her mom staying) and the girlfriend's dismissive attitude towards the author's need for support. The author's request to involve his mother is a reasonable attempt to balance things, but his mother's presence would also affect their home. However, the girlfriend's statement about him not needing support because he's not giving birth is problematic. It's true that the physical aspects are different, but emotional and practical support is still important for the partner. Dismissing that can create resentment.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's seeking to be involved and to have his support recognized. The girlfriend's actions (not consulting) and response (being harsh and dismissive) are more concerning. The author's reaction is a response to being excluded and disrespected. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
