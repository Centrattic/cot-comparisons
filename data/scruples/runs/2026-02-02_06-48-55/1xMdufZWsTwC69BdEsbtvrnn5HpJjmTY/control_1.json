Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for several weeks because she's pregnant. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first, since they share the home. When he brought it up, she dismissed his support needs by saying he doesn't have to do any real work. The author then suggested inviting his mom too, but she called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here: The girlfriend made a decision about their shared living space without discussing it with her partner. That's a big deal because they live together, so her mother's presence would affect both of them. The author is upset about not being included in the decision-making process. Then, when he tries to assert his need for support, she invalidates his feelings by saying he doesn't need support because he isn't doing the \"real work\" of childbirth. That seems dismissive and unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think. The author isn't wrong for wanting support. Pregnancy and childbirth are major life events that can strain a relationship. Both partners need support. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic because she's not acknowledging the author's role and his need for emotional support. She's also making a unilateral decision about their shared home, which is a valid concern. The author is justified in expressing his feelings and wanting to involve his mother. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
