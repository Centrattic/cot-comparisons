I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's upset because his pregnant girlfriend asked her mom to stay at their home without consulting him. He feels left out and wants to invite his mother too, but she dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom's support, which is understandable. However, she didn't consult her partner about her mom moving in. The boyfriend then suggests inviting his mom, but she responds negatively. \n\nThe main issue here is communication and mutual decision-making. When a couple is living together, major decisions like having a parent stay for an extended period should be discussed together. The girlfriend didn't ask her partner, which could make him feel excluded or undervalued. On the other hand, the girlfriend's focus on her own needs during a stressful time is also valid. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally taxing, so seeking support is natural.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to want equal support by inviting his mom. However, the girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support could come off as dismissive. This might stem from frustration or stress, but it's not a healthy way to handle the situation. Both parties seem to have valid points but are not considering the other's perspective adequately.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. From a perspective of shared responsibility in a partnership, the girlfriend should have included him in the decision. The boyfriend's desire for support is also reasonable, as partners can benefit from additional help during such times. The girlfriend's dismissive comment (\"you're an asshole\") is unkind and invalidates his feelings, which could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, the initial action of not including him is also a point against her.\n\nBut the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend wanted support and was upset about not being consulted. His response to invite his mom is a way to assert his need for support, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but the core issue is the lack of communication from her side. So, the boyfriend isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe both have some responsibility. However, in these AITA questions, the answer is often B (not in the wrong) if both parties have valid points and the main fault is on the other side. Here, the girlfriend didn't communicate, and her response was dismissive. The boyfriend's stance is reasonable. So the answer might be B.\n"
