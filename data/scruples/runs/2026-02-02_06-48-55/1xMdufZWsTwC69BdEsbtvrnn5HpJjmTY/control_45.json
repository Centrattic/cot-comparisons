      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby's birth. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though they share the home. When he asked, she said her mom is her support, but when he suggested his mom should come too, she called him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that since they live together, major decisions like having someone move in should be mutual. His girlfriend, on the other hand, might be dealing with the stress of pregnancy and looking for help, which she's used to from her mom. Maybe she didn't think about his feelings because she was focused on her own needs.\n\nThe author's reaction to ask his mother to come over seems like a legitimate request for support. It's reasonable for him to want help too, especially since taking care of a newborn is a big responsibility. However, the girlfriend's response was harsh, calling him an asshole. That's not a good way to handle the conversation, especially if she's feeling overwhelmed. But does that make the author right? \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the discussion with more understanding of her stress. Maybe he could have said, \"I understand you need support, and I'd like to have help as well. Let's talk about how we can both get the assistance we need without feeling left out.\" Instead, he might have come across as confrontational by suggesting his mom as a counter. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to feel involved in the decision? Yes. Should he have communicated his needs in a way that's considerate of her feelings? Possibly. The girlfriend's dismissive comment is unkind, but the author's approach might have been a bit defensive or abrupt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Not entirely. He's justified in wanting to be part of the decision and needing support. However, the way he responded might have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's part is also problematic for her harsh reaction and not considering his perspective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for mutual understanding. Here, both have valid points but approached the situation poorly. The author isn't in the wrong because he's reasonable to want support, but the way he handled it could be improved. His girlfriend's response is definitely wrong. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
