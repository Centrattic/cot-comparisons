      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is pregnant and asked her mom to stay for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about her mom staying, even though he has no issue with her mom. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests inviting his mom too, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's correct. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the key issue seems to be about communication and mutual support. The author didn't like that his girlfriend didn't discuss the in-laws staying with him. That's a valid concern because sharing a home means both partners should have a say in such significant living arrangements. So, the girlfriend might be at fault for not including him in the decision.\n\nBut then, when the author suggests his own mom could come, the girlfriend dismisses his need for support. That's a problem too. Both partners should feel their support systems are valid. Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful, and it's not just the mother's responsibility. The author is offering his support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh and maybe invalidating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did express his feelings when he felt excluded, which is okay. His request for his mom to come might be seen as trying to balance the situation, not just being selfish. The girlfriend's response was probably more inappropriate because she dismissed his support needs and called him an asshole. That's not constructive.\n\nBut maybe the author should have discussed it more calmly or considered the girlfriend's stress. However, the main issue is that the girlfriend didn't consult him first. Both sides have issues, but the girlfriend's reaction seems worse. So, the author isn't entirely wrong. He's advocating for his own needs, which is fair. The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic here.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he had a right to express his feelings and request support. The girlfriend's response was the bigger problem.\n"
