I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but their girlfriend is bringing in her mom without consulting him and seems dismissive when he suggests his mom should come too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels upset because they share a home and the decision to have the girlfriend's mom stay was made without his input. That's a valid point because when you're in a shared living situation, especially a partnership, major decisions affecting the household should involve both people. The girlfriend's response\u2014that her mom is her support and the author doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work\"\u2014might be dismissive. It could come off as invalidating the author's feelings and not considering his need for support, even if his role is different.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be under a lot of stress due to pregnancy and might see her mother's support as essential. Maybe she didn't realize the author would also need support or that the household arrangement would affect him. But the key issue here is communication. The author was excluded from the decision-making process, which is a problem in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction when he brings up his own need for support by suggesting his mother is another issue. Calling him an asshole and dismissing his needs is not a healthy way to handle the situation.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong. While it's possible the girlfriend had good intentions, the way she handled the situation\u2014excluding him and belittling his needs\u2014is problematic. The author is justified in feeling that his input matters, especially since they live together. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
