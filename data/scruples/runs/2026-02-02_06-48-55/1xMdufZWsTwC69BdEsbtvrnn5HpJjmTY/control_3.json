      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend didn't consult him when she arranged for her mother to stay with them for two weeks before the baby's arrival and a month afterward. The girlfriend didn't consider the author's feelings and dismissed his suggestion to bring his mother for support, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: communication and respect. The author is upset that his partner didn't include him in the decision-making process about their shared home. It's a significant change involving their living space, and the author feels his opinion was ignored. The girlfriend's response that her mom is her support is understandable, as pregnancy and childbirth are physically and emotionally demanding. However, her dismissing the author's request for his mother's support by calling him an asshole and implying he doesn't need help seems dismissive and invalidating.\n\nThe author's request for support isn't unreasonable. Even though the mother might not be doing medical work, emotional and practical support from family can be crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress, but it's important to acknowledge both partners' needs. The key here is mutual respect and collaboration. The author has a right to feel his input was disregarded, especially since they share the home. The girlfriend's response could be seen as undermining the author's role and contributions, which is a red flag in the relationship.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the context of pregnancy. The girlfriend might be overwhelmed, and her priority is her own support system. But that doesn't negate the author's valid feelings about shared decision-making. The fact that she didn't communicate her plans to him is a problem. Relationships require both partners to consider each other's perspectives. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have his mother stay for support; it's a reasonable request. The girlfriend's dismissive attitude is more concerning, but the author's initial frustration is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for who acted disrespectfully. The author's anger is due to lack of communication, which is a valid issue. The girlfriend's response was harsh and invalidating. While the author's reaction might come off as a bit pettish (since it's about wanting his own support), the main fault lies in the girlfriend not involving him. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
