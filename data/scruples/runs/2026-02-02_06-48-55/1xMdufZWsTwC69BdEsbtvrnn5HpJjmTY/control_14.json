Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mother to stay with them for several weeks. The author (the boyfriend) is upset because she didn't consult him first. When he asks about it, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests inviting his mom as well, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication and fairness. The girlfriend didn't discuss the living arrangement with her boyfriend, which is a valid concern because they share a home. The boyfriend's response was to propose his own mother's visit, which the girlfriend took as an insult. She dismisses his need for support, which might be oversimplifying the situation. While pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding for the mother, the partner also goes through significant stress and changes. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh and dismissive. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did bring up his own mother as a counterpoint, which could be seen as trying to have equal support. However, maybe he should have first asked why she didn't consult him and discussed the logistics together. His initial reaction might have been a bit confrontational. On the other hand, the girlfriend's response was clearly hurtful and dismissive. \n\nBut the key issue is that she didn't involve him in the decision. That's a big part of shared living. The author's request for support is reasonable, and her response was not supportive. So, the author isn't entirely without fault if he could have approached it more collaboratively, but her actions and reaction are problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't communicate with him, he's justified in feeling upset. But the way he responded by bringing in his mother might not have been the best approach. It's a bit of a gray area, but the main fault might lie with the girlfriend for not discussing it first. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
