Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support, but not discussing it with her partner first. The partner then wants to invite his mom too but is dismissed by the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The girlfriend didn't consult her partner about her mother staying at their shared home. That's a problem because it's their home, and both should have a say in who's living there temporarily. The partner wanted to invite his mom as well, which is a reasonable response to show support during the baby's arrival. However, the girlfriend called him an asshole and dismissed his request, which seems unfair.\n\nThe key points are: 1. The girlfriend didn't communicate the plan for her mom's visit. 2. The partner is seeking support by wanting his mom to stay. 3. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh and dismissive.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the partner) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if the partner's actions were wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't consult him, his response to propose inviting his mom is valid. He's asserting his right to support as well. The girlfriend's refusal and the derogatory comment might be the issue here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The real issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
