Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a few weeks. The author didn't like that she didn't ask him first and suggested his mom should come too. The girlfriend called him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nHmm. So first, the author wants support when the baby arrives. That makes sense because having a new baby is a big deal. Both partners might need help. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, which is a problem because it's their shared home. The author's reaction is to suggest his own mom, which the girlfriend dismissed. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's upset about not being included in the decision. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and maybe a bit rude. She's implying that his support isn't necessary, which might not be fair. The author is asking for support, which is reasonable. Maybe the girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
