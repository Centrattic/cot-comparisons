Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend expecting her mom to move in for support during the pregnancy, and the author feels left out because she didn't consult him first. The author then suggests inviting his own mom, but the girlfriend dismisses him, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is pregnant and might feel the need for support. It's common for new parents to rely on family help, especially during postpartum. However, the girlfriend didn't discuss this with her partner, which is a problem. The author is upset about not being included in the decision-making process for their shared home. \n\nThen, when the author suggests his mom coming over, the girlfriend's response is dismissive. She says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work. That's a key point. The author is right to feel that his needs and contributions are being overlooked. The girlfriend's statement is invalidating and could be harmful to the relationship. \n\nThe author is expressing a valid need for support and partnership. He's not wrong for wanting his needs to be acknowledged. The girlfriend's reaction shows a lack of communication and empathy. Since the author is advocating for mutual support and shared decision-making, he's not in the wrong. The issue lies with the girlfriend's unilateral decision and dismissive attitude. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
