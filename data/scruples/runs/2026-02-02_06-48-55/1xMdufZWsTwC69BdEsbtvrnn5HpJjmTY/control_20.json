      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before and after the baby is born. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they live together. When he mentions his own need for support, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need it because he won't be doing the real work (i.e., not giving birth).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's main grievance is that his partner didn't consult him about having her mother stay, which affects their shared home. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and implies his support isn't necessary. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should have a say in decisions that affect their home. The girlfriend's unilateral decision might be seen as overstepping, especially without discussing it with her partner. On the other hand, the author's reaction could be considered reasonable in seeking support as well. However, his response was to propose his mother staying, which the girlfriend found offensive. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth is problematic. It's true that pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding, but postpartum support is important for both parents. The author's need for support isn't invalid just because he's not the one giving birth. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress or the challenges of pregnancy, but her response was dismissive and hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for wanting support. The issue is more about communication and mutual consideration. The girlfriend should have discussed the arrangement with the author first. The author's frustration is valid because shared living spaces require joint decisions. However, his approach might have been to express his feelings first before suggesting his mother's visit. But the core issue is that the girlfriend didn't include him in the decision-making, which is a significant problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication and her dismissive attitude. The author's desire for support is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
