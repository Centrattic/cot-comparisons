I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for several weeks before and after the baby is born. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares the home, so it's a joint living space. The girlfriend's decision to have her mom stay without consulting him is a point of contention. The author wants equal consideration for his support needs, which seems reasonable. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and maybe even belittling, which could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings and contributions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The girlfriend's action of not involving her partner in the decision could be a mistake. However, the author's response of suggesting his own mother might come could be seen as a way to assert his needs. The key issue is communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's reaction (\"you're an asshole\") is clearly inappropriate, but does that mean the author was in the wrong for wanting support?\n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel supported. The author's request for support isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's dismissiveness and the lack of initial communication from her side are problematic. The author's frustration likely stems from feeling excluded and not having his needs considered. So, while the author might have a valid point about wanting support, the situation is complex. However, the girlfriend's actions (not discussing the move) and her response (calling him an asshole) are more clearly in the wrong. The author, while perhaps not wrong, might have handled it differently. But given the scenario, the main fault lies with the girlfriend. So, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
