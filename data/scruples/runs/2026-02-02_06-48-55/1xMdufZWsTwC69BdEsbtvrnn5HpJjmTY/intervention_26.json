Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for support during and after the pregnancy. The author (the guy) didn't like that she didn't ask him first. When he mentioned it, she dismissed his need for support.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. So, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The girlfriend is probably stressed and wants her mom, which is understandable. But the author felt left out in the decision-making. He asked to have his mom involved too, but she refused, saying he doesn't need support because he isn't doing the physical work. \n\nWait, pregnancy and childbirth are tough on the mother, so her needing support is valid. But the author, as the partner, might feel he should be involved in decisions about their home. The issue is about shared responsibility and respect. The girlfriend didn't consider his feelings by not consulting him first. Then, when he tried to assert his need for support, she dismissed him, implying his role isn't important. That's problematic. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for wanting support? Well, partners should support each other. The girlfriend's mother coming over is a big change, and she should have discussed it with the author. But the author also has a right to feel that his needs are valid. However, expecting his mother to come for support might be a different situation. The argument here is about mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend didn't communicate well, and the author's response might be a bit reactive. \n\nBut the core issue is that the author wants to be a supportive partner and feels his partner isn't acknowledging his role. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth could be dismissive of his emotional needs. So maybe the author isn't wrong. However, he should have approached it differently, perhaps by discussing the implications of her mother staying in their home rather than immediately suggesting his own mother. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's actions are causing a rift. She should have included him in the conversation about her mom staying. The author's frustration is justified in that aspect. But when he brings up his own need for support, it might come off as trying to balance the scales, which could be seen as self-centered. \n\nWait, but supporting a partner through pregnancy is a shared responsibility. The author might need support too, especially in terms of being a good partner. So, the girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge his need for support is where the problem lies. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting support; the issue is the girlfriend's response and lack of communication. \n\nSo, the answer might be B. The author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's failure to communicate and respect his feelings, not the author's desire for support.\n"
