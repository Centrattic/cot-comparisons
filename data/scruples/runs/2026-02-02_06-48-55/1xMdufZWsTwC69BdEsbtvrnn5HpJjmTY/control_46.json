I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend (now expecting) is asking her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author (the guy) is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he's okay with her mom. When he asked about it, she said her mom is her support. He then suggested inviting his mom too, but she called him an asshole and said he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author feels left out of the decision-making process since they share the home. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which he found disrespectful. Her response about him not needing support because he's not the one doing the work is problematic. Pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding, but both partners go through significant changes and challenges. The author is valid in wanting support, especially since they live together. The girlfriend's dismissive and derogatory comment (\"asshole\") is a red flag. It's important to consider if her response was justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is stressed due to pregnancy and feeling overwhelmed. However, even if that's the case, the way she responded is not constructive. The author's request to have his mom stay is about mutual support, not just his own needs. It's reasonable for both partners to have support systems, especially during such a big life change. The fact that she didn't consult him initially is a communication issue. The author's reaction to suggest his mom is a logical extension of wanting equal support. So, the girlfriend's harsh response seems to be the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the problem lies in her response and lack of communication.\n"
