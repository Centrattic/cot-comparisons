I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for support during pregnancy and after birth. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first because they share the home. The girlfriend then dismissed his suggestion to have his mom help, saying he doesn't need support.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From the description, the author is upset about being excluded from a decision that affects their shared home. It's reasonable for him to feel that since they live together, major decisions like having someone move in should involve both partners. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (like carrying the baby) could be seen as dismissive of his role in supporting her during this time. \n\nHowever, pregnancy and childbirth are significant events, and the need for emotional and practical support is valid for the expectant mother. The girlfriend might feel that her own mother's support is crucial for her well-being. On the other hand, the author's reaction\u2014asking to bring his mom in\u2014might be about feeling entitled to support too, even if indirectly. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem. But the author's response of calling for his mom might be seen as a reaction to being dismissed. It's a bit of a back-and-forth. The author's primary issue is being left out of the decision, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's dismissal could be seen as invalidating his feelings. So, while both have valid points, the main fault might lie with the girlfriend for not involving him in the decision, but the author's reaction could be seen as a justified pushback. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to be involved and seeking support, especially since they share the home. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
