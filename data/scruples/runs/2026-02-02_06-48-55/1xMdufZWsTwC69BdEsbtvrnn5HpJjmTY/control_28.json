      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay with them for support. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and when he suggested his mom come too, she dismissed his request.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and dealing with the stress of childbirth, so needing support makes sense. She didn't consult her partner about her mom staying, which is a big decision since they share the home. The author then asks if he can invite his mom too, but she responds negatively, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he might feel overlooked because the home is shared. He has a right to input on who lives there. On the other hand, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable time and might need more support. But she didn't include him in the decision-making. The author's response to suggest his mom might be a bit reactive, but his main issue is not being consulted. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support could be seen as dismissive and invalidating. \n\nSo maybe the author isn't wrong for wanting to be involved in the decision. The key here is communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him first, which is problematic. The author's reaction is about wanting to be part of the decision process. The girlfriend's response is harsh and maybe underestimates the author's role. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to be part of decisions affecting their shared home. The girlfriend's actions and response could be the main issue here.\n"
