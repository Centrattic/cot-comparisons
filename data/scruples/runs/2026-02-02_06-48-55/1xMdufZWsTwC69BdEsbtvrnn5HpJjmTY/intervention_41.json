Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a person whose girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for about three weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he brings it up, she dismisses his concern by saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one doing the \"real work\" of childbirth.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be communication. The girlfriend didn't discuss this plan with the author before making it, which is a common problem in relationships. When he asked, she was defensive and made a comment about his need for support. The author then suggests inviting his own mom, which is a reasonable response given that he's part of the household and the impending addition of a baby.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that her mother is her support, implying that the author isn't providing enough support. But childbirth is a huge life event, and both parents typically go through a lot. The author is probably feeling left out or not considered in the planning. It's true that the physical labor of childbirth is on the mother, but the emotional and practical support for the father is also important. The fact that the girlfriend didn't consult her partner about such a significant change to their living situation could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might be a bit harsh. He could have approached the situation with more understanding first, considering that the mother is providing necessary emotional support. However, the girlfriend's response of calling him an asshole is definitely not ideal. That's a strong and hurtful reaction, especially in a time when cooperation is crucial. The author is just asserting his need for support as well, which is valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. The girlfriend's lack of communication and her dismissive attitude might be the bigger issue here. The author is reacting to her not including him, which is a reasonable response. But he could have been more empathetic in his initial reaction. However, the key point is that the girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision, leading to his frustration. The author's right to feel that way is justified. The girlfriend's response, though, is where the problem lies, as it's disrespectful and invalidates his feeling of needing support. \n\nIn such situations, both parties might have some responsibility, but the girlfriend's actions here\u2014making a decision without discussing it and being derogatory\u2014seem more at fault. The author is just trying to express that he also needs support, which is a normal part of a relationship. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
