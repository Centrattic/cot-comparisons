Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he's okay with her mom. The girlfriend then dismisses his concern by saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting support. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend made a decision that affects their shared home without discussing it with the author. That's a big deal because they live together and it's a joint responsibility. Even if the author is okay with her mom staying, not being included in the decision-making process is a valid concern. \n\nThen, when the author brings it up, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and belittling. She calls him an asshole and invalidates his need for support. That's not a healthy way to handle the situation. Both partners should have equal say in decisions that impact their living situation. The author's desire to have his own support system, like his mom, is reasonable. Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful for both partners, and support systems are important for everyone involved.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for wanting to be involved in the decision. The girlfriend's reaction is the problem here. She's not respecting his input, which could lead to more issues. The author is standing up for his right to be part of the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
