I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend asking her mom to stay at their shared home without consulting him. The author is upset because he wasn't included in the decision and feels he should also be able to have his mom stay for support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's girlfriend might feel that she needs more support during pregnancy and the postpartum period. It's common for people to seek help from family during such times. However, the key issue here is that she didn't discuss it with her partner first. Shared living spaces require mutual agreement, so not involving the other person in a decision that affects both could be problematic.\n\nThe author's reaction is to feel hurt and to suggest his own mother should come, which he's entitled to. But his girlfriend's response is dismissive, saying he doesn't need support. That could be a valid point if the author isn't experiencing similar stress, but the author is asking for support, which is reasonable. However, the initial problem is the lack of communication from the girlfriend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't ask her to come up with a plan together. He was upset about not being included, which is understandable. The girlfriend's response was harsh, calling him an asshole without considering his feelings. The author's request for his mother to stay is a reasonable reaction to being excluded. So, maybe the girlfriend is more in the wrong here. But the question is about the author. Since he didn't communicate his expectations beforehand and was upset about not being included, but he's asserting his right to support, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the main issue is the lack of discussion. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting support or feeling unconsulted. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
