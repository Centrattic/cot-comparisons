      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for several weeks around the time of the baby's arrival. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he brought it up, she dismissed his concerns and even said he should invite his own mom, which she then rejected, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is communication. The author feels that since they share the home, major decisions like having someone move in should be mutual. The girlfriend didn't discuss it with him beforehand, which is a valid concern. Shared living spaces often require mutual agreement on significant changes, especially those involving others moving in for extended periods. That's a common expectation in relationships, especially when cohabiting.\n\nThen, when the author raises the issue, the girlfriend's response is dismissive. She tells him he's an asshole and invalidates his need for support. This comes off as disrespectful and possibly controlling. The author's reaction\u2014suggesting his own mother could come for support\u2014was a logical response to her implying he doesn't need help. Her reaction to that is unkind and undermines his feelings. It's important in relationships to validate each other's needs, even if there are disagreements.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that only the mother-to-be needs support. While it's true that pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding, the partner also needs support. The author is expressing a need for help, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's dismissal of that could lead to resentment, as the partner feels unsupported and undervalued.\n\nLooking at relationship dynamics, communication is key. The girlfriend's failure to discuss the living arrangement is a breach of shared decision-making. The author's frustration is understandable. Her reaction to his concerns, however, is problematic. It's not just about the mother staying but how she handled the conversation. Disrespectful communication can erode trust and cooperation in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be involved in decisions about their home and for seeking support. The girlfriend's actions and words were the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
