      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend asking her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, and when he suggests his mom might come too, she reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work\" (which I assume refers to childbirth). \n\nSo, the user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is asking her mom to stay. That's a common support system for expecting parents. But the author is upset that she didn't discuss it with him first. They share a home, so it's reasonable for him to want input in decisions that affect the household. Communication is key in relationships, so not involving the partner in such a significant decision could be a problem. \n\nThen, when the author suggests asking his mom for support, the girlfriend dismisses him, implying he doesn't need help because he's not the one giving birth. This seems unfair. Even though the physical demands of childbirth are on the mother, both parents go through major life changes and could benefit from support. The girlfriend's response might be a way of handling stress, but it's not considerate of the author's need for support. \n\nThe author is expressing a desire for help and partnership, which is valid. However, the way he responded might not have been the best. Instead of countering with his own request, he could have expressed his feelings about not being consulted and asked for a discussion. But the girlfriend's reaction was dismissive and disrespectful, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he felt wronged by not being included in the decision and his request for support is legitimate, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, his approach might have been confrontational. The girlfriend's response is more concerning because she's belittling his needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel supported. The fact that the girlfriend is in a vulnerable state (pregnant) doesn't mean her partner's needs are less valid. It's a shared responsibility, and support systems for both parents are important. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. The issue seems to stem from communication problems and differing expectations about support during a stressful time. The girlfriend's reaction is more problematic because she's invalidating the author's feelings. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
