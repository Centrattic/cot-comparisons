Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support, but not discussing it with her partner. The partner then feels left out and wants to invite his mom too, but the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the work.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans with her partner. That's a big deal because they share a home. Major decisions like having a parent move in should involve both partners. The author's reaction is about feeling excluded and seeking support, which is valid. He's not asking to have his mom stay necessarily, but he's pointing out the inconsistency in her logic. She says her mom is her support, but when he suggests he might need support too, she invalidates that.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly unfair. Pregnancy is a big life event, and both partners might need support in different ways. The author is asserting his right to have his needs considered, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's argument that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth overlooks the emotional and practical support a partner might need during this time. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included in these decisions and seeking mutual support. The key here is communication and mutual respect for each other's needs. The girlfriend's failure to include him in the initial decision is a problem, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out and wanting to address his own support needs.\n"
