I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple dealing with the arrival of their baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby is born. The author is upset that she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. When he brought it up, she dismissed his support needs by saying he doesn't have to do any real work. The author then considers inviting his mom too, but she calls him an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding a significant change in their home. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which might be a valid point because it's their shared home. On the other hand, the author's response was to suggest his mom come over without discussing it with her first. Then he got defensive when she dismissed his support needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be due to stress from pregnancy and the impending responsibilities. She might feel that her needs are more pressing, but that doesn't mean she's right to dismiss his feelings. However, the author's approach of immediately suggesting his mom without discussing it with her might have come off as confrontational. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties should express their needs and listen to each other. The author has a right to feel supported, but his method of expressing that (by suggesting his mom without prior discussion) could be seen as reactive. The girlfriend's response was harsh, but the author's initial action might have provoked that. \n\nConsidering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author brought up his mom in response without mutual discussion, maybe he is partly at fault for not addressing the issue more collaboratively. The core issue is about shared decision-making in their home. If the author had first expressed his feelings about not being consulted and then discussed the possibility of his mom coming over, maybe the situation could have been resolved better. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not approaching the conversation more constructively.\n"
