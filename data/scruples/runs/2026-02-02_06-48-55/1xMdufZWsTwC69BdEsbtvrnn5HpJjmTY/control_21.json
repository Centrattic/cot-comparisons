      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and asking her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. He then suggests inviting his own mom for support, but she reacts negatively, saying he's an asshole and that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision to have his mother-in-law stay, which is understandable because it affects their shared living space. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be under a lot of stress from the pregnancy and looking for support. But the problem is she didn't consult her partner first, which is a big deal when it comes to shared responsibilities and living arrangements. The author's response to suggest his own mom might have been a mistake if it was confrontational, but his reasoning is that he should get support too. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, implying that the author's role isn't important. However, expecting support during a pregnancy is normal, and not involving the partner in the decision could be seen as dismissive of his input. The author's request for his mother to visit is a reasonable one given the shared responsibility of parenting, even if the immediate physical demands of pregnancy are on the mother. It's about mutual support as a couple. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He has a right to be involved in decisions affecting their home, especially when it's about having someone stay there for an extended period. The girlfriend's response is more problematic, as she's not considering her partner's feelings or the shared nature of their household. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
