      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby, and the girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests inviting his mom too, she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he won't be doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is pregnant, and it's common for expectant mothers to seek support during this time. Her mother's help could be really important for her, especially with the physical and emotional changes during pregnancy and after childbirth. The author is frustrated because he wasn't consulted about the living arrangement. In a shared home, both partners should have a say in who lives there, so that's a valid point. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making plans.\n\nHowever, when the author responds by suggesting his own mother, the girlfriend reacts negatively. She implies that his role isn't as demanding, so he doesn't need support. That seems dismissive of his potential needs. While pregnant women do have specific needs, the partner also plays a significant role in the baby's life and may need emotional and practical support. The girlfriend's response might be invalidating his feelings, which isn't helpful.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mother staying, which is a problem. However, when he brings it up, he responds by suggesting his own mother, which could be seen as a counterpoint but also might be a way to assert his needs. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but the initial action of not consulting him was her mistake. \n\nThe author is upset about not being included in the decision, which is reasonable. However, his response of suggesting his mother might be seen as a bit of a power move, but it's also about wanting support. The girlfriend's comment that he doesn't need support is problematic because it undermines his role. \n\nSo, the girlfriend did wrong by not discussing her mother's stay first, but the author's request for support isn't entirely unreasonable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one asking the question, he's likely feeling wronged, but maybe he's overreacting. The core issue is communication. The girlfriend should have talked to him before making plans, but the author's response might be valid. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's seeking support and feels excluded from a major decision. But he might have handled it differently. However, based on the given information, the main fault is on the girlfriend for not consulting him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
