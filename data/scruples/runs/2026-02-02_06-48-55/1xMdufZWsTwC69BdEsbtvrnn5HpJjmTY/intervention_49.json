I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, and when he suggested his mom could stay too, she dismissed his need for support.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author's girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision about her mother staying. That's a problem because they share a home, so major decisions affecting both should be discussed together. The author feeling upset about not being asked first is valid. \n\nThen, when the author suggests his mom could stay for support, the girlfriend reacts negatively, implying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth. That's a common dynamic where the non-pregnant partner's needs are minimized. The author's request for support is reasonable, especially since having a newborn is a big change for both parents.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his need for support, which is fair. However, maybe he could have approached it differently. Instead of immediately suggesting his mom's visit as a counter, perhaps he could have first expressed his feelings about not being included in the initial decision. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might feel her needs are more valid, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nSo, the author's intention is valid, but maybe the method could be improved. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's dismissive attitude. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his wanting support is unreasonable. I think he's not in the wrong because he's asserting his need for support, even if the approach could be better. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
