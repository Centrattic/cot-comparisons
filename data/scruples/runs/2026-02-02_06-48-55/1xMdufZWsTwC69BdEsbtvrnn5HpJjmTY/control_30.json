I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that since they share a home, the decision to have someone stay there should involve both of them. That makes sense because it's a shared living space, so input from both partners is important. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that she's going through a significant life change (pregnancy) and needs her mother's support, which is understandable. However, she didn't consult the author, which is a point of conflict.\n\nThe author then asks if he should invite his own mom, which the girlfriend rejects. Her response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of childbirth is problematic. It undermines his potential need for emotional or practical support during the transition. However, the author's reaction to her initial decision without his consent might be seen as a reasonable request for inclusion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to be involved in decisions about their shared home is valid. The girlfriend's dismissive response is more concerning, but the author's demand to have his mom come in response might be a bit of a reaction to her not involving him. However, he's justified in wanting support too. It's a bit of a grey area. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to be part of the decision-making, especially regarding their shared living space. The girlfriend's actions and response are more questionable here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
