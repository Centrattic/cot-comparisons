      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The scenario is that the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for several weeks, and the author feels left out because they weren't consulted first. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, saying the author doesn't need support since they aren't doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is upset that their partner didn't ask them about her mom staying in their shared home. It's a valid concern because it's their home too, and major decisions about living arrangements should involve both partners. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling the author an asshole\u2014seems harsh and dismissive. She didn't acknowledge his feelings or the shared nature of their home.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be stressed due to pregnancy and seeking support from her mother, which is a common and understandable need. However, her response invalidates the author's request for support from his own mother, which is also reasonable. Both partners should feel supported during such a significant life event. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect. Not consulting the partner about a major change like a family member staying in the home can be seen as overstepping, especially when the author then tries to reciprocate by suggesting his mother's visit and is met with hostility.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning for a baby, teamwork is crucial. The author is expressing a need for support, which is valid. The girlfriend's dismissal of his needs could be seen as being inconsiderate. However, the author's initial frustration might stem from not being involved in the decision-making process. The situation seems to highlight a breakdown in communication rather than a clear right or wrong. But since the question is about who is in the wrong, the author's actions in wanting support and pointing out the lack of consultation are justified. The girlfriend's reaction and refusal to acknowledge his needs are more problematic.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because his concerns about shared home decisions and seeking support are valid. The girlfriend's response is the issue here.\n"
