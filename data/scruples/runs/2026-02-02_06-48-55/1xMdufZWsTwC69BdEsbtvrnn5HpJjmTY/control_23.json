I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for several weeks. The author feels the girlfriend didn't consult him about this, and when he asked, she dismissed his concern, saying she's the one needing support. The author then suggests his mom should come too, but she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and might be stressed, needing emotional and practical support from her mother. It's common for pregnant women to seek support, especially from family. However, the author is part of the household, so involving his mom would affect their shared home. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a valid point because major decisions about the home should be mutual. The author is entitled to voice his concerns, especially if his mom's presence is also part of the support he wants.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems dismissive and invalidating. By calling the author an asshole and dismissing his need for support, she's not acknowledging that both partners might need different forms of support. The author's request is reasonable, especially if he feels his mom's help would be beneficial. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect in decision-making. Since the girlfriend made a unilateral decision without discussing it with the author, that's a problem. The author's reaction is about wanting to be heard and included in decisions that affect their shared living space.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support and expressing his concerns. The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic here because she didn't include him in the decision and react negatively to his input. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
