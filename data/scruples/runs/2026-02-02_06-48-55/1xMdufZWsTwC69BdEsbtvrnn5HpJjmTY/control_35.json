      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who's pregnant, wants her mom to stay for two weeks pre-birth and a month post-birth. The author feels upset that she didn't ask him first about the arrangement, since they share the home. When he questions her, she responds that her mom is her support, and when he suggests his mom should also come for support, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is upset because the decision to have her mom stay was made without consulting him, which is understandable since they live together. It's a shared living space, so involving the other partner in such a significant arrangement makes sense. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and invalidating. She's pregnant, so she might be under stress, but her reaction to the author's suggestion is confrontational. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable because having a newborn is a major life change that affects both partners.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend feels that the author isn't acknowledging the physical and emotional labor she's going through, hence her comment about him not doing real work. That could be a point of contention. But her response was to call him an asshole, which is harsh and doesn't address the underlying issue constructively. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author wants to be involved in decisions affecting their shared home, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction is both dismissive and hostile. While her needing support is understandable, she should have communicated better and considered the author's feelings. The author's request for his mom's support isn't unreasonable either. Both partners should ideally be on the same page about such arrangements. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's asserting his right to be part of the decision and seeking support. The girlfriend's response is more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
