I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby's arrival. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. When he suggests his own mom should come for support, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly feels that since they live together, major decisions like hosting a parent should involve both of them. That makes sense because it's their home, and having someone stay for so long would affect their living space and routine. It's reasonable for him to want to be included in that decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is pregnant, which is a significant life event. She might feel the need for additional support, especially in the later stages of pregnancy and after childbirth. It's common for expectant mothers to seek help from family during this time. However, her reaction to his suggestion about his own mother coming over seems dismissive and dismisses his role in the process, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe key point here is the lack of communication. The girlfriend didn't consult him before making the arrangement, which is a valid point for the author. But when he brought it up, her response was combative, calling him an asshole. That's where the tension escalates. It's possible she's stressed or overwhelmed, but responding in that way isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should have a say in decisions that affect their shared home. The author isn't wrong to want to be part of the discussion. The girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support is problematic because it undermines his role in the situation. Even if he's not the one giving birth, pregnancy and childbirth are shared experiences, and both partners need emotional and practical support.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting input or for suggesting his own family's support. The girlfriend's reaction was inappropriate, and the initial lack of consultation was her mistake. However, the author's approach might have been to express his feelings without being confrontational. But given the scenario, the main issue is the girlfriend's dismissiveness rather than the author's initial stance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He has valid concerns about shared decision-making and his right to support, especially in a major life event.\n"
