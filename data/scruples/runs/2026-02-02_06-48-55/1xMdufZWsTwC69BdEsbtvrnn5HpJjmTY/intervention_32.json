Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend didn't consult him about having her mom stay for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The girlfriend then dismissed the author's suggestion to have his mom help, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels excluded because he wasn't asked about the plans for his home. That's a valid point. When you live together, major decisions involving the home should be discussed. The girlfriend's mom staying for almost two months is a significant arrangement that affects the living space and dynamics. Not including the partner in that decision could be seen as dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is seeking support, which is understandable. Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful, and having family help is common. But her response to the author's suggestion\u2014calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support\u2014is harsh. She's minimizing his role and needs, which isn't healthy for a relationship. Support during this time is mutual; both parents are going through a big life change. The author's right to feel his needs are being ignored is valid too.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't communicate the plan, and when confronted, her response was hostile. The author's desire for support is reasonable. Expecting help from family is normal, and the author's reaction to ask for his mom's support shows he's trying to be fair. However, he could have approached it differently, maybe expressing his feelings without pushing back immediately. But her reaction was more confrontational. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of both. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. The initial action of the girlfriend was to not discuss the plans, which is a problem. The author's response was to ask for his mom, which is reasonable. Her reaction was the more problematic part. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. He has a valid point about communication and shared responsibility. However, the author might have handled it better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions crossed a line. \n\nGiven that the author was trying to assert his need for support and the girlfriend's response was extreme, the author's stance is more about communication and mutual support. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
