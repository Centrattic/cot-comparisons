Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about the author not supporting his need for help, while she's bringing her mom in.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mother staying, which is a big deal because they share the home. The author feels left out and upset that she didn't include him in the decision. Then, when he suggests his mom should come for support, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need it because he's not doing the \"real work.\" \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should have a say in major decisions affecting their shared living space. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly dismissive of the author's needs. The author is just asking for his needs to be acknowledged, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's comment about not needing support because he's not doing the real work is problematic because parenting is a shared responsibility, and emotional support is valid for both parents. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to support and being included in decisions. The girlfriend's behavior is more at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
