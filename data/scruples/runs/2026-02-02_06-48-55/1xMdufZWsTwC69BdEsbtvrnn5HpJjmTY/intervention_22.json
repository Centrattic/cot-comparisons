Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where the author wanted support from their mother after the baby arrives but was rejected by their girlfriend. The girlfriend's mom is coming to stay, but the author wasn't consulted first. The girlfriend dismissed the author's need for support, saying he doesn't need it because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. The author shares a home with his girlfriend, so major decisions like having someone stay for weeks should involve both. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a valid point. The author then responds by suggesting his mom should come too, which the girlfriend dismisses. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's right to be involved in decisions about their shared home. 2) The girlfriend's dismissive response and the implication that only she needs support. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and communication are crucial. The girlfriend not discussing the arrangement with the author first could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's their shared home. The author's reaction is to seek equal support, which is reasonable. However, the way he responded by suggesting his mom might come across as a tit-for-tat move, which isn't ideal. \n\nBut the main issue is the girlfriend's dismissal of his need for support. Being dismissive about someone's emotional or practical needs can create resentment. The author is valid in feeling that his support needs are being ignored. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the girlfriend's actions are problematic for not including the author and for belittling his support needs. The author might have handled it better by discussing his feelings instead of immediately suggesting his mom, but his desire for support is understandable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
