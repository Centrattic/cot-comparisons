I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support, but she didn't ask the author first. He then suggests inviting his mom, but she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the real work (pregnancy).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is going through pregnancy and childbirth, which is a significant physical and emotional experience. Her needing support makes sense, and her mother's presence could be crucial. However, the author feels left out because he wasn't consulted first, which is valid because they share a home. It's important to involve both partners in decisions affecting their shared living space.\n\nThe author's reaction is to suggest his own mother, which shows he wants to contribute. But her response, calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support, is harsh. The key here is communication. The author might feel his needs are being ignored, especially postpartum, where he might also need help with the baby. But the girlfriend is under stress and might not see it that way.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did mention he has no problem with her mom, just that he wasn't asked. He then tries to include his mom, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is unkind, but the author's intent is valid. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, maybe he could have approached it differently. But the main issue is the lack of communication from her side. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable, especially post-birth. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
