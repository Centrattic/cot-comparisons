Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for several weeks. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and felt excluded. When he mentioned his own mother, she dismissed him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is feeling left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. It's reasonable for him to want to be consulted, especially since they live together. On the other hand, the girlfriend is dealing with pregnancy, which is a significant and stressful time. Her need for support from her mother is understandable. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response to the author's suggestion about his mother seems dismissive and hurtful. By calling him an asshole and invalidating his need for support, she's not addressing his feelings and is instead making a derogatory comment. That's a problem because it undermines his request for support and could strain their relationship further.\n\nThe author's request to involve his mother is about wanting mutual support during this time. It's not just about equal treatment but about the shared responsibility of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh and doesn't acknowledge that the author might also be under stress or need help, even if he isn't the one giving birth.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend should have discussed the plan with the author first. She did ask her mom without consulting him, which is a breach of communication. The author's reaction is a valid response to being excluded. While he might have handled it differently, his core issue is about being involved in decisions affecting their home. The girlfriend's dismissive response is more problematic because it's disrespectful and doesn't foster collaboration.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue lies with the girlfriend's lack of communication and her derogatory reply. The author's desire for support and inclusion is reasonable.\n"
