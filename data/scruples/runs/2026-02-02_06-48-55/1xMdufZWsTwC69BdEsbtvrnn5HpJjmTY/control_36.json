      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is about a couple where the girlfriend (soon to be partner) is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. The girlfriend then says the author doesn't need support since he won't be doing the \"real work\" of parenting.\n\nHmm, first, the author wanted support when the baby arrives. That's a reasonable request, right? Support from family during such a major life change is common. The girlfriend did ask her mom to stay, but she didn't consult the author first. The home is shared, so the author probably feels that her decision to bring her mom in without discussing it with him is dismissive. Then, when he suggests his mom can come too, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the real work. \n\nWait, what's the \"real work\" she's referring to? Typically, pregnancy and childbirth are physically and emotionally demanding for the mother. So maybe she thinks the father's role in those early stages is less involved. But that's a bit problematic because while the mother is carrying and birthing the baby, the father still has a role in providing emotional and logistical support. Also, after the baby is born, both parents share responsibilities. By not allowing his mom to come for support, she might be implying that his needs aren't as important, which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author's main issue is about being excluded from the decision-making process regarding their shared home. Even if her mom is coming for support, the author's input should be considered. Plus, when he proposed his mom, her reaction was hostile. That makes it seem like she's not respecting his feelings or the shared living situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be stressed due to pregnancy and seeking support from her mother. It's possible she didn't think to include her partner in the discussion because of her own stress. But that doesn't excuse not communicating with him, especially since they live together. The home is a shared space, so decisions affecting it should be mutual. \n\nThe author's desire to have his mother's support is valid too. Why should only the mother receive support? The father's role in preparing for the baby is significant, and having family help can ease the transition for both parents. Her response that he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the \"real work\" is dismissive and undermines his contributions. \n\nSo, the key points here are mutual communication in a shared home and respect for each partner's need for support. The girlfriend's actions and words seem to lack both. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. His feelings are justified. He wants to be involved in decisions about their home and is seeking support, which is normal. The girlfriend's reaction and the initial lack of discussion are the issues here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
