We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a one-month relationship where the author, \"Moja,\" turned down a romantic plan on Valentine's Day, even after the guy, Jeremy, had made elaborate plans. The author initially told him she didn't care for the holiday and preferred to work, which she does for extra money. Later, Jeremy, who had been drinking, called her and got upset when she didn't change her mind. He even mentioned plans like dinner, a carriage ride, and a rose petal bath. The author stood her ground, explaining her reasons again, but Jeremy ended up being rude, calling her an asshole and hanging up.\n\nThe author is now torn because Jeremy apologized a bit the next morning, making her question if she should have given him a chance. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, did the author clearly state her plans? Yes, she told him directly on Sunday that she didn't care for Valentine's Day and wanted to work. That's clear communication. Jeremy, however, proceeded to plan something elaborate despite not being in a committed relationship. The story mentions the relationship isn't super intense yet\u2014seeing each other 2-3 times a week, but nothing too serious. So, maybe Jeremy assumed more than there was. He might have misread the relationship's status.\n\nThen there's the fact that Jeremy approached her drunk. That can affect his judgment and behavior. His tirade and yelling might be partly due to being under the influence. The author's response was to stick to her decision and explain her reasons, which seem valid\u2014she needs the money for a trip and doesn't care for the holiday. She's not opposed to romantic gestures, just not for this specific day. \n\nJeremy's reaction was inappropriate, calling her an asshole and ending the call. That's not healthy behavior in a relationship, especially early on. The author's actions were honest and clear. She didn't change her mind despite his efforts, which could be seen as respectful of her boundaries. On the other hand, Jeremy planning such a big gesture so soon might have been pushing for something more serious than the author was ready for. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author communicated her stance clearly, and Jeremy had the choice to either respect that or not. Since he didn't, and instead got upset and acted disrespectfully, the fault isn't with the author. She's not obligated to change her plans because someone else made assumptions. The user might think the author should have been more flexible, but the story shows she's consistent in her preferences and communicated them upfront. Jeremy's overreaction and lack of respect for her decision are the issues here. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
