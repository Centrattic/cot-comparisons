We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. So, the author is dating Jeremy for a month, and when he asked about Valentine's Day plans, she said she would rather work. Then he got upset after revealing his romantic plans. She's now torn on whether she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the relationship's status, communication, and expectations. The author was clear from the start that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work. Jeremy made elaborate plans after knowing her for a month. She might feel that she made her stance clear, but he still proceeded with the plans. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The author is not obligated to celebrate Valentine's Day if she doesn't want to. Her reasons are understandable\u2014work and saving money. She did communicate her preference when he asked. However, Jeremy might have felt that since they are in a relationship, he expected her to be there. But the problem is that the relationship isn't very long, and maybe he overstepped by making big plans without confirming her availability again. \n\nAlso, the fact that she had already stated her preference before he made the plans could be a point in her favor. However, maybe she should have re-emphasized her decision when he revealed the plans. But she did clarify again when he asked her to reconsider. \n\nThe user's feelings of being torn might be more about self-doubt rather than actual wrongdoing. The core issue is about differing expectations and communication. Since she was clear and he proceeded, it's more on him. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if there was a prior agreement or if she gave mixed signals. But from the text, she was direct. So I think B is correct.\n"
