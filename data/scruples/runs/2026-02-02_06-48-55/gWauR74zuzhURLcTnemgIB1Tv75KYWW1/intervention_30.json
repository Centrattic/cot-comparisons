We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the woman, Moja, told Jeremy she prefers to work on Valentine's Day instead of celebrating, even after he made elaborate plans. Now, they're arguing about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating about a month, seen each other 2-3 times a week. She doesn't feel a strong spark yet but likes him. When he asked about Valentine's plans, she was clear she'd work. Then he called her after drinking, said she's acting like an asshole, and hung up. She's torn because she felt she was clear but maybe should've considered his feelings more.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, she communicated her preference upfront. She mentioned not caring for the holiday and that working is better for her. He made plans after that, which might not have been his wisest move. She had the right to prioritize her work and personal preferences. Relationships require respecting each other's boundaries, and she did that.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeremy was hurt and felt rejected. He put effort into planning, expecting her to change her mind. She could have been more empathetic, even if she was clear. However, she wasn't obligated to change her plans just because he made them. The problem might be on his side for not understanding her priorities and reacting poorly, especially while drunk.\n\nThe key here is whether Moja overstepped by sticking to her initial communication. Since she was clear and he ignored that, she's not at fault. His reaction was the issue. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But need to check if there's any nuance. Maybe she could have softened her message, but she was clear and he misread the signals. His actions (drunk call, insults) were worse. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
