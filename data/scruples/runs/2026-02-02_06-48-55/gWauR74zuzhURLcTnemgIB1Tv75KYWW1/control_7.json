We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her Moja, is dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super passionate relationship yet. Jeremy asked her about her Valentine's Day plans, and she told him straight up that she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work because it's good money. Later, even after he told her he made these big plans (reservation at a nice restaurant, carriage ride, rose petal bath), she reiterated her decision to work and mention her Eurail trip as a reason. He then called her an asshole and hung up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship after a month. Valentine's Day is a romantic holiday, so maybe Jeremy felt that having a special plan was important. But Moja was clear about not wanting to celebrate and preferring to work. She also mentioned that they're not at the \"kiss goodbye\" stage yet, so maybe the relationship isn't serious enough for that kind of pressure. \n\nWhen Jeremy asked her about her plans, she answered honestly. Then even after he shared his elaborate plans, she didn't change her mind. But then she's questioning if she should have been more considerate. However, he was the one who made the plans, assuming she wanted a romantic gesture. She didn't commit to anything when he asked, so it's his decision to make the plans, not hers. \n\nMoja's reasoning is that she's saving for her trip and prefers working. It's her choice to prioritize work, especially if she's clear about it. Jeremy's reaction might be over the top, but does that mean Moja is wrong for not backing down? Maybe not. She was straightforward, and it's his responsibility to accept her answer. However, maybe she could have been a bit more empathetic. But given that he was drunk and then called her an asshole, that's his fault for reacting poorly. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't been intimate yet might mean the relationship isn't deep enough for such grand gestures. Jeremy might have had higher expectations than Moja's. She's not required to go along with his plans if she's not interested in the holiday. So I think the answer is B, not the author. She was clear, and his reaction is his issue.\n"
