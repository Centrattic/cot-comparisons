We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Jeremy she'd rather work on Valentine's Day despite his elaborate plans. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Jeremy have been dating for a month. They see each other 2-3 times a week. The author mentions it's not a \"fireworks\" situation but they like each other and maybe there's potential for more. So the relationship is in an early stage, not super intense yet.\n\nOn Sunday, Jeremy takes her to a hockey game, which she likes. As they're parting, he asks about her Valentine's Day plans. She tells him directly that she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work because it's good money. At this point, she's clear about her plans. Then later, he calls her drunk and starts a tirade about his plans\u2014reservation at a fancy restaurant, carriage ride, rose petal bath. She apologizes for being on the schedule but stands by her decision. He gets angry, says she's acting like an asshole, and ends the call. The next morning, he sends a non-apology apology, making her feel conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here: She was clear about her plans when he first asked. He then went ahead and made these plans without checking in again. She's choosing to work, which is her choice, and he's upset because he put effort into something she didn't want. The author is questioning if it's her fault because she didn't tell him about her Eurail trip earlier, which might have been a factor in her decision to work.\n\nBut wait, she did tell him she wasn't into Valentine's Day and would rather work. So she was explicit. He's the one who didn't take that into account and made plans regardless. The author isn't obligated to accommodate his romantic plans if she clearly stated her preference. Also, the fact that they haven't even kissed yet might indicate that the relationship isn't at a point where such grand gestures are expected.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she could have been more considerate of his feelings. But she did explain her reasons\u2014prioritizing work and not valuing the holiday. The problem is that he didn't respect her initial refusal and pushed further. His reaction of calling her an asshole is his fault for overreacting. The author's main responsibility was to communicate her choice, which she did. She's not in the wrong for sticking to her decision after being clear.\n"
