We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy named Jeremy who planned a romantic Valentine's Day for their one-month relationship. The author, Moja, told him upfront she didn't care for Valentine's and preferred to work. Then later, when he called her drunk and upset because she changed her mind, they had a fight. Now she's confused if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: Moja was clear about not celebrating V-Day and working. Jeremy planned a big date after knowing that. She didn't back down when he tried to get her to reconsider. But he made plans based on her initial response. She felt he should have known she wasn't into that. But he was upset and called her an asshole, then hung up.\n\nSo, was she wrong? Well, she was upfront. You can't really blame her for sticking to her plans. Jeremy might have misinterpreted her initial statement or thought she was just saying that. But he went ahead and planned something elaborate, which she wasn't going to change. Did she have to work, which she mentioned before. Also, she's saving for a trip. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he thought they were closer than they were. The relationship is only a month old, so maybe he expected a commitment. But she had only seen him a few times a week, not every day. The problem is that he made plans after she said she didn't want to do that. But she had already confirmed she was working. Maybe he should have known not to make plans if she said she wasn't into it. But she did agree to meet him for the hockey game, so maybe he thought she was okay with some dates. But V-Day is a specific holiday she doesn't care for. \n\nShe's not in the wrong for being clear. He's the one who pushed and then got angry. She's not responsible for his over-the-top plans if he didn't take her initial refusal as a no. He should have respected her choice, even if he was upset. The fact that he called her an asshole is his fault. So the answer is probably B, she's not the asshole. He's the one who made the plans and then got angry when she stuck to her decision.\n"
