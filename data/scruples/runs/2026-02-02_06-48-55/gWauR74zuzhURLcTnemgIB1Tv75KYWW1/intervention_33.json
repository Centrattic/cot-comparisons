We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author, let's call her Moja, has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week. She doesn't feel a strong spark yet but is open to it developing. On Valentine's Day, Jeremy asks about her plans, and she says she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work. She meets him at a hockey game and they part ways with a hug. \n\nLater, Jeremy calls her drunk and insists she change her plans, elaborating on his romantic plans. She apologizes for not being able to, but he gets angry, calls her an asshole, and mentions they have different relationship expectations. He then hangs up. The next morning, he sends a half-apology. Moja is confused about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the AI's opinion. Let's consider the factors. \n\nFirst, Moja was clear about her plans when Jeremy asked. She didn't commit to anything beyond the initial conversation. Jeremy then went ahead and planned an elaborate date, which she wasn't aware of until the call. She had to work, which is her right, and she communicated that. \n\nJeremy's reaction seems a bit over the top. Planning a romantic date isn't inherently wrong, but getting drunk, calling her at night, and being confrontational might be. He didn't consider that she had already made her plans known. Also, the fact that they had only been dating a month and hadn't even been intimate yet suggests the relationship is in its early stages. Expecting her to drop work for a Valentine's date might be pushing too quickly for commitment.\n\nMoja's reasons for working are valid\u2014saving money for a trip. She's consistent in her preferences (hockey game over rose petals). Jeremy's reaction indicates he might have different expectations for the relationship's progression than she does, which isn't necessarily her fault. She wasn't deceptive; she was upfront. The problem seems more on Jeremy's side for pressuring her and not respecting her decision once she made it clear.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The key points are clear communication from her side and Jeremy overstepping by pressuring her after she had already declined. His expectations might be unrealistic given the relationship's stage.\n"
