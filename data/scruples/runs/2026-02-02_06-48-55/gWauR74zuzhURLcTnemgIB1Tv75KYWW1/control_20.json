We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a one-month relationship where the author, \"Moja,\" told her boyfriend Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out. Jeremy then made elaborate plans, including a dinner reservation, carriage ride, and bath with rose petals, and got upset when she didn't show up. She's now confused because he called her an asshole and hung up, and she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for a month. They see each other 2-3 times a week. She mentioned it's not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation, but she likes him and maybe there's potential for something more. She's clear about not caring about Valentine's Day and prefers working because it's good money. When he asked about her plans, she directly told him she'd work. Then later, when he calls drunk and upset, she reiterates her decision. He gets angry, says she's being a jerk, and she feels conflicted because maybe she should have considered his efforts.\n\nNow, the main question is whether Moja is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she was clear about her plans when he asked initially. She had work commitments, which she prioritized, and she communicated that upfront. It's her right to choose her time, especially if it's for a valid reason like work and saving money. Also, Jeremy's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since they've only been dating a month. Making elaborate plans based on a month-old relationship without knowing the other's preferences about holidays might be his mistake. Plus, he got drunk and called her an asshole, which is inappropriate behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in a relationship that you should make time for important dates. But the story says she wasn't into Valentine's Day to begin with and made that clear. She also mentioned her preferences gradually through their time together, so Jeremy might have been unaware. However, she didn't mention her Eurail trip earlier, which came up during the argument. Maybe that's a point where communication could have been better.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The key points are communication and expectations. Moja communicated her preference early on, so Jeremy might have misread the signals. His reaction seems excessive. Also, the fact that he made plans without knowing her stance on Valentine's Day could be his error. She's not obligated to go along with plans she didn't agree to, especially when she already set her priorities. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
