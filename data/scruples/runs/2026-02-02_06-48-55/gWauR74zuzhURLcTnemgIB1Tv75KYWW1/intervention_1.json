We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a one-month relationship where the author (Moja) told her date Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day instead of hanging out. Jeremy then got upset and made plans, which she found out later.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. Moja was clear from the start that she doesn't care about Valentine's Day and prefers to work for the money. Jeremy, on the other hand, took the time to plan something elaborate, which might have been a surprise. She might not have considered that he was trying to create a special moment, and he might have felt rejected. \n\nBut wait, she did tell him her plans directly when asked. That's important. If she was clear, then Jeremy should have known. However, he might have thought that after a month, there was enough connection to plan something. Moja's argument is that she's saving money for a trip and prefers her usual activities. She's also not into the holiday itself. \n\nNow, considering their relationship stage. They've been dating a month, seen each other a few times a week. It's not super long, but some might say planning a big date after a month is reasonable if they're seeing each other often. However, Moja didn't say no to future plans, just this specific day. \n\nThe argument could be that Jeremy overstepped by making big plans based on his own assumptions, while Moja was clear. On the flip side, maybe Jeremy was trying to show his feelings, and Moja didn't consider his efforts. \n\nAlso, he called her an asshole, which is unkind. Moja's response was about being clear and having her reasons. The key is whether being clear excuses Jeremy's planning. If she said no, then he shouldn't have planned, but maybe he thought she was teasing or wanted to be surprised. \n\nAnother angle: communication. If she didn't mention her Eurail trip, maybe that's a point. But the main issue is her right to choose to work. She's in a service job, so maybe the money is important. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She was clear, and he made assumptions. However, maybe she could have considered his feelings more. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since she was upfront, it's more on Jeremy for not respecting her initial decision. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
