We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a dating dilemma where the author, \"Moja,\" chose to work on Valentine's Day instead of meeting a guy named Jeremy, who had planned a romantic evening. There's a call where Jeremy, after drinking, gets upset and calls her an asshole. Now Moja is torn about whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points here. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for about a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. She's not feeling a strong spark yet, but they're not at the kissing stage. She told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work because it's good money. Later, he calls her after making elaborate plans and gets upset. She feels she was clear, but now there's guilt because he put effort into the plans.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong to stick to her plans. Let me break down the factors. Communication is key. Moja was clear about her preference to work and not celebrate Valentine's Day. That's direct. Jeremy, on the other hand, made plans without checking if she wanted to be with him, despite her indicating she's not into the holiday. He might have misread the signals or assumed she would change her mind. \n\nBut she had already stated her preference. The fact that he didn't take that into account and invested time and effort into a plan that she didn't express interest in might be on him. However, when he called her, he was drunk and confrontational, which complicates things. \n\nHer response was to reiterate her reasons, which were valid\u2014work for money and personal choice. She's saving for a trip, which is a legitimate reason. The argument here is whether it's wrong to prioritize work despite someone else's plans. \n\nIn many cases, people have different priorities. If Moja was clear and he still went ahead, maybe he should have respected her choice. But some might argue that after he made the effort, she should reconsider, even if it's not her preference. However, the initial communication was clear. She wasn't hiding her plans. \n\nJeremy's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't mean Moja was wrong. She's in a new relationship where there's no strong emotional commitment yet. It's her choice to prioritize work. The fact that he took it personally and reacted poorly is his issue. \n\nSo, the key points: clear communication from her, valid reasons for working, his misjudgment of the relationship stage by making big plans, his inappropriate reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
