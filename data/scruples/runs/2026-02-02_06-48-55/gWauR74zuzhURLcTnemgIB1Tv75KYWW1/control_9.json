We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for declining to spend Valentine's Day with Jeremy, a guy she's been dating for a month, even after he made a big romantic plan. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author and Jeremy have been dating a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. It's not a super passionate relationship yet, but there's potential. She told him upfront she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work because it pays well. Then, even when she's busy and not planning to see him, he calls her, maybe after drinking, and tries to get her to reconsider. She reiterates her plans, mentions her Eurail trip, and he gets angry and hangs up. Now she's confused if she was wrong because his plans were elaborate.\n\nSo, the key points are her clarity in communication and the timeline of the relationship. She was straightforward about her stance on Valentine's Day and her work schedule. Jeremy didn't seem to take her initial message seriously and proceeded to make plans without considering her preferences. The fact that he got upset and called her an asshole when she was clear might indicate he didn't handle the rejection well. \n\nShe also mentions that they haven't even been intimate yet, which might mean the relationship isn't super serious. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not changing her plans despite his efforts. Her reasons are about work and personal preference, which are valid. Jeremy's elaborate plans could be seen as overstepping if the relationship isn't at a stage where she expected them to do that. \n\nBut wait, he spent two weeks planning, which he might have thought was a big deal. However, if she had already communicated she wasn't interested in celebrating, maybe he should have respected that. The fact that she was saving money for a trip adds another layer of reason. \n\nI think the main issue is Jeremy's reaction. She was clear, and he should have known not to push. The user is asking if she's the asshole, but from the description, she's just sticking to what she said. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
