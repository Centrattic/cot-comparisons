We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo the author, let's call her Moja, has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super passionate relationship yet. On Sunday, Jeremy took her to a hockey game, which she loves. When leaving, he asked about her Valentine's plans, and she told him she prefers to work and doesn't care for the holiday. They're not at the kissing stage yet, so she hugged him and thought that was the end.\n\nBut later, Jeremy called her drunk and insisted she change her plans. He had planned a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and a rose petal bath. She explained she's working and not into the holiday. He called her an asshole and hung up. The next day he sent a half-apology. Now she's torn\u2014should she have been clearer that she didn't want to celebrate, or is Jeremy overstepping with the plans?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, she was clear about not wanting to celebrate Valentine's and preferring to work. She mentioned her job's good money on the day. Jeremy made plans after she was clear. So maybe he misunderstood or didn't respect her wishes. But once he made the plans, maybe he should have checked in again closer to the date instead of assuming she'd change her mind. Also, he called her an asshole, which is unkind.\n\nOn the other hand, he did put effort into the plans, which could show he's trying to be romantic. But she had already set her plans. Maybe she could have been more explicit or considered that he might have invested time and money, but she's not obligated to do what he wants. The key points are communication and mutual respect. She was clear, but maybe he should have respected that without pushing. Also, getting drunk and calling in a tirade isn't healthy. She's saving money for a trip, which is her priority. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she was clear and he didn't take her wishes into account, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if she knew he was planning something and didn't clarify further, maybe she's partially at fault. However, she did state her preference when he asked, so he should have taken that as a no. His reaction seems more problematic. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong. But need to check the nuances again.\n"
