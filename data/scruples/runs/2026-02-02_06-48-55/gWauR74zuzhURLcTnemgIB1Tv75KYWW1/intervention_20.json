We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they've been dating Jeremy for a month, seen each other a few times a week. They don't feel a strong spark yet but are considering the possibility of a deeper relationship. \n\nOn Sunday, Jeremy took them to a hockey game, which was nice. When walking them to the car, he asked about Valentine's Day plans. The author told him they don't care for the holiday and prefer to work because it's a good money day. They weren't even at the kissing point yet. Then, after a busy week, Jeremy calls late at night, already drunk, and tries to get them to change their mind. He reveals he made elaborate plans, which the author feels was premature given the relationship's stage. The author stood by their decision, explained they were clear, and mentioned their Eurail trip. Jeremy got angry, called them an asshole, and hung up. Now the author is conflicted about whether they were wrong to not go along with the plans.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, communication: The author did tell Jeremy upfront that they don't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work. That's clear. Jeremy, on the other hand, made big plans without confirming if the author's stance had changed. That's on him, right? He should have respected her initial statement. Plus, he approached her when she said she was too busy to see him that week. Calling late at night while drunk is probably not the best way to handle things. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship's stage. It's only been a month, and they haven't even kissed yet. Jeremy's plans might be a bit intense for how new the relationship is. The author has the right to set boundaries about their time and preferences. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they like Jeremy but don't feel a spark yet. Their priority is work and their trip, which is a valid personal choice. They didn't change their plans despite Jeremy's efforts, which he might have seen as a rejection, but he had prior notice. \n\nJeremy's reaction seems over the top. Getting drunk, calling late, and then lashing out after being told no\u2014this is his behavior that's problematic. The author is standing by their choice, which is their right. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author wasn't in the wrong. They communicated clearly, had valid reasons, and Jeremy overstepped by making plans without checking in again and reacting poorly. The author's actions were reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
