We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her AITA, has been dating Jeremy for about a month. They see each other a few times a week, but it's not a super intense, passionate relationship. AITA isn't into Valentine's Day and prefers to work because it pays well. She told Jeremy that upfront when he first asked about her plans.\n\nNow, Jeremy comes up with this elaborate plan\u2014dinner reservation, carriage ride, rose petal bath. AITA is clear she wants to work, but Jeremy still tries to get her to change her mind. She explains she's saving for a trip. He gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. The next day he sends a half-apology.\n\nSo, the question is whether AITA is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, communication. AITA did tell Jeremy her plans when he asked. She had already stated she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work. That seems clear. But maybe Jeremy thought there was a chance she might change her mind, especially if he put effort into planning. But AITA didn't know he had these plans. She said she was clear about working, so maybe she didn't realize the extent of what he was doing. Then again, he didn't mention the plans until later, so maybe it's not her responsibility to know.\n\nResponsibility for communication: In relationships, both people need to communicate their needs. Jeremy might have assumed that maybe she would be interested in the plans, but if she was clear she wanted to work, then he should have considered that. On the flip side, maybe he expected her to be more flexible or to appreciate the romantic gesture, but she's not into that. Her preferences are valid too.\n\nBoundaries: She's in a relationship where she's not sure about the spark yet, but she's not lying about her preferences. She's being honest about her plans. So, maybe she's not wrong for sticking to her plans. But perhaps she could have been more considerate of his feelings, but he did overreact. He made a big plan and then got angry when she didn't change her mind, even after she was clear. That's on him, right?\n\nEmotional reactivity: Jeremy's reaction seems excessive. He got drunk, called her an asshole, which is not okay. He should have respected her initial decision. So, maybe the problem is more on his side. But the user is asking if AITA is wrong. She did say she prefers to work, which is her choice. She didn't know about his plans yet, so she couldn't have considered them. Once he told her, she explained her reasons again, but he didn't back down. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. She's being honest and sticking to her decision. The issue is Jeremy's overreaction and lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've only been dating a month and she's not sure about the spark. It's possible that she's not invested enough to make the effort for his plans. That's her prerogative. People have different priorities. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She communicated her plans, and he overstepped by pressuring her and reacting poorly.\n"
