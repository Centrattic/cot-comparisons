We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, let's call her Moja, who's been dating Jeremy for about a month. She told him she prefers working on Valentine's Day instead of spending time with him, even after he had planned a romantic evening. They aren't that far in the relationship yet\u2014they haven't even kissed, as far as I can tell from the description.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. Moja said she was clear that she didn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work. She even gave her reasoning about saving money for a trip. Jeremy, on the other hand, made elaborate plans, perhaps expecting her to be excited or at least consider them. But he didn't confirm with her again after she already stated her preference. That's a red flag. If he had good communication, he might have checked in again before making those plans.\n\nBut then, after she declined, he got angry and called her an asshole. That's unprofessional and inconsiderate. His reaction seems to be more about his own expectations not being met rather than respecting her decision. He should have been understanding, especially since they're not in a committed stage where such expectations are set. The fact that they've only been dating a month and haven't even kissed yet suggests that maybe he had higher expectations too quickly, which is on him.\n\nMoja's point is that she was clear and that she's not into the holiday. She also mentioned that she's saving money for her trip, which is a legitimate reason. The fact that he didn't take her initial refusal as a final answer and instead proceeded with plans shows poor communication from his side. The author felt torn because she thought maybe she should give him a chance, but the initial clarity of her message seems to absolve her of blame. The problem here is more on Jeremy's side for not respecting her boundaries and overreacting. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
