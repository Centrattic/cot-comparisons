We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans.\n\nSo the author, Moja, is dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week. The author mentions that there's no big spark, but they're okay with each other. On Sunday, Jeremy takes her to a hockey game, which she loves. Then he asks about her Valentine's Day plans, and she tells him upfront she doesn't care about the holiday and would rather work because it's good money. They aren't even at the kissing stage yet, so she thinks that's the end of it.\n\nBut Jeremy calls her later, drunk, and gets upset. He had planned a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and rose petal bath. The author clarifies she's not into Valentine's Day and prefers other activities. Jeremy gets angry, says she's being an asshole, and ends the call. The next day, he texts a non-apology/apology, making her feel bad. She's now torn about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if Moja was wrong. She was clear with Jeremy about her plans when he asked. She didn't hide her feelings about not celebrating V-Day. Jeremy made elaborate plans after she already told him she wasn't interested. That seems like his issue. He might have been hoping for a different answer. But she was honest and gave the reasons. \n\nHowever, after Jeremy called, she felt bad and considered giving him a chance. But he made the plans despite her prior communication. The key points here are communication and expectations. She was clear, and he didn't take her answer as a final no. Maybe he thought she was just testing him or wanted to see his effort. But she was direct, so he should have respected that. \n\nAlso, Jeremy's reaction of calling her an asshole and getting drunk to make the call is pretty immature. His behavior escalated things unnecessarily. The author isn't wrong for sticking to her decision, especially since she communicated it clearly. She's also saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe she could have considered Jeremy's feelings more, but she already did tell him upfront. The problem arises from Jeremy not respecting her wishes. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author's actions were honest and consistent with her values, and Jeremy overstepped by not respecting her decision.\n"
