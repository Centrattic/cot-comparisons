We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Moja (the author) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's been dating Jeremy for a month, and she told him she'd rather work on Valentine's Day instead of spending time with him, even after he had planned a romantic evening.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja met Jeremy on Tinder, they've been seeing each other a few times a week for a month. She says it's not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but she likes him and maybe there's potential for more. She's not feeling a strong spark yet. \n\nOn Sunday, Jeremy took her to a hockey game (her favorite sport), and when walking her to her car, he asked about her Valentine's plans. She directly told him she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work for the money. They aren't at the point of kissing yet, so she hugged him and thought that was the end.\n\nThen, the next part is where things get complicated. She was busy and didn't plan to see him, but he called her drunk at 8pm, asking if she reconsidered. She said she was sorry but already scheduled to work. He told her he had arranged a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and rose petal bath. She responded that she was clear, and she's more into hockey and hot wings. He got angry, called her an asshole, and hung up. Then he sent a half-apology text.\n\nNow, Moja is confused. She's torn between feeling bad for him and thinking she's not at fault because she was clear with her plans. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nTo determine if she's in the wrong, I should consider a few things. First, communication. She did tell him upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work. So she was clear. But maybe she didn't consider his feelings? But he's the one who made elaborate plans, which might not have been appropriate for a relationship that's only been going on a month. Also, he had not been intimate yet, so maybe expecting her to be into a romantic dinner on V-Day is a bit much.\n\nAnother angle: Jeremy's reaction. He called her an asshole and got angry. That's his fault. But maybe his overreaction was because he put in a lot of effort. However, he had the chance to back out if he thought she wasn't into it. Also, he called her drunk and pressured her to change her plans. \n\nMoja didn't know he had all these plans when she initially said she wanted to work. So she wasn't avoiding his feelings; she was honest. Then, after he explained, she tried to explain her reasons again. She's saving money for her trip, which is a valid reason. \n\nIs there any fault on her part? Maybe she could have considered that he might have feelings, but she was clear from the start. He chose to plan a big date without ensuring she was into that kind of thing. So the problem is his for not checking if she wanted that. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong). She communicated her preferences, and he overstepped by planning a romantic evening for a still-early relationship. His reaction was inappropriate, and she's not at fault for sticking to her decision after being clear.\n"
