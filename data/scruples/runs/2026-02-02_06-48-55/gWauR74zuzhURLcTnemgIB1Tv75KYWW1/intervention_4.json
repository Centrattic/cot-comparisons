We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a dating relationship with Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super passionate relationship. The author isn't feeling a big spark but is still interested in maybe something more in the future. On Sunday, Jeremy took her to a hockey game, which she likes. When walking her back to her car, he asked about her Valentine's Day plans. She told him directly she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work. They aren't at the kissing stage yet, just hugged.\n\nLater, Jeremy called her at 8pm while drunk. He asked if she'd reconsider, but she was already scheduled to work. Then he mentioned he'd spent two weeks planning an elaborate date: a nice restaurant (which he implies is the best, but she works at a Michelin-star one), a carriage ride, and a rose petal bath. She says she was clear she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's and that she's more into hockey and hot wings. Jeremy called her an asshole, saying the relationship has two parts and he likes the romantic stuff. She clarified she's not opposed to those things but needs to work for her Eurail trip, which upsets him and he hangs up. The next day, he sends a non-apology apology, making her feel bad. She's torn: maybe she should have given him a chance since he put effort in, but she was clear about her plans.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's look at communication. The author told Jeremy directly that she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's and preferred working. That seems clear. But maybe she could have been more considerate? Jeremy then tried to plan a big date, which he put effort into, and when she refused, he got angry. The author might not be wrong because she communicated her preference, and it's her right to choose how to spend her time. However, maybe she should have considered Jeremy's feelings more, given that he worked hard on the plans. \n\nBut Jeremy's reaction was problematic. Getting drunk and then calling her after she already said she's working, leading to a tirade and hanging up. That's not respectful. The author was clear, and Jeremy should have respected that. The fact that he was upset because she didn't use his plans could be his issue, not hers. She might be justified in sticking to her decision. Also, the author mentions they aren't intimate yet, so maybe the romantic elements weren't expected. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have softened her response or discussed the plans before committing to work. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was clear and had a valid reason (saving money for a trip), it's not her fault. Jeremy's overreaction and disrespect are his problems. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
