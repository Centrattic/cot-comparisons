We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super intense, sparks flying relationship. The author isn't really into Valentine's Day and told Jeremy they'd rather work on Valentine's Day because it's lucrative. Then Jeremy, after getting drunk, calls and tells her he had this elaborate plan for dinner, carriage ride, rose petal bath, etc. The author stands by her decision to work, and Jeremy gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. First, communication. The author was clear from the start that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work. Then when Jeremy calls, she's already scheduled to work, so she can't change her plans. Jeremy's reaction seems a bit over the top. He made plans based on maybe an assumption that she wanted to celebrate. But the author had already told him her preferences. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's being honest about her priorities. She's saving money for a trip, and her job is important. She's not into the holiday. Jeremy might have expected her to be more into the romantic stuff, but the author has stated her position. The fact that Jeremy got angry and accused her of being an asshole seems more like his overreaction than her wrongdoing. \n\nBut maybe some people would say that even if she said she doesn't like Valentine's, he had the right to express his feelings and want to do something special. However, the author was clear, and if Jeremy wanted to plan something, maybe he should have checked in again. But once she told him she's working, he's being unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the relationship is a month old, which is not super long. So maybe the author isn't obligated to spend Valentine's Day with him. If Jeremy made plans after she already said she's working, that's his issue. The author isn't the one changing plans. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her plans clearly, and Jeremy's reaction was his own issue. The answer should be B.\n"
