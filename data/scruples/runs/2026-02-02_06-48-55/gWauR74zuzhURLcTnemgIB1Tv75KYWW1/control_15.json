We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans and a disagreement with their partner, Jeremy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The OP met Jeremy a month ago, they've seen each other 2-3 times a week. They're not in a super intense relationship yet, but there's potential. On Sunday, Jeremy asked about Valentine's plans, and the OP told him directly they don't care about the holiday and would rather work. Then, a week later, Jeremy calls her, drunk, and starts a tirade about his elaborate plans: dinner at a nice restaurant, carriage ride, rose petals. The OP clarifies she didn't want to celebrate and had already committed to work. Jeremy gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. The next day he sends a half-apology. The OP is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? Let's break it down. The OP was clear about her preferences when Jeremy first asked. She told him she doesn't care for Valentine's and prefers to work. That's straightforward communication. Then, later, he goes ahead and makes these plans without considering her initial refusal. Even though the relationship is a month old, if she was clear, he should have respected that. The fact that he spent time and effort on plans she already told him she wasn't interested in suggests he might have misread the signals or continued planning anyway. \n\nThe argument here is about communication and respect. The OP expressed her disinterest in Valentine's Day plans. Jeremy, instead of accepting that, tried to push, even after she reiterated her reasons. His reaction\u2014calling her an asshole and getting angry\u2014seems more about him feeling disrespected or rejected. But the OP's stance is that she was clear, so it's not her fault he made these plans. \n\nAlso, the OP mentioned she likes Jeremy but there's no big spark yet. She's in a casual dating phase. Maybe they haven't established a clear level of commitment where Valentine's Day planning is expected. The fact that they haven't even kissed yet suggests the relationship isn't at a point where elaborate gestures are necessary. \n\nJeremy's reaction might indicate that he has different expectations for the relationship's progression. He might be assuming they're in a more committed stage, while the OP is still in a more casual, exploratory phase. That could be a mismatch in expectations. The OP isn't wrong for sticking to her preferences once she communicated them. If anything, she's being honest about her priorities. \n\nHowever, some might argue that maybe the OP could have been more considerate of Jeremy's feelings, but given that she was clear and he proceeded regardless, the fault lies more on Jeremy for not respecting her boundaries. The OP isn't obligated to change her plans just because someone else wants to celebrate a holiday. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the OP isn't in the wrong. She communicated her stance, and Jeremy failed to respect that, leading to the conflict. The answer would be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
