We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nSo, the author is dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week. She doesn't feel a big spark yet but likes him and is considering it could develop into something more. Then, Jeremy asks about her Valentine's Day plans, and she directly tells him she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work because she needs the money for a Eurail trip. Later, even after she's clear, he calls her drunk and makes a big deal about his elaborate plans. She ends up feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, she was upfront. When he asked about V-Day plans, she said she'd rather work. That's clear communication. Then he proceeded to make all these plans, which she didn't know about until he told her. So, he went ahead and spent time and effort on something she had already declined. \n\nHe's upset because she didn't change her mind, even after she explained her reasons. She's saving money, which is a legitimate reason. Also, she's clear about not being into the holiday and prefers simpler things like hockey games and hot wings. \n\nHe gets drunk, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. That's pretty disrespectful. She didn't owe him changing her plans after she made them clear. The fact that he made the plans anyway and then got angry seems to be his issue. \n\nThe user might think she should have been more understanding, but the key here is communication. She was clear, and he didn't respect her boundary. Also, his reaction was inappropriate. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
