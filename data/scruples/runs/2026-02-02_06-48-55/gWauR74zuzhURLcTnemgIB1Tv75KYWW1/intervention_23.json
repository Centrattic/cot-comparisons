We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong in the given situation. The situation involves a dating issue around Valentine's Day.\n\nSo, the author is dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week. The author isn't feeling a strong spark yet but likes him and maybe there's potential for more. On Valentine's Day, the author had a hockey game date and then told Jeremy directly that they don't care for Valentine's Day and prefer to work because it's good money. They didn't think more of it since they haven't gotten to the point where they kiss goodbye yet.\n\nLater, Jeremy calls drunk, asking if she reconsidered. The author says they already have work scheduled. Jeremy then goes on a tirade about elaborate plans he made: dinner at a nice restaurant, carriage ride, rose petal bath. The author explains they're saving money for a trip and that they had already declined. Jeremy gets angry, calls the author an asshole, and the author feels conflicted because maybe she should be more understanding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. \n\nFirst, looking at communication. The author was clear when Jeremy asked about plans. They said they don't care for the holiday and would rather work. That's clear communication. Then after Jeremy made the plans, the author didn't change her mind. Jeremy might have assumed she would change her mind because he put effort in, but the author had already communicated her preference. \n\nJeremy's response: making plans without checking again if she was still interested. Maybe he thought he could win her over with the effort. But the author had already said no. Then he gets confrontational, drunk, and calls her an asshole. That's on him. \n\nThe author's intentions were to be clear and not lead him on. Jeremy's overreaction is his responsibility. The author isn't obligated to conform to his romantic expectations, especially if she's not into Valentine's Day. She had a valid reason (work and saving money). \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're not even at the point of intimacy yet. So, Jeremy's plans might be too intense for where they are in the relationship. The author isn't wrong for not going along with that. \n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong, but I don't see that. The author was clear, had reasons, and Jeremy overstepped. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
