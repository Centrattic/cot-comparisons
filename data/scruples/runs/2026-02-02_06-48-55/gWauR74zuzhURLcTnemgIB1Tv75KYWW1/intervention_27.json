We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a one-month dating relationship where the author, Moja, told Jeremy she preferred to work on Valentine's Day instead of participating in his romantic plans. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for a month, meeting a few times a week. She doesn't feel a strong spark yet but likes him. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she was direct: she doesn't care for the holiday and wants to work. Later, Jeremy calls her, drunk, explaining his elaborate plans (dinner, carriage ride, bath) and gets upset when she sticks to her decision. Moja clarifies she's saving money for a trip, causing Jeremy to hang up. He texts a non-apology later, making her feel bad but conflicted.\n\nThe user thinks Moja is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On Moja's side: she was clear about her preference before he made the plans. She had already stated she didn't care for Valentine's Day and would work. Jeremy's plans were elaborate and perhaps premature for a one-month relationship. She's honest about her needs and her reasons. She's also setting boundaries by prioritizing work and personal goals.\n\nOn Jeremy's side: He put effort into planning a romantic evening, which is a common gesture. He was hurt and expressed it, albeit poorly (drunk call, tirade). His reaction might stem from feeling rejected or not respected. However, Moja had already communicated her stance. His approach was inappropriate, especially hanging up and the aggressive tone.\n\nThe key here is whether Moja was wrong in being clear and not changing her plans. Since she was upfront and the relationship isn't at a stage where his plans are expected, she's within her rights to prioritize work. Jeremy's reaction was over the top and disrespectful, especially the drunk call and harsh words. Moja isn't obligated to participate in a holiday she doesn't care for, especially when work is important to her. Her honesty is a positive trait. Jeremy's issue is more about not respecting her boundaries once she set them. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
