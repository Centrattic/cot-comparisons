We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy named Jeremy who planned a romantic date for Valentine's Day, but the author, Moja, had already told him she didn't care for the holiday and preferred to work. Despite that, Jeremy went ahead with the plans, and when Moja confirmed her plans again, he got upset and ended up in an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would be working. She met him for a hockey game, which he paid for, and then later he called her after drinking, upset that she didn't reciprocate his romantic efforts. She explained her reasons again, including her plans to save for a trip. He got angry, called her an asshole, and hung up. Now she's questioning if she's the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and expectations. Moja was clear about her stance on Valentine's Day and her priorities. Jeremy, however, may have misread her initial interactions as a sign that she was okay with a romantic gesture, even if she didn't express interest in the holiday itself. But she had already stated her preference multiple times. The problem is Jeremy's reaction, which was out of proportion. He made plans based on his own assumptions despite her clear communication. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, when someone expresses their preference clearly, it's the other person's responsibility to respect that. Jeremy's elaborate plans show he didn't take her words seriously, perhaps projecting his own desires onto her. Moja isn't obligated to change her plans just because he wanted to make it a special day. His anger and accusation that she was acting like an asshole come from his own mismanagement of expectations, not her lack of effort.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that they're not in a committed relationship where such gestures are expected adds another layer. In a casual or early-stage relationship, expecting a romantic holiday plan might be a bit much, especially when the person involved has already stated they're not into it. Moja's honesty about her priorities is reasonable. She's also saving money for a personal goal, which is a valid reason.\n\nJeremy's reaction, including the drunken call and the ultimatum about the relationship having two parts, seems more about his own disappointment and potential overinvestment rather than her fault. She had no obligation to change her plans once she communicated them clearly. The burden here is on Jeremy to read the signals and respect her boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that Moja isn't in the wrong. She communicated her stance, and Jeremy's actions and reactions are a result of not respecting her initial communication. The answer should be B (No).\n"
