We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong in their situation with Jeremy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been dating Jeremy for about a month, meeting 2-3 times a week. They don't feel a strong spark yet but are open to the relationship developing. When Jeremy asked about Valentine's Day plans, the author clearly communicated they prefer to work, not celebrate. Later, Jeremy got drunk and called, revealing his elaborate plans, which the author felt was excessive given the relationship's stage. The argument escalated, with Jeremy calling the author an asshole and hanging up. Now, the author is conflicted about whether they're the bad guy.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, expectations, and boundaries. The author was upfront about not wanting to celebrate V-Day and being busy. Jeremy, however, proceeded to create these plans without checking if the author was okay with them. The author's main issue is that Jeremy didn't respect their clear communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and preferences. The author made their stance clear, and Jeremy's actions seem to have ignored that, especially with the drunk call and the tirade. The author isn't obligated to change their plans just because Jeremy wanted a romantic gesture. Jeremy's reaction was inappropriate, especially the drunk call and the accusation of being an asshole. \n\nThe author's decision to work is their own choice, and they have the right to prioritize their goals (like saving for a trip). Jeremy's plans might have been well-intentioned, but timing and respecting the current relationship stage matter. The author isn't wrong for standing by their decision, especially since they were clear from the start. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Jeremy didn't respect their boundaries and acted out inappropriately. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
