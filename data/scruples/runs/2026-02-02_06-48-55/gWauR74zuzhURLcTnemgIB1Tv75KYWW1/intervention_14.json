We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans and communication between Jeremy and the author.\n\nFirst, the author had already told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work for the money. So she was clear from the start. Jeremy then planned an elaborate date over two weeks, which the author didn't know about. When he asked about her plans, she reiterated that she'd work. But Jeremy was disappointed, maybe because he put a lot of effort into the plans. \n\nNow, the author is wondering if she's the asshole (AITA) because she didn't back down and Jeremy got upset. The key points here are communication and expectations. She communicated her preference early on, so Jeremy should have known not to plan a romantic date with her. However, maybe Jeremy hoped that after his efforts, she might change her mind, which she didn't. \n\nThe author gives reasons: she likes Jeremy but there's no spark, she's saving for a trip, and she's clear about her plans. Jeremy's reaction was to call her an asshole and hang up, which is not great. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. \n\nOn one hand, the author made her stance clear, so she's not obligated to change her plans. On the other, maybe Jeremy felt hurt because he put effort into something romantic. But since they've only been dating a month and the author hasn't been into the holiday, Jeremy should have considered that. His reaction of yelling and hanging up is inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She was clear, and it's Jeremy's responsibility to accept her preferences. The author isn't required to participate in activities she's not interested in. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
