We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (Moja) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main issue is that Moja told Jeremy she preferred to work on Valentine's Day instead of going on his elaborate date, even after finding out he had planned a romantic evening.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja had been dating Jeremy for about a month, seeing each other 2-3 times a week. The relationship isn't super intense but is going okay. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she was direct: she doesn't care about the holiday and prefers working for the money. Then, later, Jeremy calls her drunk and tells her he made a big plan, which she hadn't known about. She explains she already had work, and he gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider both sides. Moja was clear about not wanting to celebrate Valentine's Day. She had already mentioned she preferred working, so maybe Jeremy should have taken that hint. However, he put in effort for a romantic plan, which might have been hurtful for her to dismiss, especially if he invested time and resources. But he called her an asshole and got drunk, which seems like his mistake.\n\nThe question is whether Moja is in the wrong. If she was clear and he should have respected that, then she's not wrong. But if she should have considered his feelings and maybe made an exception, then she might be. But the key here is that she was clear from the start. If he didn't take her initial response seriously and still went ahead with the plans, he's at fault. Also, he reacted poorly when she didn't change her mind, which is not her responsibility. She had a valid reason (saving for a trip) and she was honest. So I think she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
