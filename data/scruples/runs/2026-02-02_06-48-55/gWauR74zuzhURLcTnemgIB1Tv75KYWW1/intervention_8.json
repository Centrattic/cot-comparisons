We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (Moja) turning down a Valentine's Day plan that her date, Jeremy, had arranged, even after he told her about his elaborate plans. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. Moja had been dating Jeremy for about a month. She's been seeing him 2-3 times a week but admits it's not a \"fireworks\" situation, though she's considering it could develop into something more. She's clear that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work on that day. She told Jeremy this directly when he asked about her plans. However, later, Jeremy calls her, explains his plans (dinner at a nice restaurant, carriage ride, rose petal bath), and Moja reiterates her decision to work. Jeremy gets upset and they argue. Now, Moja is unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. Moja was upfront about her dislike of Valentine's Day and her preference to work when Jeremy first asked. He then went ahead and made these plans, which she didn't know about until the call. She argues that she was clear, and Jeremy should have respected her initial decision. However, some might say that maybe Jeremy thought they were closer, and she didn't consider his feelings when he had already put effort into planning. \n\nBut wait, the timeline is important. When he asked about her plans, she said she's working and doesn't care for the holiday. If she had told him about the Eurail trip at that point, maybe he would have adjusted. But she didn't, so he proceeded with his plans. She was clear, and Jeremy made the plans without checking again. So, maybe she's not in the wrong for sticking to her original answer. \n\nHowever, when he called after making the plans, she could have shown more empathy, even if she still declined. But she did say she was saving for the trip, which is a valid reason. The argument Jeremy had about the relationship having two parts and that she was being an asshole is on him, as he should have respected her initial decision. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Moja was clear, and Jeremy should have considered that before making the plans. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
