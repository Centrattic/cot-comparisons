We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves Valentine's Day plans and a potential conflict with Jeremy.\n\nFirst, the main points: The author told Jeremy upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work, which is a source of good money. Jeremy later planned a romantic evening, which she didn't know about until he called her drunk. She then had to decline again, and he got angry, leading to a breakup-like situation.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author was clear about her preference not to celebrate V-Day. Jeremy made plans assuming she might change her mind, even though she had already stated her position. The key here is whether the author was obligated to go along with his plans after stating her initial preference. \n\nShe mentioned that she's not into the holiday and that she's saving money for a trip. Jeremy's reaction seems to be about his investment in the plans, which he might feel disrespected by her not accepting them. However, she had already communicated her stance, so maybe Jeremy should have respected that instead of making elaborate plans. \n\nThe author is torn between feeling bad for Jeremy's effort and her own needs. But the fact that she was clear and he didn't take her word into account might mean that she's not in the wrong. Also, Jeremy's response of calling her an asshole and hanging up is a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author communicated her preference, but Jeremy acted as if she could be convinced otherwise. So, the author isn't wrong for sticking to her decision. The answer would be B (Not the asshole).\n"
