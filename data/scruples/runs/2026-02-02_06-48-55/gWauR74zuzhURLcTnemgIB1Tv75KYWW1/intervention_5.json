We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dating issue involving Valentine's Day.\n\nSo, the author (let's call her Moja) has been dating Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week. She doesn't feel a spark yet but likes him. On Sunday, he took her to a hockey game, and when dropping her off, he asked about her Valentine's Day plans. She told him she doesn't care for the holiday and would rather work. She's clear about it. \n\nLater, he calls her drunk, insists on changing her plans, and gets upset when she doesn't. He made elaborate plans, which she wasn't aware of at first. He accuses her of acting like an asshole. She feels bad, but also thinks he shouldn't have planned so much for a new relationship. She's torn between feeling guilty and thinking he overstepped.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, communication. Moja was clear when he first asked about her plans. She told him she doesn't like Valentine's Day and would rather work. So she was upfront. Jeremy, on the other hand, made plans without checking if she was on board. Even if he had good intentions, it's possible he misread the signals or didn't take her initial refusal seriously. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If someone says they don't want to celebrate a holiday, it's on the other person not to push or plan something they're not interested in. Moja communicated her stance, so she's not in the wrong for sticking to it. \n\nJeremy's reaction is problematic. Getting drunk, calling late at night, and having a tirade isn't healthy behavior. He shouldn't have taken it out on her. She was clear, and he should have respected that. Also, the fact that he didn't even know about her Eurail trip suggests he might not have been fully informed about her priorities. \n\nHowever, could there be a misunderstanding? Maybe she was too direct, but she had the right to express her preferences. The key here is that she was honest from the start, and he didn't adjust his plans accordingly. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Moja wasn't wrong to say she would rather work. She communicated clearly, and Jeremy's actions were over the line. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
