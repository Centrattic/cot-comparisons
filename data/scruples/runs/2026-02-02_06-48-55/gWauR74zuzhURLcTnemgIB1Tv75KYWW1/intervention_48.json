We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The author, let's call her Moja, had been dating Jeremy for a month. She told him she'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after he told her about his elaborate plans.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They've been dating for a month, met a few times a week. It's not a fiery romance but a \"maybe something more\" scenario. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she was direct: she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work for the money. They weren't even at the kissing point yet. Then, later, he calls her when he's drunk, asks her to reconsider, and she refuses again. He gets upset, says she's acting like an asshole, and then he hangs up. The next day, he sends a half-apology, but she's conflicted.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether she was wrong to stick with her original decision. She was clear from the start that she didn't want to celebrate Valentine's and preferred working. He put in a lot of effort after their first date, but she didn't tell him about her Eurail trip. She's worried maybe she should have given him a chance, but she feels it's his fault for making plans too soon.\n\nHmm. In relationships, communication is key. She was upfront about not wanting to celebrate Valentine's. If he didn't get the message, maybe he's the one who didn't listen. But then again, maybe she should have considered his feelings. But she had specific reasons: work for money and her personal preferences. He might have overstepped by making such elaborate plans based on her initial casual mention. Also, drunk calls can be problematic, and his reaction seems a bit over the top. She's not obligated to change her plans just because he made plans. However, maybe she could have been more empathetic, but she did explain her reasons. \n\nI think the key points are that she was clear, he didn't take the hint, and his response was inappropriate. She's not in the wrong for sticking to her decision. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
