We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is dating someone named Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week. It's not a super intense relationship yet, more like casual with potential. The key point here is that the author told Jeremy she doesn't care about Valentine's Day and would rather work because it's good money. Then, Jeremy comes up with a romantic plan, which she wasn't expecting. When she refuses again, he gets upset and calls her an asshole, then hangs up. Now she's feeling conflicted about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author made her plans clear early on. She told Jeremy she wasn't into Valentine's Day and preferred to work. That's communication, which is important. But then Jeremy, despite knowing her stance, went ahead and made elaborate plans. Maybe he thought she was being polite and wanted to surprise her? But the author wasn't expecting that and was clear about her preference. \n\nWhen Jeremy called her after being drunk and confrontational, that's a red flag. He made plans without checking if she was okay with them, even after she said she wasn't interested in the holiday. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable. She's upfront about her intentions, and Jeremy's reaction is more about his own expectations not being met. \n\nThe author mentions they're not even at the kissing stage yet, so the relationship is still in the early stages. Maybe Jeremy misread the level of commitment or assumed too much. The key here is that the author communicated her schedule and preferences, and Jeremy didn't respect that by making plans she had no interest in. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeremy might have thought that since they were dating, she would be open to a romantic gesture. But the author hasn't shown any signs of being into that. She even mentions she's more of a \"hockey and hot wings\" person. So, Jeremy might have overstepped by making such a big plan without confirming with her again. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I don't see it. The author was clear, Jeremy didn't respect her boundaries by making the plans, and then reacted poorly when she said no. The author isn't to blame here. The problem is on Jeremy's side for not respecting her initial communication and overcompensating with a plan that she wasn't interested in. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
