We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a person, let's call her Moja, who's been dating Jeremy for a month. She told him she doesn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day and prefers to work, even after he told her he had a romantic plan. Then Jeremy got upset and called her an asshole. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja is clear about her preferences: she doesn't care for Valentine's Day, prefers working for the money, and mentioned her preference when Jeremy asked. She's been with him a month, which isn't super long. Jeremy, on the other hand, spent time and effort planning a romantic evening, which Moja later finds out about. He gets drunk and confronts her, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did Moja do something wrong by not changing her plans, even after Jeremy's elaborate efforts? Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom Moja's perspective, she communicated her plans upfront. She's saving money for a trip, and she's not into the holiday. She might feel that Jeremy should respect her boundaries and preferences. Relationships are about mutual respect, so if she clearly stated her intentions, he should accept it. However, he might have thought that maybe she would reconsider, especially since he put in the effort. \n\nOn the other hand, Jeremy's reaction was to get drunk and rant, which is not healthy. The fact that he didn't tell her about his plans until after she already declined might be a problem. If he had asked earlier, maybe she could have considered. But she did tell him her plans directly when he asked, so he might have been ignoring her communication. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that Moja is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's justified. The key factors are: clear communication, mutual respect, and effort. Moja was upfront, and Jeremy's response was inappropriate. The problem might be that he didn't respect her decision once she made it, and he made a big deal about it after she had already said no. \n\nAlso, in a one-month relationship, it's still early. People have different expectations, and Moja might not want to celebrate V-Day. She's not obligated to change her plans just because he wanted to. So, I think she's not in the wrong here. The issue is more on Jeremy's side for not respecting her choice and reacting poorly. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
