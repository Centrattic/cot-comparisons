We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Valentine's Day plans. The user, Moja, has been dating Jeremy for a month. She told him upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and would rather work because it's good money. But then Jeremy goes ahead and plans an elaborate romantic dinner, carriage ride, etc. She ends up working and they get into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. Moja was clear that she doesn't like Valentine's Day and prefers to work. That's important because she set her boundaries early. Jeremy, on the other hand, didn't take that into account and still made plans. So maybe he's the one who didn't listen or respect her wishes.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's nuance. The user says that they aren't even to the \"kiss goodbye\" stage yet. So the relationship is relatively new. Jeremy planned something big, maybe trying to impress her. But if she already said she's not into it, he should have respected that. \n\nThen there's the part where Jeremy called her an asshole. That's pretty harsh. He made plans without considering her previous statements and then got upset when she didn't change her mind. His reaction might be more at fault here. \n\nMoja's reasoning is that she wanted to work for money for her trip and she's more into casual activities like hockey games. She was clear, so she's not wrong for sticking to her decision. Jeremy's overreaction and not heeding her initial refusal could be his fault. \n\nThe key points are: clear communication from Moja, Jeremy's failure to respect her wishes, and his poor reaction. So in this case, Moja isn't in the wrong. She communicated her stance, and Jeremy's actions led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
