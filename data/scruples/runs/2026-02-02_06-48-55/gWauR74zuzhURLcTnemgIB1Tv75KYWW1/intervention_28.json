We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super passionate relationship yet. The author mentioned that they don't really care about Valentine's Day and prefer to work because it's good money. Jeremy then, after getting drunk, called to ask if she'd reconsider and ended up being upset when she didn't. He accused her of acting like an asshole and hung up. Now she's unsure if she's the asshole because he worked hard on the plans, but she was clear about her preference to work.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points. When Jeremy asked about her Valentine's plans, she was direct and clear that she'd rather work and isn't into the holiday. That seems straightforward. He then took two weeks to plan something elaborate, which might have been based on her initial response. But she was already scheduled to work and had communicated that. \n\nWait, the problem here is that he made these plans expecting her to change her mind after she had already declined. She had no obligation to go through with it because she was clear from the start. Plus, the fact that he called when he was drunk and got angry might be a red flag. She was consistent in her decision, and he overreacted. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he thought there was a chance she might change her mind, especially if the relationship is progressing. But the author was clear about her stance. She also mentioned that the relationship isn't at a kissing stage yet, so maybe the expectations weren't aligned. He might have thought they were more serious. However, she had made it clear that she's not into the romantic holiday stuff. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. The user's reasoning might be that Jeremy was hurt and put effort in, so maybe the author should have been more considerate. But I think the author was clear, and Jeremy's reaction was more inappropriate. She's not obligated to change her plans based on his efforts, especially if she was upfront. Also, his tirade and hanging up after being drunk is uncool. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She communicated her preference, and Jeremy overreacted. The effort he put in might not be the author's responsibility if she had already said no. The problem is his reaction, not her being clear about her choice. Plus, she's saving money for a trip, which is a valid reason to work. The key is that she was upfront, and he should have respected that or not invested so much time in a plan she had already rejected.\n"
