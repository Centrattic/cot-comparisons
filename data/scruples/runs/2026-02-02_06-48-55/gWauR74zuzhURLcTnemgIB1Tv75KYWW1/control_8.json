We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dating question where the author, let's call her Moja, told her boyfriend Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day instead of hanging out, even after he made a big romantic plan.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. Moja met Jeremy a month ago through Tinder. They've been seeing each other 2-3 times a week. It's not a super intense relationship; she mentions there's no \"fireworks at first sight\" but she's getting to like him more. She's not sure if there's a spark yet but is open to it developing. \n\nOn Sunday, they went to a hockey game, and he asked her about Valentine's Day plans. She directly told him she doesn't care for the holiday and prefers to work because it's good money. They weren't even at the kissing stage, just a hug. Then later, Jeremy calls her drunk, tries to get her to reconsider. He had planned a fancy dinner, carriage ride, and a rose petal bath. She explains she was clear, and she likes practical stuff like hockey and hot wings. He gets upset, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. The next day he sends a half-apology. Moja is torn\u2014maybe she should give him a chance for the effort, but she was clear before he made the plans.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. She told him upfront that she doesn't care for Valentine's Day and prefers to work. So she was clear. However, he made big plans not knowing she was set on working. But she did tell him her preference. Is she responsible for his actions after she communicated that? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If you express your preferences clearly, you can't be blamed for the other person's reaction if they choose to ignore or not fully consider it. Jeremy made plans after she said she'd rather work. Maybe he hoped she'd change her mind, but she was clear. So maybe it's on him for not respecting her initial answer once he had it. \n\nAlso, the fact that he got drunk and called her an asshole is his own behavior. She's not responsible for his overreaction. The argument could be that she didn't give enough indication, but she had been clear and even gave the example of preferring hockey over romantic gestures. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have been more understanding of his efforts. But she had a reason (saving for a trip) and she was clear. So I think she's in the right. Answer B.\n"
