We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dating scenario where the author, let's call her Moja, told Jeremy she'd rather work on Valentine's Day instead of hanging out. Jeremy had planned a romantic evening, but Moja had already told him she didn't care for the holiday and preferred to work. Then Jeremy called her drunk and got upset when she stood her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for a month, seeing each other 2-3 times a week. She's not feeling a strong spark yet but is considering the possibility of a future. On Valentine's Day, she's working and told him upfront that she doesn't care for the holiday. Jeremy later reveals his elaborate plans, and Moja reaffirms her choice. Jeremy then gets angry and accuses her of being an asshole. Moja is now unsure if she was wrong.\n\nThe main question is whether Moja is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nFrom Moja's perspective, she communicated her preference clearly. She's saving money for a trip, values her job, and isn't into Valentine's Day. She might feel that Jeremy should respect her boundaries, especially since they've been seeing each other for a month. However, Jeremy's actions of planning a surprise might indicate he saw Valentine's Day as important in their relationship, possibly expecting her to reciprocate interest. \n\nBut did Moja have an obligation to change her plans? If she's clear and direct, and Jeremy didn't ask for her input before planning, maybe the fault lies with him for not respecting her initial communication. On the other hand, if Jeremy felt hurt because his plans were ignored, that's a different angle. \n\nThe argument for Moja being right: She communicated her stance, and Jeremy should have respected that. It's her time to work, and she has her priorities. The argument against: Maybe she didn't consider Jeremy's feelings enough, even if she was clear. Relationships often involve compromise, and maybe she could have found a middle ground. \n\nBut considering that Moja was upfront about not wanting to celebrate V-Day and that Jeremy went ahead with plans without checking in again, it seems like he might have misread the situation. Her response was consistent with her initial statement, so she's not necessarily in the wrong. The problem might be Jeremy's overreaction and lack of communication. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned her Eurail trip later might have triggered Jeremy's frustration, but that's part of her personal goals. She's not obligated to prioritize his romantic gestures over her own commitments. \n\nSo, in my view, Moja isn't in the wrong. She communicated her choice, and Jeremy's reaction was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
