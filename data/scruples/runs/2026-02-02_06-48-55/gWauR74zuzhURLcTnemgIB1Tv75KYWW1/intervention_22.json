We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by summarizing the situation as presented in the Reddit post.\n\nThe author is dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a fiery relationship. The author mentions there's no spark yet but maybe there could be. On a date, Jeremy asked about Valentine's Day plans, and the author directly told him they don't care for the holiday and prefer to work. Then, later, Jeremy calls the author drunk, tries to get her to change her mind, mentions elaborate plans (dinner reservations, carriage ride, rose bath), and gets upset when she won't budge. The author then feels conflicted because Jeremy worked hard, but also she was clear about her plans. The key points are communication, clarity, and whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nSo the author's stance is that she was clear from the beginning, and Jeremy made plans without considering that. She even gave an example of being clear when he asked. Jeremy, on the other hand, tried to push, even after she said no, and was drunk during the call. The user is torn because she feels bad but also Jeremy overstepped.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. Let's break down the elements.\n\nFirst, communication. The author was clear about not wanting to do Valentine's Day and preferring to work. That's important. Being upfront is usually a good idea. However, maybe there's a nuance here. She said it's not a holiday she cares about, so maybe Jeremy thought there was a chance she'd be open to it, even if she's not into the holiday. But she had already made her plans known when he asked, so he should have taken that as a no.\n\nThen, Jeremy's response. He made elaborate plans, which took two weeks. The author didn't mention these plans initially. But when he told her, he got upset. Why would she change her mind? Because he put effort in. But she was clear. Should she have considered that? Maybe, but she had already communicated her preference. It's possible that Jeremy didn't take her initial no seriously, especially since they were only a month into the relationship. Maybe he thought she was just being humble or didn't want to hurt his feelings, so he took the hint that maybe she was open to it. But she was explicit.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't tell him about her Eurail trip, which he found out later. That might have been a point of contention. If she had mentioned her plans, maybe he would have understood. But that's after the fact. The main issue is about Valentine's Day. \n\nAlso, Jeremy called her drunk and confrontational, which isn't healthy. Using a drunk call to push for something after she said no is not respectful. The author stood her ground, which is good. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? If she was clear and Jeremy didn't take it as a no, maybe he's at fault. But maybe she could have been more understanding. However, she had a valid reason to work (good money) and her preferences. The fact that he got angry and hung up suggests he overreacted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate. He didn't respect her boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B for No.\n"
