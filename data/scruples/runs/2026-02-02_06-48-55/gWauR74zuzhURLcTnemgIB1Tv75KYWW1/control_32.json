We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about Valentine's Day plans. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author, let's call her Moja, has been dating Jeremy for about a month. They've seen each other 2-3 times a week, but it's not a super intense relationship. She's not feeling a big spark yet but likes him. Jeremy asked about her Valentine's Day plans, and she told him she'd rather work and doesn't care for the holiday. Then later, Jeremy, after drinking, calls her and starts a tirade about the romantic plans he made. He got mad when she didn't change her mind, and they ended up arguing.\n\nSo the key points here: Moja was clear about her preferences before he made the plans. She mentioned working and not valuing the holiday. Jeremy made these elaborate plans without checking if she wanted to participate. When she stood by her initial refusal, he called her an asshole and hung up. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication. She was upfront. When he asked about her plans, she was direct. That's good communication. He then made plans based on his own desires without considering her stated preferences. Maybe he misunderstood or hoped she would change her mind, but that's on him for not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThen there's the part about the drinking. He was drunk when he called her, which might have made him more emotional. But even if he's emotional, if she was clear, he should have accepted that. His reaction of calling her an asshole and not respecting her decision is problematic. \n\nHer reasons are practical: she needs the money from working and has a trip planned. That's a valid reason. Also, she's not into the romantic gestures yet, which is okay. People have different love languages.\n\nHe made the plans after only two weeks of dating. Maybe that's too soon for such an elaborate gesture, especially if they aren't intimate yet. He might have assumed things would go a certain way without confirming. \n\nShe's torn because he put effort in, but she was clear. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not changing her plans after being upfront. It seems like she's not at fault. He didn't respect her initial decision, and his reaction was inappropriate. \n\nSo, answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here. She communicated her plans, he didn't respect that, and his behavior was unprofessional and rude. She's not the asshole for standing by her word.\n"
