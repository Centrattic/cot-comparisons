We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is dating someone named Jeremy for a month. They've seen each other a few times a week. The author isn't really into Valentine's Day and told Jeremy upfront that she prefers to work. Jeremy then spends weeks planning a romantic evening. The author later gets a call from Jeremy who's drunk, and he's upset she's working. She reiterates she's clear on her plans and they end up arguing. She's now torn about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The author was clear about not wanting to celebrate Valentine's Day and planned to work. Jeremy made elaborate plans after the author expressed her preference. The author's reasoning is that she's saving money for a trip, and she's clear from the start. But Jeremy got upset and acted out.\n\nFirst, was the author wrong to say no? She had already communicated her preference. Jeremy might have thought he could surprise her, but the author wasn't expecting to be surprised. In a relationship, even a new one, respecting each other's preferences is important. If someone is clear about their plans, the other person might be at fault for not respecting that. However, making a big effort could be seen as sweet, but maybe Jeremy misread the relationship's stage. They've been dating a month, not intimate yet, so maybe it's too soon for such a romantic gesture. The author isn't saying she doesn't like the gestures but that she prefers to work. \n\nJeremy's reaction of calling her an asshole and hanging up is problematic. That's not healthy, but the initial issue is Jeremy's response to her clear communication. The author isn't to blame for standing by her decision. She didn't agree to the plans, and it's her right to prioritize work. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. Jeremy's overreaction is his fault for not respecting her initial statement and then reacting poorly.\n"
