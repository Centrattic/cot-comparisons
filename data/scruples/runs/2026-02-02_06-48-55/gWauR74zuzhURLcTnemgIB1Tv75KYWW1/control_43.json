We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

They want me to answer A or B, where A is yes, the author is wrong, and B is no, they're not.\n\nSo the scenario: The author, let's call them \"Person A,\" has been dating Jeremy for about a month. They've been meeting 2-3 times a week, the relationship is not super intense, maybe a bit casual, and there's no big spark yet. On Sunday, Jeremy took Person A to a hockey game, which they love. Then he asked about Valentine's Day plans. Person A was clear they don't care for the holiday and prefer working for the money. They gave a hug and thought that was the end of it.\n\nLater, Jeremy called when drunk, asked again if they'd reconsider. When they said no again, he went into a tirade about the plans he made: a dinner at a fancy restaurant, carriage ride, rose petal bath. They clarify they didn't tell him about their Eurail trip, which is their reason for working on VDay. Jeremy ends up telling Person A they're acting like an asshole. Then he texts a non-apology the next day, making Person A question if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Person A was upfront about not wanting to celebrate VDay and would rather work. Jeremy, on the other hand, spent time and money planning a romantic event without checking if that's what Person A wanted. Even after being told directly, he called them out when drunk and got angry. \n\nIs Person A in the wrong? Well, they didn't force Jeremy to plan anything. They were clear about their preferences. It's their choice to work, and they have a valid reason (saving for a trip). Jeremy's reaction was inappropriate, especially ending the call by saying they're an asshole and then a half-hearted apology. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that Person A should have been more considerate or adjusted for Jeremy's effort. However, Person A was clear from the start. They didn't hide their feelings about the holiday. Jeremy's actions seem to be overstepping by creating elaborate plans without mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the timing: two weeks into the relationship, which is still fairly new. It's possible Jeremy misread the level of commitment or was too eager, but that doesn't make Person A wrong for not wanting to engage in a holiday they don't care for. \n\nPerson A's statement about preferring hockey and hot wings vs. romantic settings shows their personal preferences. They didn't say they hated romantic gestures entirely, just that they don't care for the holiday. Jeremy's assumption that Person A must want the same level of romance as him might be his issue. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. Person A communicated their choice. Jeremy didn't respect that and acted out. So the answer is likely B, Person A is not in the wrong. They had a right to make their own plans, and Jeremy's response was the problem.\n"
