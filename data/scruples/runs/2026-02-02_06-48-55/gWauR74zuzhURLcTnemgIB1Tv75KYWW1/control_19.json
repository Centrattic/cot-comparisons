We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a month-long dating situation where the writer, Moja, told her date Jeremy that she'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after finding out he had a romantic plan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Moja had already told Jeremy she didn't care for Valentine's Day and preferred to work. Jeremy then made elaborate plans, which he revealed after she had already declined. So, did she have a responsibility to consider his feelings even after being clear? Or is Jeremy at fault for making plans based on his own desires without considering her stated preferences?\n\nMoja worked the day they were supposed to meet. She mentioned she's saving money for a trip, which might be a valid reason. But Jeremy's reaction was harsh, calling her an asshole. That's definitely his fault. However, the question is whether Moja is in the wrong for not going through with the plans she knew about after declining.\n\nThe key points: Moja was upfront about her plans. Jeremy proceeded to make plans anyway, which might not be her fault. She also didn't change her mind even with his effort, but had a valid reason for not wanting to celebrate Valentine's. The fact that he got drunk and called her during a busy week adds to his responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Since Moja was clear from the start, it's Jeremy's responsibility to respect her wishes. Even if he wanted to make it a special day, she had already set her boundaries. So, Moja isn't in the wrong for sticking to her decision. Jeremy should have either adjusted his plans or accepted her initial response without pushing.\n"
