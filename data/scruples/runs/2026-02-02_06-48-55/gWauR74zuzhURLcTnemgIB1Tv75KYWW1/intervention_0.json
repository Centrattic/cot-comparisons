We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post. The situation is about a one-month dating relationship where the author, Moja, didn't want to spend Valentine's Day with Jeremy, who had planned a romantic evening. She told him she preferred to work and didn't care for the holiday, but he got upset and hung up on her. Now she's questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Moja and Jeremy have been dating for a month, maybe 2-3 times a week. They haven't even reached the kissing stage yet, so it's still pretty new. When Jeremy asked about her V-Day plans on Sunday, she was clear that she doesn't celebrate it and would rather work for the money. Then, two weeks later, he calls her after drinking, trying to get her to reconsider, which she already had. He blows up at her, calls her an asshole, and hangs up. She feels bad because he worked hard on the plans, but she was clear before.\n\nThe main issue here is communication and expectations. Moja was upfront when Jeremy asked about her plans, so he should have known not to make those arrangements. However, Jeremy went ahead and made elaborate plans anyway, which he then expected her to change. That's a problem because he didn't respect her initial decision. But Moja could have, perhaps, reiterated her plans again when she heard about his efforts, even if she wasn't going to budge. But she already told him directly, and he ignored that. His reaction of getting angry and hanging up is more inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship is still new, making such grand romantic gestures might be moving too fast for Moja's comfort. She might not be ready for that level of commitment or formality yet. The fact that he made plans without checking in again suggests he might have been trying to pressure her into a more serious relationship. Moja's priority is her work and personal goals, which is valid. She's not obligated to cancel or change her plans just because he made them. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe she could have handled the situation with more empathy, especially since he put in effort. But she already gave a clear answer, and he's the one who persisted and escalated the situation. The user initially thought she was in the wrong, but I think the fault lies more with Jeremy. He should have respected her wishes without trying to guilt-trip or pressure her. So the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
