There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant and won't take a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically close since last summer, so the pregnancy is unlikely. The son is really stressed, even physically ill, and the author is considering contacting the girl's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but since both are minors, there might be laws about underage relationships. However, the key issue here is the author's decision to contact the parents. Legally, the parents might have the right to get involved if their child is a minor and there's a pregnancy scare, but the author isn't a parent. So, is it their right to step in?\n\nEthically, the son is clearly distressed. The author is trying to protect their son's well-being and his future, especially with a scholarship at stake. But the girlfriend's parents should be the ones to handle their own child's situation. The author might be overstepping by contacting them without consent. However, the son is a minor too, and the author is acting in his best interest.\n\nThe situation also mentions that the girlfriend has a history of scare pregnancies and other partners, which complicates things. The author's son is still a virgin and doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy. The author is trying to resolve this to prevent further stress on their son.\n\nBut is it the author's place to contact the parents? The parents have the responsibility to care for their child, so maybe the author should encourage their son to talk to her parents himself. However, the son is 17, and maybe the author is trying to help because he's overwhelmed.\n\nIn some cases, involving third parties without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intention is good. The girlfriend might feel her parents are being invaded, and the author might be perceived as meddlesome. However, given the son's health is deteriorating, the author's concern is valid.\n\nThe law might vary, but in terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect their son, which is a parent's duty. The question is whether contacting the parents is an acceptable form of intervention. If the author's son is a minor, the parents might have some leeway, but if the girlfriend is 16, her parents are legally responsible for her decisions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in their son's best interest, but there's a line about respecting the other family's privacy. However, given the potential for a serious situation (pregnancy) and the son's well-being, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a better angle. Maybe the author should have encouraged their son to talk to her parents directly instead of doing it themselves. But since the son is scared and the author is trying to help, it's a gray area. Ultimately, the answer is B.\n"
