There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for potentially contacting their son's girlfriend's parents. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been in touch since last summer, and there's no chance of pregnancy. The girlfriend is refusing to take a test despite missing periods. The son is really stressed and physically ill because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both kids are minors, so there might be laws about contacting parents. But in some places, parents can get involved if there's a concern about their child's well-being. The author's son is clearly in emotional distress, so maybe the parent is acting to protect him.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend is 16 and legally, her parents are responsible for her. If the author is contacting them without consent, could that be an invasion of privacy? Although the situation is about a potential pregnancy, which might be considered an emergency. However, the author says there's no possible way the baby is his, so maybe the pregnancy is from someone else.\n\nThe son is trying to handle it by threatening to talk to her parents, but the author is stepping in. Is that overstepping? The parent's concern is valid because their son is in crisis. But the girlfriend's privacy rights might also be a factor. However, if the author contacts the parents, it might help resolve the situation, even if it's not their place.\n\nAlso, considering the son's well-being and future, like the baseball scholarship, the parent might think they're helping. But some might argue that the parent should let the son handle it himself since he's an adult in some contexts. However, since the son is 17, he's still a minor, so parents have some responsibility to intervene if necessary.\n\nThe answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to protect their son's health and future. But there's a nuance. If the author contacts the parents without a legal right or consent, that could be problematic. However, given the circumstances of the son's suffering and the potential for a false pregnancy claim (since they haven't been in contact), the parent's actions could be seen as justified. Also, the girlfriend's past behavior with other partners might indicate the pregnancy is not from their son, which adds to the parent's concern. So, B might be the right answer here.\n"
