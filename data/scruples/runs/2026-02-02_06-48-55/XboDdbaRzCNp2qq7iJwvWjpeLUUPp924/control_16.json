There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents. The situation involves a 17-year-old son and a 16-year-old girlfriend who might be pregnant. The parents are worried because the girl won't take a test, and their son is really stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both the son and the girlfriend are minors. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 17, so maybe they are within legal boundaries. However, the parents' concern is about the potential pregnancy and the girl's refusal to confirm it. \n\nThe mom wants to contact the girlfriend's parents if the girl doesn't take a test by the end of the week. But should a parent step in without the daughter's knowledge? The girlfriend is 16, which is close to 18 in some regions, but still a minor. In some jurisdictions, parents might have the right to be involved in their child's medical decisions, especially regarding pregnancy. But how does that apply here when the parents in question are not the girl's but the boy's?\n\nThe girl is avoiding her own parents, which complicates things. The mother is concerned about her son's well-being, which is understandable. However, contacting another minor's parents without consent might overstep. There's a privacy issue here. The girlfriend might not want her parents involved, and the mother is making a judgment call based on her son's distress.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the relationship dynamics. The son is being pressured into a situation he's not ready for, and the girlfriend's past behavior is mentioned. The mother might feel responsible to protect her son. But inserting herself into another family's matter could be seen as meddling.\n\nAnother angle: if the girl is indeed pregnant, there are legal implications regarding abortion or child support, depending on the location. If the mother contacts the parents, maybe she's trying to ensure proper medical attention for the girl, which could be a valid concern. However, the mother isn't the girl's guardian, so she might not have the right to make decisions on her behalf.\n\nIn some places, mandatory reporting laws might apply if there's a suspicion of underage pregnancy or other issues, but this isn't a clear case. The mother's action is a personal decision, not a legal requirement.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the mother's intentions are protective of her son, but the act of contacting the girlfriend's parents without consent could be seen as overstepping. The ethical dilemma here is balancing a parent's concern for their child's well-being against respecting another minor's privacy and autonomy. The answer might depend on cultural norms and specific laws, but generally, the mother might be in the wrong for not respecting the girlfriend's privacy and the rights of her parents to handle their own child's affairs.\n"
