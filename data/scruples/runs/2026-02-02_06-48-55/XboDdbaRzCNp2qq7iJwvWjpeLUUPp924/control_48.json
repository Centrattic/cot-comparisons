There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. \n\nFirst, the son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically together since last summer, so the pregnancy is unlikely. The son is really stressed, physically ill, and considering breaking up. The girlfriend is avoiding taking a test and hasn't told her parents.\n\nThe parent's main concern is for their son's well-being. They've tried talking to him every day, he's in bad shape physically and emotionally. The parent is thinking about contacting the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week. \n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, minors under 18 can't be forced to take a pregnancy test. The girlfriend's autonomy is a factor here. But the parent is worried about their son's health and future. The son is a junior, has a scholarship, and this situation is affecting his life. \n\nHowever, contacting the other parent without the child's consent could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend is a minor, so her parents might have some responsibility, but is it the mother's right to involve herself? There's also the aspect of privacy. The parent might be acting out of concern, but it's possible that the girlfriend's parents should be the ones to handle this. \n\nBut the girlfriend isn't taking responsibility, and the parent is trying to protect their son. The son is also a minor, so the parent might feel justified in trying to resolve the situation. However, there's a line between mediation and overreach. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents have a duty to protect their children's well-being, even beyond their own child. But the girlfriend's parents have their own role here. The parent's actions might be seen as interfering, even if with good intentions. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is a minor, so maybe her parents should be the ones to address this. The parent's approach could be problematic because it's the girlfriend's family's responsibility, not the mother's to contact them directly. Unless there's an emergency, but the situation is already causing the son significant distress. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're acting out of concern for their son, but there's a breach of privacy and possibly overstepping boundaries. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because contacting the other parents without consent could be seen as inappropriate, even if the motivation is good. The parents should perhaps encourage their son to talk to the girlfriend's parents himself or involve a trusted adult. The parent's direct involvement might not be the right approach here.\n"
