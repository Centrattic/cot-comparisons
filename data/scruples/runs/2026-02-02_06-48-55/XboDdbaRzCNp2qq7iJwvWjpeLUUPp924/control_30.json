There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old son, Sam, and his 16-year-old girlfriend, Jess. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really stressed and even sick because of it. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't get a test done by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both Sam and Jess are minors. In many places, parents have a legal responsibility to be involved in their minor children's medical decisions, especially regarding pregnancy. If Jess is 16, her parents might have the right to be informed if there's a potential pregnancy. But does the author have the right to contact them without consent?\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's son is clearly in distress. He's been physically ill, which is concerning. The author is trying to help their son, but is it overstepping to contact the girlfriend's parents? Jess might not want her parents to know, especially since she's avoiding them. But if she's a minor, maybe the parents should be involved regardless of her wishes.\n\nAlso, the relationship between Sam and Jess is complicated. They have different goals and values. The author mentions that Jess had previous partners, and Sam is still a virgin. There's also a past issue where Sam was rude to Jess, which led to some communication. Now, the author is trying to resolve a current crisis.\n\nThe key points here are the minors' ages, the potential pregnancy, the impact on both teens, and the author's intent to protect their son. Legally, in some jurisdictions, a parent or guardian might have the right to involve the parents of a minor child in such situations. However, there's a balance between protecting the teens' privacy and ensuring their well-being.\n\nThe author is acting out of concern for their son's health and future. The stress is affecting Sam's school and sports, which are important for his scholarship. But contacting Jess's parents could lead to conflict and might not be the best approach. However, if the author's actions are within legal boundaries and aimed at preventing a larger problem, maybe they're justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the right to contact Jess's parents without her knowledge, especially if it's against her wishes. But considering Jess's age and the potential severity of the situation (unconfirmed pregnancy), the author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect both children.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer isn't black and white. But given that both are minors and the author is trying to prevent a crisis, the author might not be in the wrong. The decision hinges on legal permissions and the intent to help their son, which is a parent's duty. However, there's a risk of overstepping, but in this context, it's more about protecting a child's health and future.\n"
