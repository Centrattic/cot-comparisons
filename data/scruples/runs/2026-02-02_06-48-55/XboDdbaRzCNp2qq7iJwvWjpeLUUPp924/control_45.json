There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting the son's girlfriend's parents. The situation involves their teenage kids. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they've been in a relationship for less than two months. They haven't physically been in touch since last summer, so a pregnancy is impossible. But the girlfriend thinks she's pregnant and won't take a test. The son is really stressed, vomiting, and so on. The parent is thinking about contacting the girl's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both teens are minors. In many places, parents have the right to involve themselves in their child's health matters, especially regarding pregnancy. However, there's also the issue of privacy and consent. The girlfriend's parents might be the ones to handle this, but the mother of the son is stepping in. \n\nThe son is clearly distressed, and the mother is trying to help him. But is it right for her to contact another parent without involving her own child's legal guardian? Also, the girlfriend's parents are the ones responsible for her healthcare decisions. If the girl is refusing to take a test, maybe the mother should first talk to her son's legal guardian (herself) or perhaps the school counselor? \n\nBut wait, the mother is the one who already has a history with the girlfriend, as she dealt with the son's previous behavior. She might feel she's already involved. However, contacting another parent directly without maybe going through the school or other authorities could be seen as overstepping. It might also violate the privacy of both teens. The mother's intention is to help, but the method of contacting the parents might not be the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl is a minor and not getting tested is affecting her health, then involving the parents could be necessary. The mother's concern is valid because the situation is causing her son severe stress. But the mother might be taking it upon herself instead of letting the girl's parents handle it. \n\nI need to check if the mother has the legal right to contact the girlfriend's parents. Since both are minors, maybe the mother is within her rights to protect her child's well-being. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The mother could be seen as overreaching, even if her intentions are good. \n\nAnother angle: the son and girlfriend's relationship is not stable, with different goals and values. The mother's action could be seen as trying to force a resolution to a problem that the teens themselves need to handle. But given the son's health is deteriorating, maybe the mother has a valid reason to act. \n\nIn some cases, schools or child protective services might need to be involved if a minor is in a harmful situation. But the mother is choosing to go directly to the parents. This could backfire if the girl's parents are not supportive or if it complicates the situation further. \n\nSo, considering all this, the mother's action is a mix of concern and possibly overstepping. It's a tough call between protecting her son and respecting boundaries. But since the mother is a parent acting to protect her child's health and well-being, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, there might be better ways to handle it, like involving a school counselor or the girl's parents through proper channels. But since she's planning to contact the parents herself, it's a bit of a breach of privacy. So, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she's crossing into the other parent's responsibility without going through appropriate steps. Or B (not in the wrong) because she's trying to help her son. Hmm.\n"
