There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their 17-year-old son, Sam, is in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, Jess, who might be pregnant. The parents are considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a pregnancy test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is around 16 or 17, but sometimes there are laws about the age difference. Since Sam is 17 and Jess is 16, that might be okay legally, but the parents might be concerned about the appropriateness given their ages and the short duration of the relationship. Also, there's mention that they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, which complicates things because if they haven't been intimate recently, the pregnancy claim might be unfounded. However, Jess has missed periods, so the possibility isn't completely ruled out without a test.\n\nThe author's son is extremely stressed, even physically ill and developing cold sores. He's a junior in high school with a baseball scholarship on the line, which is a big deal. The parents have tried talking to Sam every day, but he's not able to handle the situation with Jess directly. Sam is a virgin by choice, while Jess had several friends-with-benefits before. This suggests a potential imbalance in their relationship dynamics and responsibility around the situation.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author (the mom/dad) wrong to contact Jess's parents if she doesn't take the test? On one hand, the parents are trying to protect their son and help him through a stressful time. They might believe that Jess's refusal to take the test is prolonging the issue and causing unnecessary harm. On the other hand, contacting another family's parents without permission could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's Jess's personal medical decision. However, since the relationship is underage and the potential pregnancy is a serious matter affecting their son's well-being and future, some might argue that the parents have a responsibility to intervene, especially if their son is a minor and the situation is causing him significant distress.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If the parents are in a place where minors are allowed to make certain medical decisions, maybe Jess's parents should be the ones to approach her. But if the parents are worried about their son's mental health and the impact on his scholarship, which is crucial for his future, they might feel it's necessary to involve Jess's parents to get the situation resolved.\n\nThe parents have already dealt with Sam's past behavior, which could indicate they've had some involvement before. This time, they're considering direct action due to the severity of the situation. The ethical dilemma is between respecting Jess's autonomy and privacy versus protecting their son's well-being. Given that Sam is 17 and the parents are trying to support him, their intervention might be seen as justified, especially if Jess is not taking responsibility. However, there's a risk of damaging trust with Sam if he feels his parents are overstepping, but the parents' intention is to help him.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in their son's best interest and the situation is causing him serious harm. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other angles. Maybe the parents should first talk to Jess's parents through Sam's communication, but given the circumstances, the parents' action could be protective rather than intrusive. The key points are the minor ages, the potential impact on their son's future, and the girl's lack of action. So the parents might be justified in stepping in to get clarity for their son's sake.\n"
