There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents. The situation involves a 17-year-old son and his 16-year-old girlfriend, both minors. The girlfriend thinks she's pregnant but won't confirm, and the son is really stressed.\n\nFirst, legal ages. In the US, the age of adulthood is 18. Both kids are under 18, so they\u2019re still minors. The mother is considering contacting the girlfriend's parents because the girl isn't taking a pregnancy test. The son, Sam, is really suffering both emotionally and physically.\n\nNow, the mother's actions. She's trying to protect her son's well-being. But is it her place to contact another family's parents without their consent? There might be privacy concerns here. The girlfriend's parents might have their own say, but the mother is stepping in based on her son's distress. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend has a history of scare pregnancies and multiple partners. Sam is a virgin and doesn't want unplanned pregnancy. The mother's intention is to resolve the situation before it affects both teens' futures. However, contacting the parents without the son's approval could be seen as overstepping. The mother might be violating the privacy of the girlfriend by reaching out to her parents without her knowledge. \n\nBut considering the minors' ages and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy, the mother could argue she's acting in their best interest. However, the ethical dilemma here is about privacy versus protection. There's also the issue of whether the mother has a right to involve herself in the girlfriend's family matters. The mother's son is a victim here, but her approach might not be the right way to handle it. The right action might be for the mother to encourage her son to talk to a professional or for the parents to get involved through proper channels, like school counselors or medical professionals. \n\nAnother angle: the mother might be overstepping by contacting the girlfriend's parents directly. It's possible the girlfriend's parents might not want to know, or it could cause more conflict. The mother's actions could be seen as meddling, even if with good intentions. \n\nIn summary, while the mother's concern is valid, the method of contacting the girlfriend's parents without their consent or the son's agreement might be considered overstepping. The author could be in the wrong because she's taking a direct approach that might infringe on the privacy of the other family. The appropriate step might be to involve school authorities or medical professionals instead.\n"
