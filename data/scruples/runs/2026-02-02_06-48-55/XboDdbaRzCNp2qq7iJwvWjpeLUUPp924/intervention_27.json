There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 17-year-old son, Sam, is in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, Jess. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't do a test by the end of the week. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 16 or 17 is close. However, some states might have specific laws about close-in-age relationships. The author's son is 17, and Jess just turned 16. Depending on the state, their relationship might be legal, but that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by contacting Jess's parents. Let's think about parental rights and privacy. Jess is a minor, so her parents have some responsibility over her health and well-being. If she's potentially pregnant and not taking a test, the parents have a right to know, especially if it's a health concern. However, the author is not Jess's parent; they might be stepping over into Jess's family's territory here.\n\nBut then, there's the impact on Sam. He's really stressed, physically unwell, and his future is at stake with a scholarship. The author is trying to protect their son from an unplanned situation. But is it their place to intervene in another parent's child's life? Maybe the author should first talk to Jess's parents through their son or maybe involve a school counselor or a medical professional instead of directly contacting them. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that Sam had previously acted poorly towards Jess, which the author addressed. So maybe the author has some history here. But even so, contacting the parents without the child's consent could be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, the parents of the other child might have a right to know if their daughter is in a situation that could affect her health and future.\n\nAnother angle: Jess's refusal to take a test might be due to fear or stigma, and the author's involvement could either support her or add pressure. If the author contacts the parents, it might lead to a resolution where Jess gets the test done, but it could also cause her to feel betrayed if Sam initiated the contact. \n\nLegally, in some places, if there's a suspicion of a minor being pregnant, it might be a reportable concern. But the author is not a mandated reporter unless they're a school staff or certain professional. So maybe the author isn't legally required to report, but ethically, there's a question.\n\nSo, the author is trying to help their son, but the method of contacting the other parents could be seen as violating Jess's privacy. The right approach might be to encourage Jess to take the test herself, perhaps with the support of her own parents, or to involve a school counselor or healthcare provider. \n\nHowever, given that Sam is a minor and the potential pregnancy could affect both their futures, the author might feel it's necessary to step in. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, the author's son's well-being is a priority. But the author isn't Jess's parent. So the answer might depend on the balance between the son's well-being and respecting the boundaries of another family. \n\nI think there's a case to be made either way. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their child. On the other, they're interfering in another family's affairs without the consent of the other party. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they're overstepping their role as a parent of the other child's partner. But I'm not 100% sure. Another perspective might say that in a situation where a minor's health is at risk, contacting the parents is reasonable. \n\nBut Jess is 16, a minor, so her parents have authority. If she's not getting the test done, maybe the author is right to involve the parents. However, the author is not Jess's parent, so it's a bit of a gray area. The key point is whether the author has the right to contact Jess's parents without her consent. \n\nIn the US, parents can share concerns about their child's partner if there's a legitimate health issue. But it's a delicate situation. The author might be justified in their concern, but the method could be seen as overstepping. The correct approach might be to talk to Jess's parents through the school or a counselor rather than directly. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is on a bit of a slippery slope. They're in a tough spot, but contacting the parents without Jess's consent or through proper channels might be considered overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
