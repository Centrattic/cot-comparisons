      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the mom is in the wrong for considering contacting her son's girlfriend's parents. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kids are teenagers: Sam is 17, Jess is 16. They've been dating less than two months and haven't been physically in touch since last summer. Jess thinks she's pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really stressed, even getting sick, and he's worried about the future because he's aiming for a baseball scholarship. The mom is thinking of contacting Jess's parents because she's concerned for Sam and Jess, and Jess isn't taking responsibility.\n\nSo, the main points here are the ages, the potential pregnancy, the stress on Sam, and the mom's intervention. In some places, there are laws about parental notification for minors, especially regarding pregnancy. The mom isn't a legal parent to Jess, so contacting her parents might be a way to get support. But is she overstepping?\n\nJess is 16, which is underage in many places. The mom isn't the parent, so maybe she's trying to protect her son. However, Jess might view this as an invasion of privacy. The mom's son is suffering, and she's trying to help him by getting involved. But is that right? Alternatively, maybe she should let the parents handle it, but Jess is refusing to talk to them. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and privacy. Jess might not want her parents involved, and the mom contacting them without permission could be seen as violating Jess's autonomy. But considering Jess is a minor, parents have a role in her wellbeing. The mom's actions could be seen as necessary to ensure Jess gets help, especially if there's a pregnancy. \n\nThe key factors are: the minors' ages, the pregnancy concern, the stress on Sam, and the mom's intent to protect her son and help Jess. The mom's approach might be right if it's to ensure Jess gets medical attention, but it might be wrong if it's overstepping by bypassing Jess's wishes. However, since Jess is refusing to act, the mom's intervention could be justified, especially if she's not the legal parent. \n\nI need to consider if the mom is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether intervening is appropriate when a minor is at risk. If the mom believes Jess is in a potentially dangerous situation (pregnancy), then contacting her parents might be the right step. But if Jess is 16, in some regions, parents or legal guardians are responsible for minors, so the mom might not be in the wrong. However, the mom isn't Jess's parent, so she's stepping into a role that might not be hers. \n\nGiven the circumstances\u2014Jess not taking responsibility, Sam's health deteriorating, and the potential pregnancy\u2014the mom's concern is valid. But legally and ethically, is it her place? Maybe not. Jess's parents have the responsibility. However, since Jess is avoiding them, the mom might feel compelled to act. It's a tough call. But considering the minors involved and the potential consequences, the mom might not be in the wrong if her intention is to help. So, answer B.\n"
