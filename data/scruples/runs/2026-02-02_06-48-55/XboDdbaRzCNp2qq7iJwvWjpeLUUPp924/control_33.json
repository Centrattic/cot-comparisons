There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's underage girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and won't take a test.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The son, Sam, is 17, and the girlfriend, Jess, is 16. They haven't been physically together since last summer, so the pregnancy can't be his. But Jess thinks she's pregnant, missed periods, refuses to take a test. Sam is really stressed, even physically ill, and is considering breaking up if she doesn't get tested. The parent is thinking about contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take the test by the end of the week. There's also a history where Sam was an asshole to Jess, leading to some conflict. Jess has had other partners before, and Sam is a virgin by choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for planning to contact Jess's parents. Let's break it down.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, both are minors, so parents generally have a role in their children's lives. However, contacting another parent without consent might be a privacy issue. But since the potential pregnancy is a serious matter, especially involving minors, some might argue the parent has a right to step in to protect their son and ensure the situation is resolved.\n\nEthically, the parent is concerned for their son's well-being. Sam is suffering physically and emotionally. The parent is trying to address a situation that could have serious consequences for both teens. Jess's refusal to take a test is creating unnecessary stress and uncertainty. By contacting Jess's parents, the parent might be trying to get the necessary support for Jess to take the test, thus resolving the issue.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respecting the privacy of the other family. The parent might be overstepping by contacting Jess's parents without permission. But given that the teens are underage and the situation is urgent, some might see it as a necessary step to prevent potential problems.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Jess has a history of not communicating with her parents and has had multiple partners complicates things. The parent's action could be seen as trying to ensure responsibility from Jess's side as well.\n\nBut there's also the possibility that the parent is acting out of frustration and not considering Jess's feelings or autonomy. However, given the age and the potential consequences of pregnancy for a minor, the parent's concern might be justified.\n\nI think the key points are the minors' ages, the seriousness of the potential pregnancy, and the parent's intent to resolve the situation. While there's a privacy concern, the parent's actions are aimed at protecting their son and ensuring a responsible resolution. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but I need to check if there are any other factors I'm missing.\n"
