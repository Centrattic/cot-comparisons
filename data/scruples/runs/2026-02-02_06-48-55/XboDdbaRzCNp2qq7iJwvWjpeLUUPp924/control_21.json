There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend (16) is possibly pregnant and hasn't taken a test, even though they haven't been physically in contact since last summer. The son is 17, and their relationship is only two months old.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: In the U.S., the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 16 is the minimum in many states. Since the girlfriend just turned 16, it might be legal depending on local laws. However, the parents might still have concerns.\n\nThe parent's main issue is the girlfriend not taking a pregnancy test and the son being extremely distressed. The parent plans to contact the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week. The question is whether this action would be wrong.\n\nEthically, parents have a duty to protect their children. The son is clearly suffering, and the parent is trying to help. But contacting another family's parents can be seen as overstepping. However, given the son's age and the situation, the parent might feel it's necessary to intervene, especially if the girlfriend isn't taking responsibility.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior (not taking tests, previous scare, FWB partners) adds complexity. The parent's previous involvement (dealing with the son's messages to the girlfriend) shows prior engagement. The parent is trying to resolve this to protect the son's well-being and future, especially with his scholarship at stake.\n\nLegally, if the relationship is legal, the parent's direct intervention might not be wrong. But ethically, the parent should consider the girlfriend's right to privacy and autonomy. However, given the age and the potential consequences of pregnancy, the parent's concern is valid.\n\nThe key points are the parent's intent to protect their son and the girlfriend's refusal to take action. The parent's approach might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm, but it's a close call. The answer likely leans towards not being in the wrong (B), as the parent is acting in their son's best interest under stress.\n"
