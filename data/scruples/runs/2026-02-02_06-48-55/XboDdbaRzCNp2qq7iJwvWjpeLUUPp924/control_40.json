There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been physically in touch since last summer. The girlfriend thinks she's pregnant but refuses to take a test. The son is extremely stressed and their relationship is causing a lot of problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both the son and daughter are minors, so their parents have a responsibility to step in if there's a potential pregnancy. However, the parent is thinking about contacting the girlfriend's parents directly. Legally, the parents can be involved in their child's affairs, especially if there's a health issue. But ethically, is it right to contact another parent without the child's consent?\n\nThe parent mentions that the son is in a lot of physical distress\u2014vomiting, migraines, etc.\u2014which is a sign of severe anxiety. The son is also on track for a scholarship, which adds pressure. The girlfriend's refusal to take a test is causing this situation. The parent wants to intervene because they're worried about their son's well-being and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach is to contact the girlfriend's parents. While the intention is good, maybe the parent should first try to get the daughter to take a test, perhaps with the son's parents guiding her. But since the daughter refuses to talk to her parents, maybe the parent is trying to bypass that and contact the parents directly. Is that appropriate?\n\nIn some cases, involving another parent without the child's consent could be seen as overstepping. The parent could be seen as violating the daughter's privacy. Even though the parent's son is involved, they might not have the authority to make decisions for the girlfriend. On the other hand, the parent is acting out of concern for their son's health and future.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the girlfriend's behavior. She has had past relationships and this isn't her first scare, which might indicate a pattern. The parent might be trying to protect their son from further harm. But the right approach would be to encourage the daughter to take responsibility and take the test first. Contacting her parents could lead to conflict and might not resolve the issue if the parents are not supportive.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents might have the legal right to be involved in their child's health matters, especially regarding pregnancy. However, the ethical question is whether the parent should act without the daughter's consent. The parent's actions might be seen as meddling, even if well-intentioned. The parent's son is 17, which is close to adulthood, but still a minor, so his parents have a duty to protect him.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent is not in the wrong because they're trying to protect their son's well-being and prevent a potential crisis. However, the method of contacting another parent directly without the daughter's consent might be questionable. But given the severity of the situation and the son's health, it's a difficult call. The parent's main goal is to resolve the uncertainty and help both teenagers make informed decisions. So the answer is likely B (No), but there's a nuance here. However, since the options are A or B, and the parent's actions are driven by concern, the answer is B.\n"
