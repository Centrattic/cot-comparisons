There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. \n\nFirst, the son is 17 and the girlfriend is 16, but they haven't been physically in touch since last summer. The relationship is only two months old. The girlfriend has missed periods and is refusing a test, causing the son significant stress. The parent is thinking of contacting the girlfriend's parents if the girl doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, considering the age of both teens, there's a legal aspect here. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 17, so if they were physically intimate, it's a legal matter. But the parent mentions they haven't been \"in touch\" since last summer, which might mean they were in a relationship before but haven't been in contact recently. However, if the girlfriend is pregnant, even if the parent believes the baby isn't their son's, the situation is still serious.\n\nThe parent's intent is to involve the girlfriend's parents to get the situation resolved, as the girl isn't taking responsibility. The son is clearly suffering from anxiety and physical symptoms, which the parent is trying to address. The parent also mentions that the girlfriend has a history of casual relationships, which adds to the concern.\n\nIs the parent overstepping? Well, the girlfriend is a minor, so her parents have a right to be involved in her health decisions. If the girl is not taking care of herself or the potential child, the parents might have a duty to step in. However, the parent (the original author) isn't the girl's parent, so contacting her parents might be an overreach. But given the situation's gravity\u2014possible pregnancy, teen's well-being\u2014some might argue it's justified to protect both teens. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy and consent. The parent isn't the guardian of the girlfriend, so contacting her parents without her consent might be seen as interfering. However, if the situation is truly an emergency and the girl's parents aren't taking action, maybe the parent's concern is valid. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific laws in their area. But generally, while the parent is motivated by concern for their son's health and the situation, involving another minor's parents without their knowledge could be seen as crossing a line unless there's a legal obligation or imminent danger. However, given the potential for a teen pregnancy and the girl's refusal to take a test, some might say the parent isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering the factors, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent's actions are driven by concern for their son's well-being and the serious implications of a teen pregnancy, even if it means involving the other parent's family.\n"
