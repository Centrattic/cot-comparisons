There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom is wrong for considering contacting her son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because the girl might be pregnant but won't take a test. The mom's son is 17, they haven't been physically together since last summer, and the girl is now missing periods. The son is really stressed and even sick, and they both have their academic and athletic futures at stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, minors have certain rights, and parents might have responsibilities to protect their child's well-being. Since the girl is 16, her parents might have a role here. But the mom is not the girl's parent, so stepping in could be seen as overstepping, unless there's a valid concern for her health or safety.\n\nThe situation involves a possible pregnancy, which is a medical issue. If the girl is refusing to take a test, it's possible she's in denial or scared. The mom's son is 17, and while they're both minors, the mom is concerned about the impact on her son's future, especially since he's on track for a baseball scholarship. The daughter's refusal to confirm or deny the pregnancy is causing him significant stress, leading to physical symptoms.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong for considering contacting the other parents. Legally, in some jurisdictions, parents might be required to report child abuse or neglect, but this isn't that case. Ethically, the mom might feel she's acting in her son's interest, but the girl's parents are the ones responsible for her care. However, since the girl is an adult in some places (if the US state allows 16-year-olds to be married or make medical decisions), but maybe not.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the girl's autonomy. She might not want her parents involved, especially if she's had past issues. The mom's son mentioned she had previous partners, which complicates things. The mom's son is a virgin by choice, which is valid, but the situation is causing him severe stress.\n\nSo, the mom's intention is to ensure the girl gets tested, but doing so by contacting her parents might be an invasion of privacy unless there's an immediate danger. However, the girl's health is important too. If the mom is acting out of concern for both her son and the girl's well-being, maybe it's justified. But she's not the girl's parent, so it's a gray area.\n\nIn some places, minors can consent to medical treatment for pregnancy, so the mom might not need the girl's parents to get a test. But if the mom is contacting the parents without the girl's knowledge, that could be overstepping. The ethical dilemma here is balancing the son's right to know and the girl's right to privacy and autonomy.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether contacting the parents is the responsible thing to do for the girl's health and to resolve the uncertainty affecting her son. But if the mom isn't a legal guardian, she might be overreaching. Still, given the potential health risks of an undiagnosed pregnancy and the stress on her son, some might argue it's justified.\n\nHowever, the mom's son is also a minor, and the girl is 16, so their parents might have a role in ensuring their well-being. The mom could be trying to involve the girl's parents to handle the situation properly. On the other hand, it's possible the girl's parents are unaware of the situation, and the mom's action could be seen as meddling.\n\nIn terms of the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" aspect, the community might see it as the mom being reasonable to protect her son and the girl's health, or as overstepping. The answer here would depend on the specific laws and norms of the region, but generally, if the mom's action is to ensure a medical test for the girl's health and to address the uncertainty causing her son's distress, it might not be considered wrong. However, if the action is more about controlling the situation without respecting the girl's autonomy, it could be seen as the mom being in the wrong. Given the context, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
