There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for considering contacting her son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, is possibly pregnant and not taking a test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The son, Sam, is 17, and Jess is 16. In the U.S., the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 16 or 17 is the minimum in some states. However, there might be issues if there's a significant age difference, but here they're close in age. The mother mentions they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, which might be a red flag. Wait, but if Jess is pregnant, how could that be? Maybe there's a misunderstanding or maybe there was contact earlier.\n\nThe mother is concerned because Jess refuses to take a pregnancy test, and Sam is really stressed out. Sam is a junior in high school, on track for a scholarship, and this situation is affecting his health. The mother wants to contact Jess's parents to get her to take a test. \n\nThere's also a side note that Sam was a bit of an ass to Jess earlier, and she sent screenshots to the mom. The mom dealt with that. Also, Jess has had other partners before. Sam is still a virgin by choice. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the mom is in the wrong for contacting Jess's parents. Legally, the parents might have a right to know if their child is potentially pregnant, especially since Jess is a minor. But there's also the issue of privacy and consent. However, given that Jess isn't taking responsibility, maybe the mom is justified in stepping in. \n\nBut Sam is 17, so he's an adult in some contexts. However, since he's a minor, his parent might be involved in his decisions. The mother is trying to protect both her son's future and Jess's well-being. If Jess is pregnant, that's a big deal for both teens. \n\nI think the mother isn't in the wrong here. Her intentions are to get the situation resolved for the health and future of both teens. She's acting out of concern, even if the approach might be unconventional. The fact that Jess refuses to take a test makes the mother's actions more understandable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
