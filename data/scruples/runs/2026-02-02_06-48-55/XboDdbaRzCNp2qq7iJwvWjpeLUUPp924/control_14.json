There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to contact their son's girlfriend's parents. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, which is more than a few months ago. The girlfriend thinks she's pregnant but won't take a test. The son is really stressed and physically unwell because of this. The parent is considering contacting the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies, but both are minors. However, since they haven't had contact since last summer, maybe there's a time factor here. But the main issue is whether the parent is justified in contacting the girlfriend's parents. \n\nThe parent is concerned about their son's well-being and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy. The son is a junior, has a scholarship, and is on track for a good future. The girlfriend's history with multiple partners and past scares might be a factor, but the parent is trying to protect their son. \n\nHowever, contacting another parent without consent could be seen as invasive. The parent is stepping into the girlfriend's family's affairs, which might not be their place. The girlfriend is a minor, so her parents have a right to know if there's a potential pregnancy. But does the parent of the son have the right to inform them? \n\nAlso, the son is 17, so he's almost an adult. Maybe the parent should have a conversation with him first and see if he can handle it. The girlfriend's parents might be the ones to handle it, but the parent's intention is to protect their son. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the girlfriend's autonomy. Even though she's a minor, she might not want her parents involved. But she's not taking responsibility by not taking a test. The parent might be trying to force a resolution. \n\nLegally, in some states, the parent might not be able to contact the other parents without the daughter's consent. Ethically, it's a gray area. The parent's concern is valid, but the approach could be problematic. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No) because the parent is acting in their son's best interest, trying to resolve a situation that's affecting his health and future. However, there's a consideration of privacy and the right of the girlfriend's parents to be informed. But since the parents might not be aware of the situation, the parent's action could be justified as protective. But maybe the right approach is to talk to their own son first and see what he can do. However, given the son's age and the situation, the parent might feel it's necessary to step in. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
