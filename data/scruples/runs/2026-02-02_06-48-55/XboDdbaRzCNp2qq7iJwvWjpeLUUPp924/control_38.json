There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's son, Sam, who's 17, is in a relationship with Jess, 16. Jess might be pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really stressed, even physically sick, and they haven't been in contact since last summer, so the baby can't be his. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both Sam and Jess are minors. In many places, the legal age for parental involvement in such matters is 18. So, if Jess is 16, her parents would typically be the ones to handle this. However, the author is not Jess's parent, so maybe there's a privacy issue here. But given that they're minors and the situation could impact Sam's life, maybe there's a justification.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author's son is clearly distressed, and the author is trying to help him find a solution. Jess's refusal to take a test is causing significant emotional and physical harm to Sam. The author's concern is about both Sam's well-being and the potential consequences if the pregnancy is real. But does that give the author the right to contact Jess's parents? Or is it better to let Sam handle it himself, perhaps with the support of his own parents?\n\nAlso, there's a history mentioned where Sam was previously acting badly towards Jess, which she reported. The author dealt with that, so maybe there's a prior relationship between the families. But even so, contacting the parents without Jess's consent might be overstepping. Jess's privacy is important, even if she's a minor. However, since she's under 18, maybe her parents have a right to be informed about such a serious matter.\n\nAnother point: the author mentions that Sam is in a good position for a scholarship, and the couple has different goals. The author might be trying to prevent a situation that could derail Sam's future. But is it right for a parent to interfere in their child's relationship like this? There's a line between helping and overstepping.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents are legally allowed to inform other parents if their child is involved in a situation that could lead to pregnancy or other issues, especially if minors are involved. However, it's possible that the author might be violating Jess's privacy or overstepping their authority.\n\nOn the other hand, given the minors' ages and the potential consequences, the author's intentions are to protect Sam and ensure clarity. But the method of contacting Jess's parents without her consent or the knowledge of their own parents might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should encourage Sam to talk to his own parents or seek professional help first.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, maybe not, since they're dealing with minors and the parents might have a say. Ethically, it's debatable. The author's intentions are to help their child, but the method might be intrusive. However, without more specific legal knowledge about the jurisdiction, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, parents might be expected to support their child in such situations rather than contacting the other family directly.\n"
