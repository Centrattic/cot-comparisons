There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girl might be pregnant and refuses to take a test.\n\nFirst, the son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been in touch physically since last summer. The relationship is only two months old. The girlfriend has missed three periods and thinks she might be pregnant but won't confirm. The son is extremely stressed, physically ill, and considering breaking up but is worried about the repercussions. The author is thinking of contacting the girl's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 16 is the minimum in some states. However, since they're both minors, there might be other considerations. Legally, can a parent contact another minor's parents without consent? It's a gray area. Some might argue that the parents have a right to step in if there's a potential pregnancy involving their child's well-being, especially if there's a risk to the minor's health or future. Others might say that the parents are overstepping by contacting the girlfriend's parents without the girl's consent.\n\nEthically, there's the aspect of the girl's autonomy. She's an adult in terms of age, so even if she's a minor, she might have the right to make her own decisions. However, if she's refusing to take a test and causing significant harm to her partner, there's a concern about responsibility. The parents might feel it's necessary to intervene for the well-being of both teenagers.\n\nThe son is also a minor, but he's 17. His parents are worried about his health and future, especially his college prospects. The parents might feel they have a duty to protect him, especially since he's still under their care. However, contacting another family's parents without their knowledge could be seen as invasive.\n\nAnother angle is the previous incident where the son was acting inappropriately, and the girl sent messages to the parents. That might have already established some level of parental involvement. But now, the parents want to step in again, possibly overstepping if they haven't been invited to do so by the girlfriend's family.\n\nThere's also the issue of the girlfriend's past behavior. If she's had other \"friends with benefits\" partners and this isn't her first scare, the parents might be concerned about her maturity level. However, the parents should be careful not to judge the girl without knowing the full story. They need to consider if their actions are based on facts or assumptions.\n\nIn terms of the potential consequences: contacting the parents could lead to a confrontation, possibly legal if the other parents feel their privacy is invaded. It might also escalate tensions between the teenagers, leading to public embarrassment or further stress for both the son and the girlfriend.\n\nThe main question is whether the parents have the right to step in. Legally, if the girl is 16 and in a state where that's the age of majority for certain decisions, the parents might not have legal standing. Ethically, it's a tough call. The parents have a vested interest in their son's well-being but need to respect the autonomy of the other family's child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' intentions are to protect their son, contacting the girlfriend's parents without consent could be seen as overstepping. The appropriate step might be to encourage their son to talk to a trusted adult or a healthcare provider, or perhaps involve a school counselor if that's an option. Directly contacting the girlfriend's parents might not be the best approach and could lead to more complications. So, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're invading the privacy of another family without proper consent or a legal basis.\n"
