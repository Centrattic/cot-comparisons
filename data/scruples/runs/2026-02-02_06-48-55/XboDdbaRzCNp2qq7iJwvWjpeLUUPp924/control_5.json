There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, might be pregnant and refuses to take a test. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nSam is 17, Jess is 16. They haven't been physically together since last summer, which is more than 6 months ago. The relationship is only a couple of months old. Jess has missed 3 periods, but she's not taking a test. Sam is really stressed, physically unwell, and considering breaking up but is scared of her reaction. The parent is thinking of reaching out to Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week. Also, there's a side note about Sam having previously acted badly towards Jess this summer, which she documented and sent to the parent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). So I need to evaluate the ethical and legal aspects here.\n\nFirst, legal considerations: In many places, minors have certain rights regarding their health information. If Jess is 16, she might be considered a minor, and her parents might have a right to know about potential health issues. However, if the parents are not being consulted, the parent might be overstepping. But if Jess is refusing to talk to her parents, maybe the parent is justified in stepping in if they believe there's a risk.\n\nEthically, the parent is concerned about their son's well-being. Sam is clearly suffering, and the parent is trying to help. However, contacting Jess's parents without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy. But if there's a legitimate concern about a possible pregnancy that could affect both teens' futures, the parent might feel it's necessary.\n\nAnother angle: The parent mentions that they've already dealt with Sam's past behavior towards Jess. This suggests that there were prior issues. Now, Jess might be using the pregnancy scare as a way to manipulate Sam or as a consequence of her own actions. The parent is trying to resolve this to protect their son's mental and physical health, as well as his academic and athletic future.\n\nBut there's a risk here. Contacting Jess's parents could escalate the situation. If Jess is in a state where she's not taking tests and avoiding her parents, maybe there's more going on. However, the parent might not be the right person to approach Jess's parents without her knowledge. It's possible that the parent is overstepping by not letting Sam handle the situation, even though he's a teenager.\n\nAlso, considering the teens' ages, they are both minors. The parent might have a duty to ensure that both teens are making informed decisions, but again, contacting Jess's parents directly might be crossing a line. The parent should perhaps first try to get Jess to take a test with the help of Sam or maybe contact a trusted adult or counselor. Alternatively, if they believe there's an immediate health risk, they might need to involve authorities or a medical professional, rather than the girlfriend's parents directly.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, it's illegal to disclose someone's health information without consent, which could include a parent sharing their child's situation with another parent. So legally, the parent might be in the wrong if they contact Jess's parents without her consent and without a legal basis.\n\nEthically, the parent's actions are motivated by concern for their son's well-being, which is understandable. However, the method of contact might not be appropriate. The parent should consider other avenues first, like encouraging Jess to take a test, involving a school counselor, or a healthcare provider. Contacting Jess's parents directly could lead to conflict and might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, considering that Jess's parents might not be aware of the situation, the parent's action could be seen as meddling. However, if there's a genuine concern for their son's health and the potential for a serious situation (like an unplanned pregnancy), the parent might feel compelled to act. But this is a gray area.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intentions are good, but the method of contacting Jess's parents could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's done without Jess's consent and without considering other resources. Legally, it might be a violation of privacy, and ethically, it's questionable unless there's a clear risk. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're interfering without proper channels. However, some might argue B (not wrong) because they're trying to protect their son. But I think the legal and ethical issues tip towards A.\n"
