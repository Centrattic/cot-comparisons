He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's son, Sam, is 17, and his girlfriend Jess is 16. They haven't been in touch since last summer, so the pregnancy can't be his. Jess thinks she's pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really upset, even physically ill. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here.\n\nStarting with the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so their relationship might be legal. However, the parents might have their own rules. But the author's main concern is Jess not taking a pregnancy test, which is causing Sam a lot of stress.\n\nThe author is a parent, so their concern for their son's well-being is understandable. Sam is under a lot of pressure\u2014academic, athletic (baseball), and personal. The fact that Jess has a history of scare tactics and multiple FWB partners adds complexity. The author mentions that Sam is still a virgin by choice, which might explain why Jess's pregnancy scare is so distressing for him.\n\nNow, the author is considering contacting Jess's parents. Why? Because Jess isn't taking responsibility, and Sam is suffering. The author's son is a minor, so maybe the parents have some responsibility here. But is it the author's place to contact Jess's parents? Let's consider privacy and boundaries. Parents usually handle their children's issues, but if Jess is 16, her parents are responsible for her as well. If Jess is withholding information that's harming Sam, perhaps the author has a right to step in to protect their son.\n\nHowever, there's a possible breach of privacy here. The author is not Jess's parent, so contacting her parents without her consent might be an invasion of privacy. Also, Jess might feel that her autonomy is being violated. But the author argues that Sam is in a bad state and they need to resolve this for his well-being.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be overstepping, especially if there's no legal obligation for them to act. But if the situation is causing Sam severe harm, maybe the author has a duty to protect their child. The author mentions that Sam is going to talk to Jess's mom himself if she doesn't take a test, which is the trigger for the author considering contacting Jess's parents.\n\nAlso, the author has already dealt with Jess sending messages to them about Sam's behavior. This history might indicate that Jess is not communicating effectively, which could justify the author's intervention to prevent further issues.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author's intent is to protect their son. However, the method involves contacting another person's parents without their consent. That could be seen as interfering in another family's affairs. But given the circumstances, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn terms of wrong-doing, the author is a parent trying to help their child. If Jess's inaction is causing Sam serious harm, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a potential for overstepping boundaries. But given the severity of Sam's condition, the author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect their child.\n\nSo, weighing all factors: the author's intention is to help their son, who is in distress. The method involves contacting another's parents, which is a delicate matter, but the author has a valid concern. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, hence answer B.\n"
