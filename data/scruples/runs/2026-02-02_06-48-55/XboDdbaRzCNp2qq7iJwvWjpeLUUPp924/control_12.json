There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old boy named Sam whose 16-year-old girlfriend, Jess, might be pregnant but won't take a test. The author, Sam's parent, is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't get tested by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so the relationship itself might be legal depending on the jurisdiction. But the key issue here is whether the parent has the right to contact Jess's parents without Jess's consent. \n\nJess is a minor (16), so her parents are her legal guardians. However, the parent (the author) isn't Jess's own parent. The parent is Sam's mom or dad. The parent is considering reaching out to Jess's parents because Jess is refusing to take a pregnancy test, which is causing significant distress to Sam. \n\nThe author's motivation is to help their son, who is clearly in a lot of emotional and physical distress. But is it the parent's place to contact another minor's parents without the minor's consent? That might cross a privacy boundary. However, since both are minors and the situation is potentially life-altering, maybe the parent is justified in trying to get outside help to resolve the issue. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is trying to prevent a possible problem (if Jess is actually pregnant) by getting her parents involved. Jess's parents would have legal responsibility in that case. But the parent might be overstepping by acting without Jess's knowledge. However, if the parent's son is suffering and the situation is urgent, maybe it's a necessary step. \n\nAlso, considering that the relationship is new and the couple has different goals, the parent might be trying to protect their son's future. But does that justify contacting another family's parents? It's a delicate balance between respecting privacy and acting in the best interest of their child. \n\nIn some cases, parents might feel they have the right to step in if their child is in emotional distress, but the legal boundaries here are a bit unclear. The parent's action could be seen as helpful intervention or as meddling. \n\nThe key factors here are: the minors' ages, the potential life-altering situation (possible pregnancy), the emotional state of Sam, and the fact that Jess is refusing to take a test. The parent is trying to resolve a problem that affects their son, but the method (contacting Jess's parents) could be seen as overstepping. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their intention is to help their son and prevent a crisis. However, it's a close call. The fact that Jess is a minor and her parents are responsible means that the author might have a valid reason to involve them, especially if Jess isn't taking the situation seriously. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should let the teens handle it themselves with their own parents. But given the severity of the potential consequences, the parent's action is understandable. So I'll go with B.\n"
