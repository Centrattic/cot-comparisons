There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for wanting to contact their son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because she might be pregnant and refuses to take a test. The son is 17, and they haven't been physically in touch since last summer. The author is considering stepping in after the girlfriend misses three periods and the son is extremely stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the U.S., the age of consent varies by state, but since both are minors, if they are under the age of consent for their state, the situation might involve statutory rape. However, the user says they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, which is important. If the relationship is non-physical now, maybe the pregnancy isn't possible, but that's what the author is trying to confirm by getting a test.\n\nThe author's son, Sam, is in a lot of emotional distress, vomiting, migraines, cold sores. That's a serious concern. The mother is trying to help her son, who is on track for a scholarship and has a future. The girlfriend, Jess, has a history of scare tactics with other partners and a casual relationship approach. She's avoiding her parents, which might be due to fear or other reasons.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, the author is trying to protect her son and ensure that Jess takes responsibility. However, contacting Jess's parents without her consent could be seen as overstepping. Parents have a duty to protect their children, but also need to respect privacy and boundaries. If the author contacts Jess's parents, it could be a breach of trust, especially if there's no legal requirement to do so. \n\nBut since both are minors, and there might be a potential pregnancy, which is a medical issue, the parent might have a valid reason to intervene. However, the author's son is also a minor, so his ability to handle the situation independently is limited. The key here is whether there's a legal or ethical obligation to inform Jess's parents. \n\nIn some states, parents are required to report if they suspect a minor is pregnant, but that might depend on the specific laws. The author isn't certain and is using the son's distress as a justification. The mother's actions could be seen as trying to prevent a potential crisis, but forcing the issue might backfire, damaging the relationship between Jess and her parents or causing more harm to Sam.\n\nAlso, the author's son had previously behaved in a way that led to messages being sent to his mother, so there's some past history. But now the situation is reversed, with Jess possibly being pregnant. The mother's concern for her son's well-being is valid, but the method of contacting her girlfriend's parents might not be the best approach. It could be more appropriate to involve a trusted adult, a counselor, or the school. \n\nThe main ethical question is whether the mother is respecting Jess's autonomy by contacting her parents. However, considering the minors' ages and the potential gravity of a pregnancy, the parent might believe that Jess isn't mature enough to handle it alone. It's a tough balance between privacy and the well-being of their son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the contact is made without a legal mandate and without considering other channels first, it might be seen as overstepping. But if the situation is dire and the son is in crisis, the parent's concern is understandable. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction and the approach taken. However, generally, parents should probably handle it through other means first, like involving school authorities or healthcare professionals, rather than directly contacting the girlfriend's parents. That said, if the mother is acting in her son's best interest and Jess's parents are the best option to ensure responsibility, maybe not in the wrong. But the fact that the author is considering this without knowing if it's necessary (since the pregnancy might not be real) could be problematic. The answer is likely A, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
