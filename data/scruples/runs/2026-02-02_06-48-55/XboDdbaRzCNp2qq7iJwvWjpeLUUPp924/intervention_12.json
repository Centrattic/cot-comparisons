There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the parent of a 17-year-old son) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant and won't take a test.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The son, Sam, is 17; the girlfriend, Jess, is 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so the pregnancy is unlikely. They're in a two-month relationship. Jess has missed three periods and refuses to take a test. Sam is extremely stressed, physically unwell, and considering breaking up. The parent is thinking of contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week. Also, there's some history where Sam was accused of acting like an asshole, and Jess sent messages to the parent. The author mentions that Jess had other partners before this relationship, and Sam is a virgin by choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, parental rights might be on the parent's side since both are minors. But ethically, this is tricky. The parent is concerned about their son's well-being and future, especially with a scholarship. However, contacting the girlfriend's parents without consent could be seen as overstepping, especially since the daughter is a minor. The parent might argue that they're trying to protect their son, but they're also inserting themselves into another family's affairs. Also, respecting Jess's autonomy is important, even if she's a minor. Since the pregnancy is unlikely, maybe the parent is acting on fear rather than facts. But the parent's actions could be seen as necessary due to the potential impact on their son's life. However, involving Jess's parents might not be the right approach; maybe they should talk to Jess directly or seek professional help. The parent's previous actions (dealing with the messages) show they've already intervened, which might justify further action. But the main issue is whether they have the right to contact the other parents. In some contexts, parents might have a responsibility to protect their children, but crossing into another's parenting role could be problematic. So, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because they're violating privacy and parental boundaries, or B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect their son. Given the situation, the parent's intentions are good, but the method might be wrong. So, likely A.\n"
