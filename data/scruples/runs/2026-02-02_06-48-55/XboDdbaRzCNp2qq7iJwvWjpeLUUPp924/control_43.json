There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend thinks she's pregnant but won't confirm it.\n\nFirst, the son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been in touch since last summer, so the pregnancy isn't possible. The girlfriend has missed periods and is not taking a test. The son is extremely stressed, physically ill, and they're in a new relationship with differing values. The parent is considering contacting the girlfriend's parents because the son is desperate and the situation is causing him significant distress.\n\nThe key points here are the ages of the teenagers, the lack of a current physical relationship, and the parent's concern for their son's well-being. The parent is trying to protect their son from potential emotional and academic consequences. However, contacting the girlfriend's parents without her consent might breach privacy. But given the circumstances\u2014possible pregnancy scare, son's health issues, and the fact that the teens aren't even in touch anymore\u2014it's a tricky situation.\n\nOn one hand, the parent wants to resolve the issue before it escalates. On the other, respecting the girlfriend's privacy is important. But since the girlfriend is a minor, her parents might have a right to be involved. Also, the parent has already dealt with past issues from the girlfriend. The parent's main goal is to get clarity for their son, which is reasonable. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions might be justified to prevent further harm to their son, even if it's an unusual approach. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
