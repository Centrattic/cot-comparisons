There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (Sam's mom) is in the wrong for considering contacting Jess's parents because Jess might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. \n\nFirst, the key points: Sam is 17, Jess is 16, they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, and the relationship is only a couple of months old. Jess has missed three periods and is refusing to take a test. Sam is really stressed and unwell, and the mom is thinking of contacting Jess's parents if Jess doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: In many places, parents are legally allowed to involve themselves if there's a potential pregnancy, especially if the girl is a minor. But there's also the issue of privacy. Jess might not want her parents to know, and the mom is stepping in without Jess's consent. \n\nEthically, the mom's intention is to help Jess and protect her son. But is it right to bypass the girl's parents and directly contact them? If Jess's parents are unaware, maybe they should be involved, but the mom is taking the initiative without the girl's consent. However, if Jess is a minor, her parents have a right to be involved in her health decisions. \n\nAlso, the mom mentions that Jess sent screenshots of Sam's messages to her, indicating some prior issues. The mom had already dealt with that. Now, she's trying to help Sam who's in a lot of stress. The fact that Jess has had previous scare pregnancies and is in a relationship with different values adds complexity. \n\nBut legally, the mom might be within her rights if she's trying to prevent a potential crisis. However, the method of contacting Jess's parents without her knowledge could be seen as overstepping. There's a line between helping and interfering. \n\nThe main question is: Is the mom in the wrong? If Jess is a minor, her parents should be involved regardless. But the mom is acting without Jess's consent. However, if there's a risk of an unplanned pregnancy, especially with a minor, maybe the mom has a duty to act. \n\nOn the other hand, Jess's privacy and autonomy are important. The mom might be justified if she's trying to prevent harm, but there's a risk of violating Jess's trust. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the mom is in a tight spot. She's trying to help her son and prevent a potential crisis. Since Jess is a minor and the situation is urgent, the mom's action might be justifiable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
