There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents over her possible pregnancy. \n\nFirst, the son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been in physical contact since last summer, so a pregnancy isn't possible. The girl has missed three periods and is refusing to take a test. The son is deeply affected, physically and emotionally. The parent wants to reach out to the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, contacting someone's parents without their consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, since the girl is a minor (16), her parents might have a right to know about potential health issues. But the parent is not the girl's parent, so stepping in could be crossing a boundary. \n\nThe son's well-being is a concern here. He's suffering physically and emotionally, and the parent is trying to help. However, the parent's action might be seen as interfering in the relationship without the daughter's consent. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. The son is handling the situation by threatening to contact the girl's mom, which shows he's desperate. The parent's intervention might be a last resort to protect their son and ensure the girl takes responsibility.\n\nBut legally, unless there's a risk of harm, the parent might not have the right to contact the girl's parents. Ethically, it's a gray area. The parent's intention is to help their son, but the method could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the girl's autonomy is a factor. She's an adult (depending on the state, 16 might be considered an adult for some legal purposes), but since she's a minor in most places, her parents might have a right to be involved in her health decisions. However, the parent isn't her parent, so this complicates things.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent might be in the wrong because they're overstepping by contacting another person's parents without a clear legal right or consent. However, given the son's distress and the girl's refusal to take action, the parent's intention is to help. It's a tough call between ethics and legality. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, contacting the parents of a minor without a legitimate reason could be seen as an overreach. The parent's motivation is to protect their son, but the action might not be legally justified. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
