There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant but won't take a test.\n\nFirst, the son is 17 and the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so a pregnancy is impossible. The girlfriend has missed three periods but won't take a test. The son is extremely stressed, physically unwell, and considering breaking up if she doesn't take a test. The parent is thinking of contacting the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't act by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is wrong. The key points here are about privacy, consent, and the legal/ethical boundaries of parental involvement. Both the son and the girlfriend are minors, but the parent's involvement in contacting the other's parents might overstep. Even though the parent is concerned about their son's well-being, the girlfriend's parents should be the ones to handle their child's medical decisions. Also, the parent's actions could lead to legal issues or damage trust. The fact that the son is pressuring the girlfriend to take a test and then the parent stepping in might not be the right approach. The girlfriend's privacy and autonomy, even as a minor, should be respected unless there's a direct threat to safety, which the parent hasn't mentioned here. So, the parent might be in the wrong by overstepping their role. Answer A.\n"
