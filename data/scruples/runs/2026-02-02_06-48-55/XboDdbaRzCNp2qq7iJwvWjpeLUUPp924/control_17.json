There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for considering contacting her son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and won't take a test. The son is 17, and they haven't been in contact for months. The situation is causing the son a lot of stress, and the girlfriend has a history of scare pregnancies.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, the age of consent for contacting minors can vary, but the mother is the parent of the son, so her intentions are to protect her child. However, contacting the girlfriend's parents without her consent might be seen as an overreach. The girlfriend is 16, so she's a minor, but her parents are her legal guardians. The mother might have a valid concern for her son's well-being, but she's stepping into another family's privacy.\n\nEthically, the mother wants to resolve this quickly because the girlfriend is avoiding responsibility. The son is suffering, and the girlfriend's actions are impacting him. However, the mother isn't the one responsible for the girlfriend's decisions. Her son is 17, which is close to adulthood, and maybe he should handle this on his own. But since he's a minor and still under his parents' care, the mother might feel it's her duty to intervene.\n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to take a test is a problem, and the fact that she's avoiding communication with her parents suggests she's scared or in denial. The mother's action might be seen as necessary to get the situation resolved, but it's also respecting the other family's boundaries. If the mother contacts the parents, it could lead to conflict or the girlfriend feeling betrayed. But if she doesn't, the son's mental health continues to deteriorate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the son's future. He's on track for a scholarship, and this situation could derail that. The mother's concern is valid, but she's taking a step that could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy and the son's well-being, some might argue it's justified.\n\nIn terms of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...), the user is asking if the mother is doing something wrong. The answer depends on balancing the need to protect her son with respecting the other family's privacy. Since the son is a minor and heavily affected, and the girlfriend is also a minor, the mother might not be in the wrong. But there's a risk of overstepping. However, considering the severity of the situation, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
