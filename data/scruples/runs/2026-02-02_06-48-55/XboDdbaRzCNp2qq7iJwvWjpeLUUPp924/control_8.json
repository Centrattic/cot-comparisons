There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents. The situation involves a 17-year-old son and his 16-year-old girlfriend, Jess, who might be pregnant but refuses to take a test. The parent, Sam's mom, is considering reaching out to Jess's parents if she doesn't act by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both minors are underage, so there might be some legal implications here. In many places, parents are responsible for their children's health and well-being. Jess is 16, so her parents have legal authority to make medical decisions for her. If Jess is pregnant, even if the parents aren't directly responsible for the situation, they have a right to know for their child's health. However, the parent is making a judgment call based on what they think is best for their son and the potential consequences.\n\nNext, the parent's motivations. They mention that their son is extremely stressed, physically ill, and this could affect his future, like a baseball scholarship. They want to protect him and ensure Jess isn't putting her health at risk by not getting tested. But is it their right to involve Jess's parents without her consent? There might be a privacy issue here. Jess might see this as an invasion of her privacy, especially if she wanted to handle it without her parents knowing. \n\nThen, there's the relationship between Sam and Jess. The parent describes them as incompatible, with different goals and values. The parent might be trying to end the relationship by creating pressure, but is that fair? They mention that Sam is still a virgin and doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy, so this could be a way to push Jess into taking responsibility. \n\nAnother angle is the previous incident where Sam was acting poorly, and Jess sent screenshots. The parent dealt with that, which might influence their current actions. They might be biased, thinking Jess is manipulative or that the situation is a \"trainwreck.\" However, without knowing the full context of the messages, it's hard to judge.\n\nLegally, in some states, a parent can have a say in a minor's healthcare, but ethically, it's more complicated. The parent's action could be seen as overstepping if Jess didn't consent to sharing this information. However, given the potential health risks and the impact on their son, the parent might feel it's necessary.\n\nAlso, considering the well-being of both teens. If Jess is pregnant and doesn't get tested, it could lead to health risks. The parent might be acting in her best interest as well, even though she's a different family. But maybe the best approach would be to encourage her parents to get involved through other means first, like talking to Jess's parents indirectly or suggesting professional help.\n\nIn summary, the parent's intention is to prevent harm and protect their son's future, but the method involves contacting another family without consent. Whether this is right depends on the balance between privacy rights and the duty to prevent harm. There's a strong argument that the parent is trying to help, but the method could be problematic. The answer might hinge on cultural or legal norms in their area, but without that info, it's a judgment call. However, since both are minors and the parent has a legal right to act in their child's best interest, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But if privacy is a higher priority, then A. I'm leaning towards B because the parent is trying to address a potential health issue affecting their son and another minor.\n"
