There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been in touch since last summer. The girl, Jess, thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test or tell her parents. The son, Sam, is really stressed and even physically ill because of this. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents to make her take a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent for medical decisions is 18, so the parents might have some authority here. But the author isn't the parent; they're the parent of the son. So stepping into that role might be overstepping. However, since the potential pregnancy affects their son's well-being, maybe there's a concern there.\n\nEthically, the author's intention is to help Jess take responsibility, which is understandable. But does Sam have the right to push Jess to take a test, and by extension, have his parent contact her parents? Jess's autonomy is important here. She's a minor, so her parents should be involved in medical decisions. But the author isn't her parent. Contacting them without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship is new, and they haven't been in contact since summer. If the pregnancy is not possible from their relationship, maybe there's another explanation, but the author's son is still worried. However, the author's main concern is for Sam's health and future. Sam might be a victim of emotional manipulation here.\n\nOn the other hand, Jess's parents should be the ones to handle her health issues. The author contacting them could cause conflict but might also be necessary for Jess to get the medical attention she needs. There's also the aspect of Jess's previous behavior, like sending screenshots to Sam's parent. Maybe this shows a pattern of seeking external help from parents, which could justify the author's action.\n\nBut legally, the author isn't in a position to make decisions for Jess. They might be overstepping their role. Even if the intention is good, it's not their place to contact her parents. The correct approach might be for Sam to communicate with Jess and her parents through proper channels, maybe with the help of a trusted adult or counselor.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're not the legal guardian of Jess and shouldn't be making decisions for her. However, their concern for their son's well-being is valid. But ethically, it's better to let Jess's parents handle the situation. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're crossing boundaries by contacting another's parents without their consent, even with good intentions.\n"
