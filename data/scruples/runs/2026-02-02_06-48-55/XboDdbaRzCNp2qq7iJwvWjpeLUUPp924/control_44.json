There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents. The situation is that the girlfriend, Jess, might be pregnant but won't take a test. The son, Sam, is 17 and a junior about to play baseball. He's really stressed and even getting sick. The parents are worried about the potential impact on his future, scholarships, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both Sam and Jess are minors, 17 and 16 respectively. In the US, the age of majority is 18, so they're both under 18. However, the legal age for consent varies by state. If they had a relationship, depending on the state, there could be statutory rape laws involved. But the user mentions they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so maybe that's not the case here. Still, it's a factor to consider.\n\nNext, the parents are considering contacting Jess's parents because she's not taking responsibility. The main issue is whether the author has the right to do that. Since Sam is a minor, his parents might have some responsibility to protect him, especially if there's a potential pregnancy. However, Jess is also a minor, and her parents should be involved in her health decisions. But is it the author's place to contact them? They might be overstepping, but they're trying to protect their son.\n\nSam is in a lot of emotional distress. His parents are concerned about his well-being. The girlfriend's refusal to take a test is causing him significant stress, affecting his health and his ability to focus on school and sports. The parents might feel they have no other option but to contact Jess's parents to resolve the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is circumventing Jess's privacy. Even though she's a minor, there's an expectation of privacy. However, since her parents are her legal guardians, they have a right to be involved in her health decisions, especially regarding pregnancy. The author's action could be justified as a last resort to get the situation under control for both children's sakes.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent. If the author contacts Jess's parents without their consent, is that respecting Jess's autonomy? But since she's a minor, perhaps the parents have a responsibility to step in if their child is in a risky situation. The author might be acting out of concern for their son's future and his mental health.\n\nAnother angle: the author's son is still a minor, so his parents have a duty of care. If there's a possibility of an unplanned pregnancy, it's a significant life event that could affect both teens' futures. The parents might feel they need to take action if the teens aren't handling it responsibly.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should first exhaust all other options. Have they tried working with their son to find another way to get Jess to take a test? Maybe encouraging him to talk to a healthcare professional or a counselor? But given the urgency and the son's deteriorating health, time is a factor. The author might not see other options left.\n\nAlso, the context mentions that Jess had previous FWB partners and that Sam is a virgin by choice. This might indicate that Jess's behavior is a concern, and the parents are worried about her reliability. But that's subjective. The author's actions are in response to a specific situation where their son is suffering.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between respecting privacy and protecting the well-being of minors. Since both are minors, the parents' actions might be justified as part of their duty to protect their son. However, contacting Jess's parents without her knowledge could have repercussions. Jess's parents might be upset, or it could damage the trust between Sam and Jess.\n\nBut given the circumstances\u2014Sam's health, the potential pregnancy, and the impact on his future\u2014it's a difficult call. The author might be in the right because they're trying to protect their son and resolve a situation that the teens aren't handling adequately. Alternatively, they might be overstepping by not going through proper channels first.\n\nI think the key points here are the minors' age, the parents' responsibility to protect their children, and the urgency of the situation. Since Sam is 17 and the situation is affecting his health and future, the author is acting to protect him. Jess is a minor, so her parents should be involved in her health decisions. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
