There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, is possibly pregnant and won't take a test. \n\nFirst, the son is 17 and the girlfriend just turned 16. They haven't been physically together in months, so the pregnancy is unlikely. But Jess is missing periods and the son is really stressed, even getting sick.\n\nThe parent wants to step in if Jess doesn't take a test by the end of the week. The parent feels justified because the son is suffering, and there's a history of the son being an asshole to Jess before, which she reported. Also, their relationship goals don't align.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so they might be within legal bounds, but the parent is worried about the pregnancy. However, contacting another parent without permission could be seen as overstepping. Privacy is a factor here. Jess is a minor, so her parents might have a right to know, but the parent hasn't consulted the son's parents first. The son mentioned he would talk to her mom himself, so the parent is following through on that. \n\nAlso, the parent is trying to protect their son's future, especially with a scholarship. But intervening by contacting the other parents could be seen as invasive. However, the parent might argue it's necessary for the well-being of their son. \n\nMoral standpoint: Is it right to involve other parents if the girlfriend won't take responsibility? The parent is acting out of concern for their son's health and future. But the method of contacting the parents without prior discussion might be seen as wrong. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the parent's actions are overstepping or a justified protective measure. The parent might not be in the wrong given the circumstances, but it's a close call. Given the son's distress and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy, the parent's intent is protective. However, the method of contacting the parents might not be the best approach. But since the son had already said he'd contact them, the parent is following through. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent's actions are motivated by concern for their son's well-being and future, and they are following through on a commitment the son made to take action if needed.\n"
