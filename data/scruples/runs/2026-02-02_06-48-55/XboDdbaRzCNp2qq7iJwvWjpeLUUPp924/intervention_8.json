There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author, who is the mother of a 17-year-old son named Sam, is in the wrong for considering contacting her son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents, Jess, because Jess hasn't taken a pregnancy test and Sam is really stressed about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Sam is 17, Jess is 16. They haven't been in touch since last summer, and their relationship is less than two months old. Jess thinks she's pregnant but won't confirm. Sam is really unwell, both physically and emotionally. The mother is considering contacting Jess's parents if Jess doesn't take a test by the end of the week. The mother's reasoning is that it's for her son's health and well-being, and to prevent a potential problem.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, in the US, parents or legal guardians have some responsibility over their minor children. Jess is 16, so her parents might have a right to be involved if there's a pregnancy scare. However, Jess is an adult (assuming the age of majority is 18), so maybe the mother's right to contact her parents is questionable. Wait, Jess is 16, so she's still a minor. So her parents are her legal guardians. If Jess is refusing to take a test, maybe the mother has a point in involving Jess's parents because they have a duty of care. But on the other hand, there's the aspect of privacy and consent. \n\nThe mother is doing this out of concern for her son's health. Sam is 17, so almost an adult, but still a minor. The mother might feel responsible for his well-being. However, there's also the question of overstepping. Is it the mother's place to involve Jess's parents without Jess's consent? Even if Jess is a minor, her parents might be the right people to contact, but is the mother allowed to do that without Jess's permission? \n\nAnother angle: the mother mentions that Sam is considering breaking up if Jess doesn't take the test. The mother's action here is to protect Sam's future and mental health. But by contacting Jess's parents, could she be causing more stress or conflict? What if Jess's parents are not supportive? Also, there's the fact that Sam had previously acted like an \"asshole,\" which the mother had dealt with. That might indicate some underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nEthically, the mother is trying to prevent a crisis by taking proactive steps. But there's a balance between being proactive and violating privacy. Since Jess is a minor, her parents might need to be involved regardless. However, does the mother have a right to contact Jess's parents without Jess's knowledge? That's a big question. Legally, if there's a concern about a minor's health, maybe a parent could step in. But this is a gray area because it's a teenager's situation.\n\nAlso, the mother is acting because Jess isn't cooperating. If Jess's parents are her legal guardians, they should be the ones handling this. But the mother is not Jess's parent. So, the mother's action could be seen as overstepping. However, given that Sam is her son and she's worried about his well-being, maybe it's justified. But is it her place to make that decision without involving Jess's parents through proper channels?\n\nAnother point: The mother's son is a minor, so she has a legal responsibility to protect him. If Jess is pregnant, there are legal and medical considerations. But again, without knowing for sure, the mother is acting on a possibility. \n\nIn some cases, if there's a suspected pregnancy in a minor, authorities might get involved. But the mother is a private party here, not an authority figure. So she's stepping into a role that might not be hers. However, if she's acting in good faith to protect her son and prevent a crisis, maybe it's understandable. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If Jess's parents are the legal guardians, maybe the mother should contact them, but maybe she should first talk to Jess, or involve a school counselor, or another authority figure. Jumping straight to contacting Jess's parents might be violating privacy or overstepping. However, given the urgency and the son's health, maybe it's a necessary step. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Jess is refusing to take a test. If she's a minor, her parents could force her to take one, but the mother isn't in that position. The mother's action could be seen as trying to bypass Jess's refusal by going to her parents. Legally, that might be the right move because the parents have authority. \n\nBut ethically, is it right for the mother to take that step without Jess's knowledge? That's a tough call. On one hand, the mother is trying to protect her son. On the other, it's a privacy issue for Jess and her relationship. \n\nI think the answer depends on the legal framework. Since Jess is a minor, the mother's action might be justified to protect her son's health. But if there's a way to involve a school counselor or a trusted adult first, that might be better. However, given the situation described, the mother is acting out of concern and the son is suffering. \n\nBut the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) aspect is about social norms. In social terms, is the mother overstepping by contacting Jess's parents? Or is she doing the right thing? In some opinions, it's justified because she's a parent trying to help her son. Others might say it's a violation of privacy. \n\nGiven the context, the mother's action is likely to be seen as necessary by some and overstepping by others. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nConsidering that Jess is a minor and the parents have a responsibility, and the mother is acting to prevent a crisis, I might lean towards B. But if the mother is not following proper channels (like going straight to parents without involving a counselor or school), maybe it's A. However, the mother's actions are in response to her son's health crisis. \n\nIn the end, if Jess's parents need to be involved because Jess is a minor, then the mother isn't in the wrong. But if she's violating Jess's privacy without cause, maybe she is. The key is the mother's intent and the minor status of both teens. Given that, I think the mother isn't in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
