There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant and not taking a test. The son is 17, the girl is 16, and they haven't been in contact since last summer. The parent is worried about their son's health and the potential for a false pregnancy or a real one that could disrupt both their futures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but both 16 and 17 are minors in most states. If they had a relationship, there could be legal implications depending on the state's laws. However, the user mentions they haven't been in contact since last summer, so if there was no recent physical contact, maybe the legal concern is lessened. Still, the parent is considering contacting the girl's parents, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The parent is trying to protect their son's well-being. Sam is physically ill, which is a significant concern. The parent's actions are driven by worry for their son's health and future. But contacting the girlfriend's parents might invade her privacy. The girl is a minor, so her parents have a right to know if their child is potentially pregnant. However, the parent isn't the girl's guardian, so they might not have the right to share this information without her consent.\n\nThe parent also mentions that the son was previously behaving badly towards the girlfriend, leading to some conflict. This adds complexity. The parent might feel justified in stepping in because of past issues, but that could be seen as using the pregnancy scare as an excuse to meddle.\n\nThe mother's main concern is the son's health and future. She's trying to prevent a situation that could derail both their lives. However, the method of contacting the other parents could be seen as a privacy violation. The legal and ethical lines here are blurry. In some cases, it's a parent's responsibility to protect their child, but the means of doing so are important.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions might be legally and ethically questionable. Contacting the girlfriend's parents without her consent could be seen as overstepping, but the parent's intentions are to protect their son. However, the right approach might involve counseling their son and involving authorities if necessary, rather than contacting the other family directly. So the answer could be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're invading the girl's privacy without proper cause.\n"
