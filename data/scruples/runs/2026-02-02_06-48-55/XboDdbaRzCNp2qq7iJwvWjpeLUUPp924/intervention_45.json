There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (Sam's mom) is in the wrong for considering contacting Jess's parents because she's not taking a pregnancy test. \n\nFirst, the situation: Sam is 17, Jess is 16. They haven't been in physical contact since last summer, and the relationship is only two months old. Jess is missing periods and thinks she's pregnant but won't confirm. Sam is really stressed, even physically ill. The mom is thinking about contacting Jess's parents if Jess doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the mom's reasons: She's worried about Sam's health and future, especially since he's on track for a scholarship. Jess isn't taking responsibility, and there's a history of Jess having scare pregnancies before. Also, there was a past issue where Sam was acting badly, and Jess sent screenshots to the mom. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether contacting Jess's parents is the right move. Legally, in the US, parents might have some standing to involve themselves if there's a minor involved, but usually, that's if there's a legal concern like underage pregnancy or something. But Jess is 16, which is under the age of majority (18), so maybe the mom is within rights to contact her parents if she's concerned about her daughter's well-being. However, Jess is a minor, so perhaps the mom is overstepping because it's not her responsibility to involve herself in Jess's medical decisions. \n\nOn the other hand, Sam is a minor too. The mom is acting in her son's best interest. But does that justify contacting another parent without their knowledge? It could be seen as interfering in another family's affairs. Jess might feel betrayed by her parents if they find out through Sam's mom instead of her own choice. Also, Jess might not want her parents involved, especially if she's already avoiding them. \n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as trying to force Jess's hand, which might not be the right approach. It's possible that Jess has her own reasons for not taking a test, like fear of her parents' reaction, or maybe she's trying to avoid confirming something she's not ready to face. The mom stepping in could add pressure on Jess without considering her perspective. \n\nBut the mom is also considering the impact on Sam's life, his scholarship, and his health. She's trying to protect her son from a potentially overwhelming situation. However, the mom's approach might not be the best. Instead of contacting Jess's parents, maybe she should encourage Sam to talk to Jess directly, or maybe seek medical advice for Sam if he's that unwell. Alternatively, she could talk to Jess's parents if there's a legal or health emergency, but this isn't clear here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a parent, maybe the mom's duty is to her son, but she's overstepping by involving another family. The key factors are the ages of the kids, the lack of physical contact, the fact that Jess is avoiding responsibility, and the mom's role in mediating. \n\nI think the mom is overstepping by planning to contact Jess's parents without a clear legal necessity. Jess is a minor, but the mom isn't her legal guardian. The mom's actions might cause more harm by invading Jess's privacy and possibly damaging the relationship between the families. The right approach might involve encouraging Jess to take responsibility, supporting Sam, but not involving other parents without a valid reason. So the answer is A, the mom is in the wrong.\n"
