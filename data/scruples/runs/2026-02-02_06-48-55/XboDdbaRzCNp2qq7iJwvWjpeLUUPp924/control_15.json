There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 17-year-old son, Sam, is in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, Jess. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test or talk to her parents. Sam is really stressed about this, even getting physically ill. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but since Sam is 17 and Jess is 16, in some states that's okay, but in others, it might be considered statutory rape if there's a significant age difference. Wait, the author mentions that they haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so maybe there's no recent activity. But the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me check again. The author says the relationship is less than two months old, but they haven't been in physical contact since last summer. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If they haven't been intimate recently, then pregnancy is unlikely. But Jess is missing periods, which could still be due to other factors.\n\nNext, the author's main concern is for their son's well-being. Sam is extremely stressed, even to the point of vomiting and migraines. The author is trying to protect him from potential harm if there's a pregnancy. However, contacting Jess's parents without her consent might infringe on Jess's privacy. But Jess is a minor, so her parents have some rights. But since the author is a parent too, maybe they have grounds to act in their son's interest.\n\nThe author mentions that Jess has a history of scare tactics with previous partners and that she sent screenshots of Sam's messages to the author. The author dealt with it before, so there's a history of conflict. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents to get her to take a test, which could prevent a potential crisis.\n\nNow, the question is whether this action is wrong. Legally, as a parent, the author might have the right to act in their child's best interest, especially if there's a potential underage pregnancy. However, Jess's parents might be the ones to handle their daughter's situation. But since Jess refuses to talk to them, maybe the author is justified in stepping in to ensure she gets the test done.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's no actual physical contact recently, maybe the author is overreacting. But Sam is in a fragile state, and the author is trying to protect him. The ethical angle here is about respecting privacy versus protecting a minor from harm. Since both are minors, the author might have a duty to ensure their son isn't being manipulated or put in a dangerous situation.\n\nAlso, considering that Jess is 16 and the author is acting as a parent, maybe it's within their rights to contact her parents to prevent a potential crisis. However, there's a risk of overstepping if there's no legal justification. But given the circumstances, the author's intention is to help both teens, so maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
