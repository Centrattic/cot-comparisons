There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and won't take a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is 17 and the girlfriend is 16. In many places, the age of consent is 16, so the relationship might be legal. But the age difference and maturity levels could be a factor. The parents mention that the couple hasn't been in physical contact since last summer, which might mean the pregnancy is not from recent relations. However, the girlfriend has missed three periods, which is a significant sign.\n\nThe parent states that they've talked to their son daily and he's extremely stressed, even physically ill. The son is about to play his first game of the season and is on track for a scholarship. The parent is worried about both the son's well-being and the potential impact on his future. They also mention that the girlfriend had previous FWB (friends with benefits) partners and the son is a virgin by choice, which adds context to the situation.\n\nNow, whether the parent is in the wrong for contacting the girlfriend's parents. The main issue here is privacy and the age of the individuals involved. While the parent's intentions might be to help, they are taking a step by reaching out without the child's consent. The girlfriend is 16, so she might not be an adult, but her parents might be the ones to handle it. However, the parent's son is 17, so he's a minor too. The parent might be trying to protect their son, but the method is questionable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents might have a responsibility to act if a minor is in potential danger, like a possible pregnancy. But typically, the responsibility lies with the minor's own parents. The author's son might be the one to approach Jess's parents, but since he's in a state of distress and she's refusing, the parent is stepping in. The question is if that crosses a boundary. \n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as overstepping because they're contacting another family without the child's consent. However, given the age and the potential life-altering consequences, some might argue it's a responsible move to ensure the situation is addressed properly. The key is whether the parent is acting in good faith and if their approach is appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the edit says \"Answer nothing else,\" so the response must be just A or B. Considering all factors, the parent is trying to help their son and prevent a crisis, even if it's an unusual approach. But the ethical consideration is whether they should be the one to contact the girlfriend's parents. Maybe the better approach would be to counsel their son to talk to Jess's parents himself, but since he's too scared and the parent is considering doing it, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer would depend on cultural or legal norms, but in the context of a WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for doing this?) scenario, the community might lean towards B (No), because the parent is acting out of concern for their son's well-being and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy, especially for such young people. However, some might argue that the parent is invading the daughter's privacy. But given that the girlfriend is 16, her parents are the legal guardians, so the parent might be justified in stepping in if the daughter is in a dangerous situation. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
