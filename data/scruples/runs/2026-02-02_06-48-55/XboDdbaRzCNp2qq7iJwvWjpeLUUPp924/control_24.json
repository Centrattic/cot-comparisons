There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents. The girlfriend, Jess, is possibly pregnant but hasn't taken a test. The son, Sam, is 17 and a junior in high school with his future at stake. The parents are worried about the situation affecting his scholarship and well-being.\n\nFirst, the legal angle: In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, but if they had sexual contact when both were minors, it might still be legal. But if the pregnancy is a result of that, the parents might have a duty to inform the girl's parents if they suspect a problem. However, the parents are not the ones who have a direct responsibility here.\n\nMoral considerations: The parents are trying to protect their son's well-being. However, contacting the girl's parents without her consent might violate her privacy. The parents are doing this because Jess refuses to take a test, which is a significant issue. But is it their place to intervene? They are trying to prevent a potential crisis, but the method might be problematic.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the girl's autonomy. Even if she's 16, she has the right to make her own decisions, though she's a minor. The parents might not have the right to contact her parents without her knowledge, especially if they're not her legal guardians. However, given the potential pregnancy, some might argue it's a parental duty to step in to ensure the girl's health and safety.\n\nThe son's well-being is also a factor. He's suffering physically and emotionally. The parents are concerned about his future. But how does contacting the girl's parents help? It could escalate the situation or make the girl feel betrayed, leading to more problems.\n\nAnother point: The parents mention that the girl sent messages from the son to them before. They already intervened once. Now they're considering another step. There's a pattern here of parental involvement that might be overstepping, depending on the circumstances. If the girl's parents are involved, they might have their own views on the situation.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents can report potential issues to authorities, but contacting the girl's parents directly might not be the right approach. The appropriate step might be to talk to the girl's parents first if they're concerned about her health, especially if there's a possible pregnancy. However, since the parents are not the girl's legal guardians, they might need to involve authorities rather than the girl's parents.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: legal responsibilities, the girl's autonomy, the son's well-being, and the parents' intentions, it's a complex situation. The parents are trying to protect their son and prevent a crisis, but their method of contacting the girl's parents without her consent might be overstepping, especially if they don't have a legal basis to do so. They might be in the wrong for not respecting the girl's privacy and autonomy, even if their intentions are good.\n"
