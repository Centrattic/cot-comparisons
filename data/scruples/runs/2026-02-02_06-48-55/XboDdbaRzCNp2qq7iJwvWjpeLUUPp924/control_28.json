There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been in contact since last summer. The girlfriend, Jess, is missing periods and thinks she might be pregnant but refuses to take a test. The son is really stressed and considering breaking up, but also doesn't want to be dumped. The parent is thinking of reaching out to Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent: In most places in the US, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so both are above that. However, there might be state-specific laws, but generally, as long as they're both over 16, the relationship is legal. But since they haven't been in contact since last summer, the pregnancy is unlikely. Maybe the parent is trying to protect their son's future, especially since he's on track for a scholarship.\n\nEthically, the parent is trying to intervene to prevent a possible crisis. Jess is not taking responsibility by not taking a test, and the son is suffering from anxiety. The parent's concern is valid because the son's health is deteriorating. However, contacting the girlfriend's parents might infringe on Jess's privacy. Even though the parent has a valid reason, they might not have the right to reach out directly without consequences. It could lead to legal issues if the parent is seen as overstepping, or maybe Jess's parents would take action. The parent's intention is to help, but the method might be problematic. Also, the parent already dealt with Jess sending screenshots of Sam's messages, which suggests there's a history of conflict. The parent might be trying to protect their son, but the approach could backfire. The correct approach might be to encourage Jess to take a test, involve her parents through her if possible, or perhaps seek legal advice. So, the parent's action could be wrong because they're bypassing Jess and directly contacting her parents, which might not be the best approach despite good intentions.\n"
