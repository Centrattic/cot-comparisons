There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, might be pregnant but won't take a test. The son, Sam, is 17, and Jess just turned 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, and the relationship is only a couple of months old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 16 is the minimum in many states. So if both are of legal age, that's a check. However, the parent is planning to contact Jess's parents without her consent. Privacy is a big issue here. Jess might be a minor, so her parents have some rights, but the parent is stepping in without involving the parents yet. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Sam is really stressed and physically unwell. The parent is concerned about his well-being, which is understandable. But the parent's approach could be problematic. Sam's actions (telling Jess he'll talk to her parents if she doesn't take a test) might be seen as overstepping, but the parent is following through on that threat. \n\nThe parent mentions that Jess has a history of scare tactics with other partners. That could be a red flag, but it's important not to assume her intentions. The parent is trying to protect their son, which is a natural instinct. However, contacting another minor's parents without their consent might not be the right approach. It could cause more harm, like a privacy violation or escalating the conflict between the teens.\n\nAlso, the parent is taking a proactive role, but maybe they should involve their own son's healthcare or school first. Or maybe encourage communication between Sam and Jess without involving external parties. There's also the matter of Sam's maturity. He's a junior, on track for a scholarship, dealing with a lot here, which is a valid concern.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping. While their intentions are good, the method of contacting Jess's parents without her consent might not be the best approach. It could lead to legal issues if the parent is not a legal guardian of Jess, and it invades Jess's privacy. The parent should probably consult with their son's school counselor or a healthcare provider first, or work with their own son to find a solution that respects everyone's boundaries.\n"
