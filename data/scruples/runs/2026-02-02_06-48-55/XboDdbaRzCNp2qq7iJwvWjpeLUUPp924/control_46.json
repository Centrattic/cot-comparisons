There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the mother (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting her son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend refuses to take a pregnancy test. \n\nFirst, the son is 17, and the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically together since last summer, and the relationship is only two months old. The mother is worried because her son is extremely stressed, even getting physically ill, and the girlfriend is avoiding getting a test. The mother mentions that her son might contact the girlfriend's parents if she doesn't take a test within a week.\n\nNow, considering the ages involved, both are minors. In many places, parents have a legal right to be involved in their minor child's health matters, especially regarding pregnancy. The girlfriend's parents might have a duty to care for her health. However, the mother is not the girlfriend's parent, so she's stepping into a role that might not be her place. She's acting on her son's behalf, but the girlfriend has a right to privacy and autonomy, even as a minor. \n\nThe mother's concern is valid because her son is suffering, but taking the step to contact another's parents without consent could overstep. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy is violated, and the mother could be seen as interfering in a way that's not her responsibility. There's also the emotional aspect\u2014forcing the girlfriend's parents into the situation might not help, especially if the girlfriend is already reluctant to talk to them. \n\nAdditionally, the mother's son is being pressured to break up, and the mother is using the threat of contacting her parents as leverage. This could be manipulative or coercive, depending on how it's handled. The situation is complex, but the mother's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, there's a line she's crossing into another family's affairs without their consent. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether contacting another's parents is an appropriate step. Since the author isn't the girlfriend's parent, doing so might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But I should double-check if there are any legal considerations. In some jurisdictions, parents might have a duty to report if a minor is in a risky situation, but that's more about child welfare than privacy. Still, the mother isn't the girlfriend's parent, so she might not have that legal standing. So, ethically, it's a no-go. Answer A.\n"
