At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to contact their son's girlfriend's parents because she might be pregnant and won't take a test. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son is 17 and the girlfriend just turned 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so the pregnancy might not even be his. The relationship is only two months old. Jess is avoiding her parents and not taking a pregnancy test. My son, Sam, is really stressed, physically ill, and considering breaking up with her. There's some history where Sam was acting poorly, and Jess sent screenshots to the author. Now the author is thinking about stepping in by contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nThe key points here are the ages of the kids, the potential pregnancy, and the author's intervention. Since Jess is 16 and Sam is 17, they are both minors. In many places, minors are supposed to be under the care of their parents, so maybe the author has a right to be concerned. However, the author is not Jess's parent, so they might overstepping. But given that Jess is avoiding her own parents, maybe the author has a valid reason to want to involve them to protect both kids.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of Sam's health. He's so stressed he's vomiting and has other physical symptoms. This seems really serious. The author's intention is to help both teenagers deal with the situation, especially since they are both still in high school and have futures to consider, like Sam's scholarship. The author might be trying to prevent a bigger problem if Jess is indeed pregnant, which could affect both their lives.\n\nBut is it the author's place to contact Jess's parents? Normally, parents are responsible for their children, so Jess's parents should be the ones to handle this. However, Jess isn't talking to them. If the author has a good relationship with Jess's parents or a reason to believe they need to be involved, maybe it's justified. However, if the author is stepping in without prior involvement or consent, that could be problematic. \n\nThere's also the part where Sam was an asshole to Jess earlier, and she sent evidence to the author. The author dealt with it, so maybe they have some prior involvement in their relationship. This might give the author a bit more justification in stepping in now.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. Jess has the right to privacy, but the author is a parent concerned about their son's well-being and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy. Balancing these rights is tricky. If Sam is a minor, his parent might have a duty to ensure his safety and health, which could include getting Jess to take a test. But the author is doing it by contacting Jess's parents, which could be seen as overreaching.\n\nLegal considerations: Depending on the state or country, there might be laws about parental notification for minors in such situations. If Jess is a minor and the author is another parent, they might have a legal obligation to inform, especially if there's a possibility of pregnancy. However, if the kids are both minors, maybe the author should involve their own child's school or authorities first.\n\nEthically, parents typically want to protect their children, but the method of doing so matters. The author is trying to help Sam and Jess, but the approach could be seen as intrusive. Jess's parents need to be involved because it's their responsibility to their daughter, even if she's being scared. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention is to ensure Jess's well-being and Sam's future, but the way they do it could affect the outcome.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jess has had other FWB partners and this isn't her first scare might mean she's not taking her actions seriously, which could justify the author's concern. Sam is still a virgin by choice, which shows he's trying to be responsible, but the situation is out of his control now.\n\nIn the end, the author's action is to contact Jess's parents to get her to take a test, which could either help resolve the issue or damage the relationship between the families. The main question is whether the author is overstepping by contacting Jess's parents when Sam is the one who should handle it with her, unless there's a legal or medical necessity. However, given the minors' ages and the severity of the situation, the author might be trying to fulfill a parental duty to protect their son and involve the appropriate parties. So the answer could be B (No), but I need to consider if there's a better path. Maybe the author should first talk to Jess directly, but since she's not cooperating, contacting her parents might be the next step. Legally, minors might require parental involvement in healthcare decisions, so the author's action could be in line with that. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
