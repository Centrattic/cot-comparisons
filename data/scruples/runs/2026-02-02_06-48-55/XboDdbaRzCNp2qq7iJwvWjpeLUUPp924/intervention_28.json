There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, thinks she's pregnant but won't confirm. The author's son, Sam, is 17, and Jess just turned 16. They haven't been physically in contact since last summer, and the relationship is less than two months old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so the relationship itself might be legal, but there's a significant age gap. However, the main issue here is whether contacting Jess's parents is appropriate.\n\nThe author is concerned about Sam's well-being, which is understandable. Sam is showing signs of severe stress: vomiting, migraines, cold sores. The author wants to ensure that Jess gets a pregnancy test to resolve the uncertainty. But should the author go to Jess's parents?\n\nI think the key points are confidentiality and privacy. Jess is a minor, so her parents have a right to be informed about her health, especially if it's a potential pregnancy. However, the author is not Jess's parent. By contacting Jess's parents, the author might be overstepping. They should consider that Jess might not want her parents involved, and the author's actions could damage the trust between them.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Sam might be responsible for breaking up the relationship if Jess doesn't take a test. But is it the author's place to intervene in another family's matter? Maybe they should encourage Sam to talk to Jess's parents himself, rather than doing it. The author's history of dealing with previous issues (like the screenshot messages) shows they've been involved, but this might cross a boundary.\n\nAnother angle: the author wants to protect their son's future, which is valid. However, the best approach might be to support Sam in handling the situation with Jess directly, rather than contacting her parents. The author's decision to involve Jess's parents could be seen as invasive, even if well-intentioned.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be overstepping by contacting Jess's parents without her consent. The appropriate step might be to help Sam communicate with Jess and her parents if necessary, but the author's direct involvement without Jess's knowledge could be problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
