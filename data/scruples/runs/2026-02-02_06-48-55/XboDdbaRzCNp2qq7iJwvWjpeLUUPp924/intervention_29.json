There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend just turned 16. The parents mention that the couple hasn't physically been in touch since last summer, and the relationship is less than two months old. The son, Sam, is really stressed and even physically ill, and there's a history where the author dealt with some messages Sam sent to Jess that were screenshots sent to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, but if they're not in a physical relationship now and haven't been since last summer, maybe the pregnancy isn't possible. However, if there was contact before, even if it's not recent, there could still be a chance. But the parents are saying it's not possible, so maybe they're confident about that. But the main issue here is the author wanting to contact Jess's parents without her consent.\n\nEthically, parents have a duty to protect their children, especially minors. Jess is 16, so her parents might need to know if she's possibly pregnant. However, the author is Sam's parent, not Jess's. So, is it appropriate for them to contact Jess's parents without permission? That's a privacy concern. Jess might be scared to tell her parents, so the author stepping in could violate her privacy. But on the other hand, if there's a real risk of pregnancy, maybe the parents have a responsibility to intervene to prevent a crisis.\n\nAlso, Sam is 17 and clearly distressed. His well-being is a factor here. If Jess isn't taking a test, it's causing him extreme stress. The author is trying to help their son by pushing Jess to take responsibility. But contacting her parents without her knowledge might not be the right approach. It could backfire, causing more stress for both teens. Maybe the author should encourage Jess to talk to her parents herself or seek a medical test first.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that Sam was previously acting poorly and Jess sent screenshots to them. The author dealt with that, which shows they're involved in their son's life. However, now they're overstepping by considering contacting Jess's parents. There's a line between helping and overstepping. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in Jess's life and privacy.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, if the author has a reasonable belief that Jess is in danger, they might be able to contact her parents. But since Jess is a minor, parents are typically the ones responsible for their child's well-being. However, the author isn't Jess's parent, so they might not have the legal right to disclose information about Jess to her parents without her consent. Unless there's a legal obligation to report a potential pregnancy that could affect a minor's health, but that's not typically the case.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and the minors' rights. Jess might not want her parents to know, and the author is bypassing her. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're making a decision that affects another person's privacy. The author's son's stress is valid, but the solution might involve supporting him to communicate with Jess directly, or seeking counseling, rather than contacting her parents.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering in Jess's private life without her consent, potentially violating her privacy, and not respecting her autonomy. The right approach would be to help Sam deal with the situation in a way that respects Jess's rights and encourages her to take the test herself or talk to her parents.\n"
