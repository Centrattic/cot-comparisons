There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting the girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant and not taking a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been physically intimate since last summer. The situation seems pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is that Jess isn't taking responsibility for the situation. She's missed three periods and is avoiding her parents. The son, Sam, is really stressed, even physically ill, and the author is worried about their futures since he's on track for a scholarship. The author wants to step in after the week ends if Jess still hasn't taken a test.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects here. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so if they had relations before, maybe it's within legal age. But since they haven't been in touch since last summer, maybe there's no recent activity. However, the pregnancy scare is causing a lot of stress. The author is trying to protect their son and ensure Jess takes responsibility.\n\nBut does the author have the right to contact Jess's parents without her consent? It's a privacy issue. Jess might be a minor, so her parents have some rights. But the author isn't Jess's parent, so maybe overstepping? However, given the minor age and the potential for a false pregnancy scare, the author could be trying to prevent a crisis.\n\nSam is 17 and old enough to be concerned, but he's still a minor. The author is acting as a parent to protect their son. However, contacting another family's parents without their knowledge could be seen as meddling. But the situation is urgent, affecting both teens' lives, especially the scholarship.\n\nThe author mentions that Sam had previously acted poorly towards Jess, which might have caused tension. The author dealt with that before. Now, Jess is holding onto messages, which could indicate she's feeling wronged. The author's intervention might be seen as trying to resolve a situation that's between the two teens and their parents.\n\nBut since the author is a parent, maybe they have a duty to protect their son's well-being. However, contacting Jess's parents could be seen as violating her privacy. On the other hand, if Jess is a minor, her parents have a right to be involved in her health decisions. The author might be trying to force Jess to take responsibility, which could be justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe key points are the minors' ages, the author's intent to protect their son, and the potential consequences for both teens. The author's actions might be in the right to prevent a possible crisis, but there's a line between helping and overstepping. It's a tricky situation where the answer isn't clear, but given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because their intentions are to protect their son and ensure a responsible outcome.\n"
