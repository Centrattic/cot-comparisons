There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because she might be pregnant and won't take a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend just turned 16. They haven't been in physical contact since last summer, which is over a year ago. The relationship is only two months old.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age and any potential issues there. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but typically it's 16 or 18. If the girlfriend is 16 and the son is 17, depending on the state, they might be within the age of consent, but some states have close-in-age exemptions. However, the main point here is the pregnancy situation.\n\nThe parents are concerned about their son's well-being. He's physically ill, vomiting, headaches, sleeping a lot, and even a cold sore. They've been talking a lot, and he's torn between staying in the relationship or breaking up. The mother is considering contacting Jess's parents because she hasn't taken a test yet, and she's missed three periods. The mother also mentions that the son was previously acting badly towards Jess, which led to a fallout where Jess sent screenshots to her. The mother dealt with that, but now there's this new issue.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is the mother right to contact Jess's parents? Let me think. The son is a minor, and if Jess is also a minor, both are under 18. The mother's intent is to get Jess to take a pregnancy test to confirm. But Jess's parents might not be aware of the situation. However, the mother's son is a junior in high school with a full scholarship on the line for baseball. An unplanned pregnancy at 16 could be a big deal for both teens, but Jess is the one who is possibly pregnant.\n\nThe mother's son is still a virgin by choice, which suggests he might not have had sexual contact recently, which aligns with the time frame since they last met. But the girlfriend is missing periods and thinks she's pregnant. The mother is trying to help her son, but she's stepping over boundaries by involving Jess's parents without their knowledge.\n\nIn some cases, if a minor is in a situation that could affect their health or future, parents might have a right to intervene. However, contacting Jess's parents might be seen as overstepping because it's Jess's own health issue. The mother might be trying to protect her son, but she should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In some places, minors can get medical care confidentially, so Jess might have access to a test without her parents. Also, breaking up could be an option, but the son is afraid of the reaction.\n\nThe mother's previous action of dealing with her son's bad behavior towards Jess might indicate that she's already involved in their relationship. Now, she's considering contacting Jess's parents to force a test. While her concern is valid, the approach might be wrong. It's Jess's responsibility to address her own potential pregnancy. The mother should focus on supporting her son and ensuring he's getting the help he needs, rather than taking matters into her own hands. She could talk to her son about possible steps he can take with Jess, like encouraging her to go to a clinic where she can get a test and possibly medical advice confidentially. But contacting her parents could be invasive and might not be the right approach unless there's a legal requirement to report such a situation, which I don't think there is in this case. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong by considering contacting Jess's parents without their consent, as it's an invasion of privacy. The correct answer would be A.\n"
