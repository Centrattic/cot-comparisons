There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 17-year-old son named Sam and his 16-year-old girlfriend Jess. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but isn't taking a test, and Sam is really stressed out. The parent, the author, is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take the test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Both kids are minors, so their parents are legally responsible. However, in some places, the age of consent for pregnancy-related decisions might be different. But generally, parents have a right to be involved in their child's health, especially regarding pregnancy.\n\nThe author's son, Sam, is experiencing severe stress and physical symptoms. The parent is worried about his well-being and the potential impact on his future, like a baseball scholarship. The parent is trying to protect Sam, which is understandable. However, the parent is considering contacting Jess's parents, which might not be Jess's choice. Jess might feel that her privacy is being invaded, and her parents might react strongly. But since she's 16, her parents are her legal guardians, so the author's action could be seen as necessary to prevent harm.\n\nAnother point is that Jess has a history of \"fwb partners,\" and Sam is a virgin who doesn't want unplanned pregnancy. This situation is complex. The author is trying to resolve the uncertainty, which could prevent worse consequences. However, there's a balance between respecting Jess's autonomy and protecting Sam's health and future.\n\nLegally, since both are minors, the parent might have a right to involve the other parent. Ethically, it's about whether the parent is overstepping. But given the severity of Sam's condition and the potential pregnancy, the parent's actions could be justified as a protective measure. The key is whether contacting Jess's parents is the responsible step to get the truth out and address the situation before it escalates more.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in their son's best interest and trying to resolve a serious situation that could affect both teenagers' futures.\n"
