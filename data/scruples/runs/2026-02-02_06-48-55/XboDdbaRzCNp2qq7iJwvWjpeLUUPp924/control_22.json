There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, might be pregnant but refuses to take a test. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, so the pregnancy is unlikely. But Jess has missed 3 periods and is scared. The son is really stressed, physically unwell, and they're in a new relationship. The parent wants to contact Jess's mom if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nI should consider legal aspects. Both are minors. In some places, parents might have a responsibility to involve authorities if there's a pregnancy, especially if the girl isn't getting help. But since they haven't been in contact recently, maybe there's another reason for the missed periods. Jess might be lying or there's another health issue. \n\nThe parent's intention is to help, but contacting the girlfriend's parents without her consent could be seen as overstepping. However, the son is suffering, and the parent is trying to protect both kids. Also, the son is about to play a big game, and stress might affect that. \n\nThere's a past issue where the son sent messages that were problematic, but the parent already addressed that. Now, the main issue is the possible pregnancy. If Jess is underage and pregnant, maybe there's a legal requirement to report. But since the pregnancy is unlikely, maybe the parent is acting on a false alarm. \n\nEthically, is it right for the parent to contact Jess's parents without her consent? The parent's goal is to get Jess to take a test, which is important for both teens. However, it's a privacy issue. The parent might be protecting their son, but it's also about Jess's autonomy. \n\nIn some places, if a parent suspects a minor is pregnant and the minor isn't seeking help, the parent might have a duty to report it. But here, the parent is not reporting to authorities but to the minor's parents. That could be okay if the intention is to get support for Jess. \n\nBut since the parent is not Jess's parent, they might not have the right to involve her parents without her consent. However, given the circumstances\u2014son's well-being, possible false claims, and the teens' futures\u2014it's a tough call. \n\nI think the parent is trying to prevent a crisis by ensuring Jess gets tested. If Jess is lying about being pregnant to manipulate or if there's an actual pregnancy that needs to be addressed, the parent's action could be justified. But without knowing the truth, contacting the parents might be seen as overreaching. However, given the son's suffering and the potential risks, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
