There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend (Jess) might be pregnant but won't take a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16. They haven't been in contact since last summer, so the baby can't be his. The son is really stressed, physically ill, and they're both supposed to have their futures ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so if they were in a relationship last summer and haven't been in touch since, maybe there's no legal issue there. But the main issue is the parent wanting to contact the girlfriend's parents without her consent. \n\nThe parents might be worried about their son's well-being, given his physical symptoms. But is it their place to contact another family without the child's permission? Usually, parents have the right to be concerned about their child's welfare, but when it comes to another person's child, especially a minor, there's a line. However, since both are minors, the parents might feel more justified in stepping in. \n\nJess is refusing to take a pregnancy test and not talking to her parents. The son is pressuring her to take action, and when she doesn't, he's considering his mom to contact her parents. The mother is considering this action after a week of no test. \n\nIn terms of privacy, contacting another parent without the child's consent could be seen as overstepping. However, the situation involves potential pregnancy, which is a serious matter. The mother might believe she's acting in her son's best interest, but also possibly in Jess's. But Jess's parents are the ones who are legally responsible for her, so if there's a medical issue, they should be involved. \n\nAlso, the son was previously acting poorly towards his girlfriend, which the mother dealt with. That might affect the dynamics here. The mother might feel like she's not just protecting her son but also addressing past issues. \n\nThe key points are the son's distress, the potential pregnancy, and the mother's actions. If the mother contacts Jess's parents without her son's consent or Jess's consent, is that ethical? It depends on the jurisdiction, but generally, parents have some responsibility to protect their children and others. However, inserting into another family's affairs without consent might be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mother is trying to resolve a situation that's causing harm to her son and potentially to the other girl, she might be acting from a place of concern. But without knowing the legal boundaries, it's tricky. However, in many places, parents can contact each other's parents if they have a legitimate concern for their child's well-being, especially involving minors. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's acting in her son's and the other girl's interests, even if it's without consent. But some might argue she's overstepping. It's a balance between privacy and well-being.\n"
