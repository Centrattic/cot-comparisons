There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's girlfriend's parents because she might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been physically together since last summer. The parents are worried about their son's well-being\u2014he's physically ill, anxious, and it's affecting his school and sports.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: in the US, the age of consent varies by state, but 16 is generally okay for consenting relationships. However, the parents are worried about a potential pregnancy even though they know there's no way the baby could be theirs. Wait, the parent says they haven't been in touch since last summer. But the girlfriend has missed three periods, so maybe the pregnancy is from someone else? That's a point to consider. \n\nThe parent's main concern is their son's health. He's vomiting, has a migraine, and is emotionally distressed. They've tried talking to him, but he's stuck in a cycle of anxiety. The girlfriend is avoiding her parents and not taking a test. The parent is considering stepping in to prevent a crisis.\n\nBut is it their place to contact the girlfriend's parents? The parents might be overstepping, but their intent is to protect their son. However, the girlfriend is a minor, so her parents have a right to know if there's a medical issue affecting their daughter. The parent is trying to get her to take responsibility, which could be a valid approach. \n\nHowever, the parent might not have the authority to make that call. The girlfriend's privacy and autonomy are also factors. The parents could be infringing on her rights by contacting her parents without her consent. But since she's a minor, her parents are legally responsible for her health decisions. \n\nThe key here is the parent's intent versus the method. If the goal is to get the girlfriend to take a test to resolve the situation and protect both teens, maybe they're justified. But contacting the parents might be seen as a violation of privacy. Alternatively, the parent could be helping to ensure the girl gets medical attention, which is a parental duty if they believe there's a health risk.\n\nAlso, the son is 17, so he's almost an adult. The parents might be trying to help him take responsibility. But the girlfriend's parents should be involved because she's a minor. It's a tricky situation. The parent might not be in the wrong because their actions are driven by concern for their son's well-being and the potential medical issue, even if it's a heavy-handed approach.\n\nBut legally and ethically, is there a right or wrong? The answer might depend on the jurisdiction. However, in terms of social norms, some might say the parent is justified given the circumstances, while others might think they should have let the teens handle it. Considering the son's health and the girlfriend's refusal to act, the parent's intervention could be seen as necessary. So the answer might be B (no, not in the wrong). But need to check if the parent has the right to do so without the teens' consent. If the parent is acting to protect their son and the girl's health, maybe it's justified. However, the parent might be overstepping by contacting her parents without her consent. But since the girl is a minor, her parents should be involved in her medical decisions. So the parent's action could be appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
