There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the parent of Sam, the 17-year-old) is in the wrong if they contact Jess's parents because she might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and ages here. Both Sam and Jess are minors\u201417 and 16 respectively. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, depending on the state or country. If they had a consensual relationship before the summer, but haven't been in contact since then, there's a possibility that the pregnancy could be from someone else. The parent mentions that they haven't been in physical contact since last summer, so if Jess is pregnant, it might be from someone else. \n\nThe parent is concerned about their son's well-being. He's physically ill, anxious, and the situation is affecting his health and future, especially with a baseball scholarship. The parent wants Jess to take a test, but she's refusing. The parent is considering contacting Jess's parents to intervene because Jess isn't taking responsibility.\n\nBut is the parent overstepping? Jess is a minor, so her parents are responsible for her welfare. However, contacting her parents without her consent could be seen as violating Jess's privacy. But since she's a minor, maybe the parents have a right to step in, especially if there's a potential pregnancy. The parent's action could be justified as trying to protect their son and ensure that Jess takes responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is bypassing Jess's parents without maybe considering how Jess would react. If Jess's parents find out through the other parent instead of Jess, that could cause problems. Also, the parent's son is 17, which is still a minor in most places, so maybe both sets of parents have a role here. \n\nThe parent also mentions that Jess had previous FWB partners, which complicates things. The parent might be trying to prevent an unnecessary breakup that could affect her as well. However, the parent's main concern is their son's health and future. \n\nI think the key points are: Jess is a minor, the potential pregnancy could be from someone else, and the parent is trying to get her to take responsibility to protect their son. Since the parent's son is also a minor, maybe the appropriate step would be to involve both parents. However, the parent is taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if a minor is pregnant, the parents can be involved. So the parent contacting Jess's parents might not be wrong because they're trying to resolve the situation. The alternative is that Jess isn't taking responsibility, and the parent is trying to prevent a crisis. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting Jess's privacy. However, since she's a minor and the parent is acting in their son's best interest, maybe it's justified. The parent might not be in the wrong here.\n"
