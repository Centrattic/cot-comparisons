There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for considering contacting their son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because she might be pregnant and isn't taking a test. \n\nFirst, the son is 17, the girlfriend just turned 16. They haven't been in physical contact since last summer, so the pregnancy can't be his. The girlfriend, Jess, has missed three periods, but won't take a test. The son, Sam, is very distressed, physically unwell, and considering breaking up. The parent is thinking of contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so if they had a relationship before, maybe they're within legal boundaries. But Jess is only 16 now, and depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about the age difference. However, the user says they haven't been in contact recently, so maybe the pregnancy isn't a result of their relationship. \n\nThe parent's concern is for their son's well-being. Sam is suffering, both emotionally and physically. The parent wants to ensure Jess gets a pregnancy test to resolve the uncertainty. But contacting Jess's parents could be seen as overstepping. Jess is 16, a minor, so her parents might have a right to be involved in her health decisions. However, the parent is not Jess's legal guardian, so approaching her parents without consent might breach privacy. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that Sam was previously unkind to Jess, which was handled. There's a history there that might complicate things. The parent's intention is to protect their son, but the method might be crossing a line. Jess has the right to make her own decisions, even if she's a minor, unless she's in danger. Since there's no immediate danger, but a health concern (possible pregnancy), the parent's action could be justified as trying to get medical attention for Jess. However, the parent isn't the one responsible for Jess; that's her parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's son is 17, almost an adult, and maybe he should handle it himself. The parent stepping in might not be appropriate unless there's a legal obligation or duty. So, the answer hinges on whether the parent has the right to contact Jess's parents without her consent. If the parent's actions are to ensure Jess gets a test for her own health, it might be justified. But if it's to protect their son's feelings, it's more about the parent overstepping. \n\nGiven that Jess is a minor, her parents should be involved in her healthcare decisions. The parent's action might be in line with ensuring her health, thus not being in the wrong. However, the parent isn't Jess's guardian, so there's a privacy issue. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the intent is to help Jess's health, but A (in the wrong) if it's about controlling the situation without consent. The key is the parent's justification. Since the parent is trying to resolve a possible health issue for Jess and her well-being, maybe it's not wrong. But legally and ethically, it's a gray area. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
