There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's son is 17, and his girlfriend is 16. She's not in touch with her parents and refuses to take a pregnancy test. The author is considering contacting her parents if she doesn't get tested by the end of the week. \n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent for parental notification regarding a minor's medical issues is important. Since Jess is 16, which is under 18, the parents might have some rights. But depending on the jurisdiction, there might be exceptions for pregnancy-related matters. However, the author isn't Jess's parent, so their right to intervene could be questionable. \n\nEthically, the author's son is clearly distressed. He's physically unwell, which is serious. The author is trying to help their son, which is understandable. But contacting another person's parents without their consent might be seen as overstepping. Even if the author has the son's best interest in mind, they might be violating Jess's privacy. \n\nAlso, Jess is a minor, so her parents might have a responsibility to get involved if their daughter is refusing medical care. But the author isn't Jess's parent. There could be legal repercussions if the author contacts Jess's parents without a legal basis. \n\nAnother angle: the author's son is an adult in some states (if they're 18), but here he's 17, so still a minor. Both are minors, which complicates things. The author is a parent, so they might have a duty to protect their son's well-being. However, contacting another's parents could be considered interference unless there's an emergency. \n\nThe author mentions that the girl had previous scare pregnancies and FWB partners, which adds context. But that doesn't justify the author contacting her parents. It's possible that the author is trying to force a situation that should be handled by Jess's own parents. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should involve child protective services or a medical professional if there's a risk. But directly contacting Jess's parents might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, legally and ethically, the author might be in the wrong because they're not Jess's legal guardian and shouldn't be making decisions about her medical care. The correct course of action might be to encourage their son to talk to a professional or involve authorities if there's a health risk.\n"
