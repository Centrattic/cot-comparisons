There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 17-year-old son, Sam, is in a relationship with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Jess. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test or talk to her parents. Sam is really stressed and even physically ill because of this. The author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both Sam and Jess are minors. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about parental involvement in cases of potential pregnancy. In some places, parents have the right to know if their minor child is pregnant, especially if there's a risk to the child's health or well-being. Since Jess is 16 and a half, maybe the author as a parent of the boyfriend has some standing here? Not sure. But I think the key point is Jess's age and her parents' rights.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. Sam is clearly distressed, which is understandable given his age and his future plans (like the baseball scholarship). Jess not taking responsibility by not taking a test could lead to bigger problems. But is it the author's place to intervene? Jess's parents are the ones who have a legal and ethical responsibility towards her. By contacting them, the author is trying to prevent a possible crisis. However, there's a privacy issue here. Jess might see this as an invasion of her privacy, even if she's a minor. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Sam was previously \"behaving like an asshole\" to Jess, which led to some messages being sent to the author. That suggests there might be some history of conflict between the families or between the teens themselves. Maybe the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're trying to influence Jess's decisions directly. However, given the high stakes and Sam's well-being, the author's concern is valid.\n\nAnother point is that Jess has a history of \"fwb partners\" (friends with benefits), which might indicate she's not in the best place for a stable relationship, especially at her age. The author might think that breaking up is the right choice for both teens, but it's also possible that Jess's refusal to take a test is a sign of deeper issues. \n\nLegally, the author might not have the right to contact Jess's parents without her consent, but since both are minors, perhaps there's a gray area. In some states, if a minor is at risk of harm, a parent can report it to authorities, but contacting the other parent directly might not be the standard procedure. The author is probably trying to protect their son, but it's a delicate situation.\n\nIn terms of the well-being of both teens, if Jess is actually pregnant, it could derail both their futures. The author's intervention might be necessary even if it's a bit direct. However, there's a risk of overstepping, especially if Jess's parents don't appreciate being contacted by another parent. But given the circumstances, maybe the author is justified in trying to prevent a situation that could cause lasting harm.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because the intent is to protect their son and prevent a potential crisis. However, the method (contacting Jess's parents) might have been better handled through the school or a healthcare provider first. But given the urgency and the teens' ages, maybe it's a reasonable step. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
