There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to contact their son's girlfriend's parents because she's possibly pregnant and won't take a test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The son is 17, the girlfriend is 16, and they haven't been physically together since last summer. The relationship is only two months old. The girl has missed three periods and won't take a test. The son is really stressed, physically ill, and they both have their futures at stake. The author is considering contacting the girl's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's son is under 18, as is the girlfriend. Both are minors. The parents are stepping in because their son is suffering and the situation is causing him severe stress. The girl isn't communicating with her parents and is refusing to take a test. The author is worried about their son's well-being and future, especially since he's on track for a sports scholarship.\n\nBut wait, the author is considering contacting the girl's parents without her consent. Is that appropriate? In some places, parents might have legal rights to intervene if their child is in a situation that could lead to pregnancy, especially if the child is a minor. However, there's also the issue of privacy and the girl's right to make her own decisions, even if she's not handling things well.\n\nThe son is already trying to talk to her, but she's not cooperating. The author is trying to protect their son, which is a common parental instinct. However, contacting another child's parents without their consent might be seen as overstepping, unless there's a legal or emergency situation. \n\nThe author mentions that the girl had sent messages to them about their son's bad behavior. Maybe there's a history of conflict here. But the current issue is about the pregnancy scare. \n\nEthically, the parents are concerned for their son's health and future. But legally, they might not have the right to contact the girl's parents unless there's a specific legal authority. In some jurisdictions, parents can get involved if they believe their child is in a harmful situation, but the line is blurry here. \n\nAlso, the girl's refusal to take a test could be due to fear or other reasons. The parents might be trying to help by pushing for clarity. But is it their place to contact the girl's parents? It could be seen as violating the girl's privacy and autonomy, even if well-intended.\n\nThe situation is complex. The parents are trying to protect their son, but the approach might not be the best. Maybe there's a better way, like involving a healthcare professional or a counselor. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is contacting the parents, it could be considered wrong because it's an invasion of the girl's privacy and might not follow proper procedures. Alternatively, if the parents are trying to resolve their son's distress, maybe it's understandable.\n\nI think the answer is a balance. But according to legal and ethical standards, contacting another parent without consent might be overstepping. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
