There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old boy, Sam, and his girlfriend Jess, who is 16. Jess thinks she might be pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really stressed and even physically ill because of it. The parent, the author, is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test by the end of the week. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the ages. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 17, so a 16-17 relationship is legal. But the author is a parent, so they have a responsibility to their son. Sam is clearly in a lot of distress, and the parent is trying to help him. The problem is that Jess isn't communicating with her parents, and there's a potential pregnancy.\n\nThe author's main concern is about their son's well-being. Sam is breaking down physically because he's scared of the implications of a pregnancy. The parent is worried about his future, especially since he's on track for a scholarship. The parent is considering stepping in directly by contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't take a test. \n\nBut wait, what about privacy? Jess is 16, so she's a minor. In some jurisdictions, minors can have confidential medical care, including pregnancy tests. If the parent contacts Jess's parents without her consent, that might be a violation of her privacy. However, if there's a real risk of pregnancy and the parent is acting in their son's best interest, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that Sam told Jess he'd talk to her mom if she didn't take a test. Now the parent is considering doing it themselves. But Sam is 17, so he's almost an adult. The parent might be overstepping by contacting Jess's parents without consulting Sam first, especially if Sam is supposed to handle it himself. However, if the parent is doing it to protect their son from harm, that's a different angle.\n\nAnother point: the parent is aware of past issues where Sam was behaving badly towards Jess, but that's already been addressed. Now the parent is trying to prevent a potential pregnancy. The parent might not be in the wrong because they're trying to help their son. But is it right to contact another minor's parents without their consent? It could be seen as meddling, but the parent's intent is to resolve a serious issue.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) question, the answer depends on the jurisdiction and social norms. But generally, if the parent is acting out of concern for their son's health and future, and the situation is urgent (possible pregnancy), some might say it's justified. Others might think it's an invasion of privacy. However, since the parent is a legal guardian and the situation involves their child's well-being, it's a tricky balance. The parent might not be in the wrong because they're trying to help their son, even if the approach is a bit heavy-handed. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
