He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe question is whether it's wrong for the author (a parent) to contact her son's 16-year-old girlfriend's parents because the girlfriend, Jess, thinks she's pregnant but refuses to take a test. The son, Sam, is 17 and a junior in high school, on track for a baseball scholarship. They haven't been physically in touch since last summer, and the relationship is only two months old. Sam is really stressed, physically unwell, and considering breaking up if Jess doesn't take the test. The parent is considering contacting Jess's mom if she doesn't take the test by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical implications. Both teens are minors, so their parents have some responsibility. However, the parent's role in this situation is a bit tricky. Jess is 16, and while she might be pregnant, she's refusing to take a test. The parent is thinking about contacting her parents because they're worried about their son's well-being and the potential consequences of an unplanned pregnancy affecting both teens' futures.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parent might have a right to be concerned, especially if there's a possibility of their son being a father. However, since the last physical contact was months ago, maybe the baby isn't his. Still, there's a need for Jess to take responsibility. The parent is trying to get Jess to take a test to resolve the uncertainty, which is causing their son significant stress.\n\nEthically, the parent's intention is to help their son and ensure that Jess takes responsibility. However, contacting the other parent without the child's consent could be seen as overstepping. Teens have some privacy rights, even if they're minors. The parent might be justified in their concern given the situation's impact on their son's health and future. On the other hand, involving Jess's parents could be seen as a breach of trust or as an intrusion into Jess's life.\n\nAlso, the parent has already dealt with a previous issue where Sam sent messages that were inappropriate, and they addressed it with their son. Now, they're concerned about the potential pregnancy and the stress it's causing Sam. They might feel that their son's well-being is at stake, so they're considering taking action to protect him.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong for contacting Jess's parents? It depends on the circumstances. If the parent's goal is to encourage Jess to take a test and get clarity, perhaps it's a way to help both teens. However, the parent might be acting without fully considering Jess's autonomy. On the other hand, since both are minors, their parents are responsible for their children's welfare, so perhaps the parent isn't in the wrong.\n\nI need to weigh the parent's intent against the method. The parent is trying to resolve a stressful situation for their son, who is already suffering from anxiety. Contacting Jess's parents could push Jess to take action, which might be the only way to get the truth. But it's also possible that this action could make Jess more resistant or cause tension between the families.\n\nIn some cases, parents might be expected to step in when their child is in a stressful situation that affects their health. The parent's action might be seen as overstepping, but given the context, it could be a necessary step to prevent potential long-term consequences for both teens.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong. Their action is motivated by concern for their son's well-being and the potential impact of an unplanned pregnancy. However, it's a close call. The answer would depend on cultural or personal views on parental intervention in teenagers' relationships.\n"
