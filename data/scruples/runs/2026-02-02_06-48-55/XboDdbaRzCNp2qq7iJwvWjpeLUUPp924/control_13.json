There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 17-year-old son, Sam, and his 16-year-old girlfriend, Jess. Jess thinks she's pregnant but won't take a test. Sam is really stressed about it, and the author is considering contacting Jess's parents if she doesn't get tested by the end of the week.\n\nFirst, the legal age of consent in most U.S. states is 16 or 18, but since both are minors, their relationship isn't illegal. However, the author's son is 17, which is legal in most places. But the key issue here is whether the author is justified in contacting Jess's parents without her consent.\n\nJess is 16 and hasn't told her parents. The author's son is in a lot of emotional pain, and the author is worried about the potential pregnancy affecting their futures. The author mentions that Jess is in a relationship with Sam, who is a virgin by choice, and that she might be using him. The author is considering stepping in because Jess isn't taking the situation seriously.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents usually have a duty to protect their children, but in this case, the author isn't Jess's parent. If Jess is an adult (18), the author might not have the right to contact her parents. But since Jess is 16, her parents are her legal guardians. However, the author is not Jess's parent; the parents are her own. So, the author is a third party. \n\nBut there's a potential pregnancy, which could be an emergency. In some cases, if a minor is at risk of harm, others can contact the authorities or the parents. But is this a case of imminent harm? If Jess is underage and pregnant, that could be a concern, but the author doesn't have evidence yet. Jess hasn't confirmed the pregnancy, just \"thinks\" she is. However, she's missed three periods, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's son is suffering severely\u2014vomiting, migraines, etc.\u2014so the author is motivated by concern for his son's well-being. But does that justify contacting another family without their consent? It might depend on the laws in their state. In some places, if a parent or guardian believes a minor is in a dangerous situation, they can report it to authorities or contact the other parents. But is this a situation where the author is overstepping?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jess previously sent screenshots of Sam's messages where he acted like an \"asshole.\" The author dealt with that, implying some prior conflict. Now, the author is considering taking action again. \n\nThe author's intention is to resolve the uncertainty by getting a pregnancy test, which could help Sam decide whether to break up. But contacting Jess's parents without her consent might breach privacy. However, if the author believes Jess is in a harmful situation or that Sam is being manipulated, maybe the author has grounds.\n\nBut is the author ethically in the wrong? If the author contacts Jess's parents without her consent, it could be seen as interfering in their family matters. But the author's son is a minor too, so his well-being is also a concern. The author might think they're acting in his son's best interest.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, privacy is important, but so is preventing harm. If the author's actions could prevent a potential breakup or emotional harm to Sam, maybe it's justified. However, it's also possible that the author is overstepping, as Jess's parents should handle their own child's situation. The author might not have the right to make that call.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jess has a history of casual relationships and that the relationship might not be healthy. But the author isn't Jess's parent, so maybe they shouldn't be involved. However, the author's son is a minor, and the author is his parent, so the parent's role is to protect Sam's interests.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parent's action is justified to protect their son's well-being, even if it means contacting another family. Legally, it's unclear, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention is to prevent harm to their son, but they could be overstepping by contacting Jess's parents without her consent. However, given the minors' ages and the potential pregnancy, the parent's concern is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the emotional distress of their son and the potential impact on his future, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
