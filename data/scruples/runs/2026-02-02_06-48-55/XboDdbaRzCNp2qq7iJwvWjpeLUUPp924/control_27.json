There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to contact her son's girlfriend's parents because Jess (the girlfriend) is possibly pregnant and won't take a test. First, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nThe son is 17 and the girlfriend is 16. Depending on the jurisdiction, the age of consent varies. If they're both minors, and if it's below the age of consent in their area, then there's a potential legal issue. Even if it's just a relationship, the author's involvement might be justified if there's a concern about the girl's well-being or if there's a legal angle. But the main question is about contacting the parents without the daughter's consent.\n\nJess is refusing to talk to her parents and take a pregnancy test. The author's son is really stressed, even physically ill. The author is considering stepping in after the week is up. The son was previously acting inappropriately, which the author found out about through screenshots. Also, the author mentions that Jess had several friends-with-benefits partners before the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: both minors, possible legal concerns if under age of consent; the girlfriend's refusal to take a test; the mother's concern for her son's health and future; prior inappropriate behavior from the son; and the girlfriend's history with other partners.\n\nNow, in terms of ethics and parental rights. The mother might feel responsible for her son's welfare, but does that extend to contacting the girlfriend's parents? If Jess is a minor, her parents have a right to be informed about her health, especially potential pregnancy. However, the mother's son is also involved, so it's a complex situation.\n\nIf the author contacts Jess's parents, she's taking a proactive step to resolve the issue. But is that her right? Jess might prefer privacy, and the mother is acting without Jess's consent. However, given the age of the son and daughter, and if the relationship is legally not permissible, the mother might have a duty to report or involve authorities. But the user is asking about contacting the parents, not reporting to a legal authority.\n\nAlso, the author has a history of dealing with her son's behavior (the screenshots), so maybe she's in a position to believe that Jess isn't being honest or that there's a problem. But the main issue is the pregnancy scare. The author's intention is to get Jess to take a test, which is important for both teens' futures, especially since the son is on track for a scholarship.\n\nIn some cases, parents have the right to intervene when their child is in a dangerous situation, but when it comes to another minor, the line is blurry. Jess's parents are the ones responsible for her, so the author might be justified in reaching out to them if her son is at risk or if there's a need to protect both teens. However, some might argue that the author should let Jess's parents handle it, or that the author is overstepping.\n\nLegally, if the relationship is illegal (underage sexual activity), the mother might have a responsibility to inform the authorities. But if it's legal, then maybe she's overstepping by contacting the parents. Ethically, the mother is trying to help her son and prevent a crisis, but she's doing so in a way that could be seen as violating Jess's privacy.\n\nThe fact that Jess is a minor and the author's son is close to that age could mean that the author's actions are in the best interest of both children. However, the mother's intervention without the daughter's consent could be problematic. If the mother contacts the parents, it might be considered a parental duty to protect their minor child, but in this case, both are minors. The answer might depend on the specific laws regarding minors and parental rights in their area.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a general opinion, I need to think if the author is in the wrong. Some would say that the parents of the son have no right to contact the parents of the daughter without consent, especially if it's just a health issue. Others might say that given the son's well-being and the potential impact on his future, the mother is justified in taking action. There's also the aspect of Jess's own well-being, as a possible pregnancy is a serious matter for a 16-year-old.\n\nIn many places, minors can't make all their own decisions, and parents have a duty to step in if they believe there's a threat to their child's health. However, the author is a parent of the son, not the daughter. So the author's role here is different. Contacting the parents might be seen as a breach of privacy, but if there's a risk of pregnancy and the daughter is refusing to take a test, maybe the mother is acting in the best interest of her son and the daughter by ensuring the daughter is getting medical attention.\n\nBut there's also the question of whether the author has a right to contact the parents. Unless there's a legal requirement or a situation where the daughter's health is at risk, the author might be overstepping. However, if the daughter is under 18, her parents are legally responsible for her, so the author's intervention could be necessary to ensure the daughter's health is addressed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because she's a parent concerned about her minor son's well-being and the health of the other minor, and perhaps the parents have a duty to ensure their children are safe, especially if there's a legal issue. But I need to check if the author's son is over the age of consent. If the age of consent is 16 in their state, then the relationship is legal, but if it's higher, like 18, then it's illegal. The user didn't specify the location, so it's tricky. The author mentions that the baby could not be his because they haven't been in contact since last summer, but the current situation is a pregnancy scare. If the relationship was legal when they were together, maybe now Jess is older, but the son is 17. If the age of consent is 16, then Jess is now 16, so the relationship is legal. But if it's 18, then the son is still underage, which is a problem.\n\nAssuming the relationship is legal, the author is trying to help her son and the daughter, so maybe she's not in the wrong. If the relationship is illegal, then the mother might have a duty to inform the authorities, not just the parents. But the question is about contacting the parents, not the authorities. So even if it's legal, the mother's action is a gray area. But given that Jess is refusing to take a test, the mother's intervention could be in the best interest of both teens. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
