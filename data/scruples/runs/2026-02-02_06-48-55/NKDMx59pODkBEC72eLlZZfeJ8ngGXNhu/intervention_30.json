      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot near the front, and when people ask to go in front because they're shorter, the author declines, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about concert etiquette and the impact of their height. At concerts, people often try to get the best view possible. Taller people blocking shorter ones can be an issue because they might obscure the view. The author is in a central spot, two people back from the stage, which is a prime location. \n\nThe author mentions that people are asking to go in front, so there's a request being made. The author's response is to decline and apologize. Now, whether they're in the wrong depends on cultural norms and expectations. In some places, it's considered polite to let shorter people get closer if they have the same or better access to the front. The idea is to share the space so everyone can enjoy the concert. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were there first and have a right to their spot. But concerts are dynamic environments where movement can be expected. If others are genuinely unable to see because of the height difference, the author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author is also trying to enjoy their experience and might not want to compromise their position. \n\nAnother angle is the number of times people are asking. If it's multiple people throughout the night, the author's consistent refusal might be more problematic. The death stares suggest frustration from others, which could indicate that the author is disrupting their experience. \n\nBut then again, concert etiquette can vary. Some people might not mind if they got a good spot, especially if they're with family. The author is with their mum, who is also tall, which might make it harder to move aside without affecting both of them. \n\nI need to weigh the right to a spot versus the consideration for others. In crowded events, there's an unspoken agreement to share space. If the author's height is causing others to miss out on the concert experience, their refusal might be seen as selfish. However, if they're in a spot they earned or paid for, there's an argument for them keeping their position. \n\nAlso, the author apologizes, which shows they acknowledge the inconvenience, but the act of declining might still be considered inconsiderate. The key is whether there's a balance between personal enjoyment and communal experience. \n\nIn similar situations, like waiting in line, people are often expected to let others pass if they're being blocked. Extending that logic to concerts, the author might be expected to let shorter people to the front to ensure everyone can see. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of safety and personal space. If people are constantly asking, it might be intrusive. However, the main issue is view obstruction. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because they're aware of the problem and continue to refuse, leading to others' frustration. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that they have a right to their spot. Hmm.\n"
