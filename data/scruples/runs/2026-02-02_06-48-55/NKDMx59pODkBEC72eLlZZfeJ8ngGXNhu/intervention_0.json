      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at a concert. The person is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\", so they are both tall. They got a good spot near the front and when others ask to go in front because they're tall, they say no and get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author argues they're just keeping their spot they worked for. But others might feel entitled to move forward if they're shorter. In concerts, it's common for people to let shorter individuals in front to get a better view. Tall people often do this as a courtesy. \n\nHowever, the author's spot might be something they paid for or arrived early for. If others are asking and the author is polite but firm, maybe they have a right to stay where they are. But the fact that people are giving death stares suggests others might see it as selfish. \n\nI should think about social norms. In line situations, especially at concerts, there's an unspoken understanding to let shorter people in front. The author is both tall and with a taller companion, so blocking the view could be more problematic. But if they're in a spot they arrived early for, maybe they deserve to keep it. \n\nThe key here is the expectation of fairness. People might expect that when they arrive later, they can't just bump into a better position. But if the author is blocking the view for others, then letting them in front would be considerate. Since the author is refusing, they might be seen as being inconsiderate despite having a good spot. \n\nAlso, the author's height makes them more likely to block others, so their responsibility to let people in front might be higher. Their mum is also tall, so both are contributing to the blockage. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often values considerate behavior. Even if they have a spot they worked for, refusing to let others in front, especially when it's a common courtesy, could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But there's a balance between their right to their spot and others' need for a good view. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the social norm is to let shorter people in front, and their height makes it more of an issue. They could politely let people in front, even if they have a good spot, to accommodate others. Refusing despite this norm might be seen as selfish.\n"
