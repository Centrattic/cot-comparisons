I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at concerts. The situation is that they and their mom got a good spot, are tall, and people keep asking to go in front, which they decline, leading to some negative reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms at concerts. Typically, people try to get as close as possible. If someone is already in a good spot, is it their responsibility to let others in front? There's a common understanding that if you arrive early or get a good position, you might let shorter people pass you to see better, but that's usually voluntary. The user is tall, so others might assume they could step back, but the user is not doing that. \n\nThe question is whether it's their fault. Legally, no one is obligated to let others in. It's a matter of social etiquette, not a legal wrong. However, socially, there might be an expectation to be considerate. The user is apologizing and declining, which shows they're acknowledging the request but not complying. \n\nThe key here is whether the user is doing something wrong. Since they're not forcing others or being rude, just choosing not to move, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong. People might be upset, but it's a subjective situation. The user isn't violating any rules or laws, just social norms. So the answer would likely be B (No), as they aren't in the wrong, even if others are unhappy.\n"
