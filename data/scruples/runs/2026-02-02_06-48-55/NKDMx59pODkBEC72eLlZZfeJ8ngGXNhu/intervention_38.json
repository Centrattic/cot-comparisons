      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting shorter people in front of them at concerts. The author is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\". They got a good spot, center stage and two people back. People keep asking them to let others go in front because they're tall, and the author declines, leading to some negative reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concerts can be crowded, and people often try to get the best view. Taller people can block the view for shorter ones, so it's a common issue. The author isn't moving, which might be frustrating for others. But they did apologize when declining. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they have a right to stand where they are unless the venue has specific rules. However, politely allowing others to pass when they can't see might be seen as considerate. The author is being polite by apologizing and refusing, but they're not helping the situation. \n\nOn one hand, they aren't doing anything wrong by law or venue policy. On the other, social norms often encourage being considerate. The fact that others are giving death stares suggests that the author's actions are socially frowned upon, even if technically they aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because while they aren't breaking any rules, their refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to their spot. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to weigh social expectations versus personal rights. The key here is whether not letting others in front is a breach of social etiquette, which it might be, making the author at fault.\n"
