The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot near the front. People later in the line are asking to go in front because they're shorter, but the author refuses. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert rules. Usually, the first-come, first-served basis applies. If you arrive early, you get a better spot. The author got there early and secured a good position, which they have every right to. Tall people might block the view for shorter folks behind them, but in this case, the author is already in a central spot and the people asking to go in front are likely trying to get closer to the stage. However, the author's stance is that they're not letting people in front, not behind. So maybe it's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the people are asking to go in front of the author because they're tall. If the author is already near the front, letting shorter people in front might not make sense. But maybe the author is blocking the view for even taller people? Wait, the author is 6'7\", which is extremely tall. So if they're near the front, they're likely obstructing the view for people behind them. But the scenario says people are asking to go in front, not behind. So perhaps the author is in the front row, and shorter people behind are asking to move in front? That doesn't make sense unless the venue allows people to cut the line by letting others in front. But typically, you can't cut in line once it's formed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the people are trying to get closer to the stage, but the author is already in a central spot. If the author is two people back from the front, maybe the people who came later are trying to push their way in front, which would be against the usual order. The author's refusal is actually correct because once the line is established, you can't just move people forward. The author has a right to their spot, and people shouldn't be allowed to cut in front. So in that sense, the author is not in the wrong. The problem might be that the people are trying to get in front for a better view, but the author is maintaining their position. Also, the author is apologizing, which shows they're trying to be polite but standing their ground. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes concerts have rules where taller people are asked to stand to the side to avoid blocking. If the venue didn't enforce that, maybe the author should have moved, but they didn't. However, the question is about whether it's wrong to refuse to let shorter people in front. If the author is in a spot they earned by arriving early, they aren't obligated to let others in front. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are just protecting their position, which is standard in first-come scenarios.\n"
