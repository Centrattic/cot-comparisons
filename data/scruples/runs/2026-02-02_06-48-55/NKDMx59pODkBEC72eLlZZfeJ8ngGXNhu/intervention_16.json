      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\", so both are tall. They're in a good spot (center stage, two back) and people behind them are asking to move in front because they're tall. The author declines and apologizes, but gets death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. At concerts, people often try to get the best view, which is usually the front. However, if someone is tall, they can block the view for those behind. So, there's an expectation that taller people might let shorter people go in front to avoid blocking. But the author is already in a good spot. They didn't push their way forward, so maybe they have a right to stay there. \n\nOn the other hand, if others are being blocked from seeing the stage because the author is tall, it's considerate to let them pass. However, the author is with their mum, so they might be there to enjoy the concert together. They might not want to move because they got a good spot. \n\nAnother angle: when you arrive at a concert, you take up a space. If others arrived after, they might be in a worse spot. The author isn't blocking people behind them who arrived before. Wait, if people are coming later and asking to move in front, maybe the author is blocking their view. But if the author got there first, they have a right to stay where they are. However, if their height is causing a problem for others who came after, the author might be expected to adjust. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. If the author is blocking people's view by being in the front, then they might be in the wrong. But if they're in the second row and their height isn't the main issue, maybe not. The fact that others are asking to go in front suggests that their presence is causing a blockage. \n\nThe author says they apologize, which shows they're aware of the issue. But they still decline, which might be seen as not being considerate. However, it's their spot they earned. There's a conflict here between personal rights and communal enjoyment. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if you're tall, you should let shorter people go in front to ensure everyone can see. The author is not moving, so maybe they are in the wrong. But if they got there first and the people asking are later, the author has the right to stay. \n\nThe key factor is whether the author's height is the primary issue. If their height is blocking a good view for others, even if they're not in the very front, they might be expected to let people in front. However, if they're in a spot that's already not the absolute front, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the concert's typical behavior. If it's common for people to adjust for others, then the author is in the wrong. But if it's a first-come, first-served basis, then they aren't. Since the people are asking to go in front, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not accommodating, even if they got there first. But maybe not, because they have a right to their spot.\n"
