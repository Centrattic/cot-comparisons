      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert because they're tall. The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11, standing in a good spot. People keep asking to go in front, they decline and apologize, but get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concerts often have standing areas where people try to get the best view. Taller people can block shorter ones, so there's an unspoken rule that taller individuals might step back to let shorter ones see. The author is refusing to let people in front, which some might see as selfish.\n\nThe key points here are: Did they get the spot first? If they arrived early and secured the spot, they might have a right to stay. However, the concert etiquette usually encourages sharing space, especially if there's a clear line or queue. But the user mentions that people are asking throughout the night, not just once. So maybe the problem is that they're not making space even when others are clearly trying to get a better view.\n\nAlso, the author apologizes when declining, which shows they're aware of the issue. But the death stares suggest others are upset. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize their spot despite causing inconvenience to others.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because in such settings, it's considered polite to let shorter people in front if possible. Even if they got there first, refusing multiple times might be seen as being inconsiderate. The author's height is a factor here, as their size is blocking the view more than smaller people would. So, while they have a right to stand where they are, not allowing others to move forward when asked multiple times could be seen as wrong. But there's a counterpoint that they aren't obligated to move unless there's a specific rule or agreement. Hmm. Maybe it's a cultural norm more than a rule. So ultimately, the answer might be A because they're not following the social expectation to let others see the concert.\n"
