      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is at fault for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The scenario is that they're at a concert, in a central spot, and because they're tall (the person is 6'7\", and their mom is 5'11\"), others are asking them to move back so shorter people can get a better view. They decline and apologize, but they get death stares.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the concert setting. People usually queue up for concerts, and positions are based on when they arrive. The author got there early and secured a good spot. Others who arrived later are asking them to move because their height is blocking the view. The author is refusing, even though they apologize.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette. Generally, people are expected to not block others' views. If someone is tall, it's polite to stand to the side or the back to make space. But the author is in the center, which is a prime spot. They argue that they got there first, so it's their spot. But others are being asked to move back to let shorter people in front. The conflict arises when the author refuses to let others pass.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in a position where their height is causing an issue. Even if they got there first, their presence blocks others. So, maybe they should adjust their position to accommodate others. However, they might feel they have the right to their spot since they arrived early. But concert etiquette often prioritizes the view for everyone, so taller people are expected to adjust.\n\nThe author's mom is also 5'11\", which is tall, so both of them are contributing to the blockage. The fact that they apologize but still refuse might be seen as inconsiderate. People who come later might feel entitled to a good view, and the author's refusal could be perceived as selfish. On the other hand, the author isn't physically blocking anyone if they're standing still; it's their height that's the issue. So, maybe it's more about their height than their right to the spot.\n\nIn some cases, venues have rules about this, but the question is about social responsibility. If the author is in a central spot and their height is making others uncomfortable, they might be expected to move to the back or side. Not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate. However, they might not be in the wrong if they believe they deserve the spot because they arrived first. But concert culture often values the collective experience, so individual spots might need to be adjusted for the group's benefit.\n\nSo, weighing these factors. The author's actions are causing discomfort to others. While they have a right to their spot, their height is affecting others' enjoyment. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not accommodating others despite their good intentions. But it's a nuanced situation. The answer could depend on cultural norms or specific venue policies, but generally, in social settings, it's expected to be considerate of others. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
