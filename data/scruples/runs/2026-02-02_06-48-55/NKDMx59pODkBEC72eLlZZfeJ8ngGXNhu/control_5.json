      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\", their mom is 5'11\", and they're in a good spot. People keep asking to go in front because they're tall, but the author declines and gets death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, if someone is already in a good spot, especially with their family, they have a right to stay there. But some people might expect taller individuals to let shorter ones pass for a better view. However, the author is with their mom, so they might be trying to protect their spot and not block the view for others. \n\nBut wait, if they're at the front, their height could block the view for people behind them. However, the author mentions they're two people back from the stage, so maybe they're not the first row. Also, the people asking are those who arrived later. The author didn't choose the spot; they got there early. It's common for people to get closer to the stage as the concert goes on, but if the author didn't block anyone when arriving, they might have a valid claim to their spot. \n\nOn the other hand, if their presence is obstructing the view for others, even if they arrived first, they might be expected to let people pass. But since they're with family, it's a personal choice. The key point is whether they're blocking others. If they're not blocking the view, just taking up space, they're not in the wrong. But if their height is causing people behind to have a bad view, then they might be at fault. The scenario isn't entirely clear, but the author is polite, offering apologies and not being rude. \n\nIn many cases, concertgoers are expected to let shorter people through if they're blocking, but the author is two back from the front, so maybe they're not the main obstruction. Also, the people asking are later arrivals, implying the author got there early. So, considering all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They have a right to their spot, and it's not their fault for being tall. The answer might be B, but I need to check if there's a standard etiquette rule about this. Some places have \"no blocking\" policies, but concerts can be chaotic. Since the author is polite and not causing intentional harm, they're probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
