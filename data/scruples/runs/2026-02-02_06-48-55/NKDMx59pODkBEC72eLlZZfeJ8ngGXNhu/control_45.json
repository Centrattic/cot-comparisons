      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The scenario is that they're both tall (6'7\" and 5'11\") and people behind them are asking to move in front because they're tall. The author declines politely, but others give them death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of concert standing. Usually, people try to get the best view they can. If someone is standing in a good spot, especially with someone taller, it's common for shorter people behind to ask to move ahead. The author is in a central spot, which is prime real estate. By the nature of standing in front, taller people can block the view for those behind. So, there's an unspoken social norm that if you're in a good spot and others are being obstructed, you might allow them to move up. \n\nHowever, the author and their mum got there early enough to secure a good position. They might argue they earned their spot by arriving early. But when people behind are asking to move up because they can't see, the author's refusal could be seen as selfish. The key here is whether the author has any obligation to let others in front. \n\nAnother angle: concerts often have a mosh pit or general admission areas where people jostle for position. In such cases, it's expected that people might need to move to see. If the author is blocking the view, even if they got there first, others might feel entitled to move up. But the author is also there with their mum, so maybe they want to stay together. \n\nThe author's actions: they apologize when declining, so they're polite. But the question is about being in the wrong. The \"wrong\" here isn't about breaking a rule, but about social unacceptability. In many social situations, if your presence is causing inconvenience, others might expect you to accommodate. However, if you got there first, some might argue you have the right to stay. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If someone is in a good spot and others behind can't see, allowing them to move up is considerate. But if you're there early and it's not a standing-only concert, maybe they have the right to stay. The problem is the death stares indicating others are upset. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're causing frustration despite their polite refusal. On the other hand, they're not violating any rules by staying where they are. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (they are in the wrong) because in such situations, the social norm is to let others move up if you're blocking their view, even if you arrived first. The fact that people are giving death stares suggests that the community perceives this as inconsiderate. So, the author might be wrong for not being accommodating despite their good spot.\n"
