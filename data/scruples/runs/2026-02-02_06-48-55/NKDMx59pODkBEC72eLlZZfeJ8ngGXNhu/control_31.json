I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\". They got a good spot (center stage, two people back). People behind them ask to move in front because they're tall, but they decline and apologize. Others give them death stares.\n\nI need to determine whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's think about concert etiquette. Typically, at concerts, people stand where they are because the venue manages the crowd to ensure safety. If someone got to the venue first and secured a good spot, they have a right to stay there unless there's a specific reason to move, like safety or accessibility issues. \n\nThe author mentions that people are asking to \"let them in front\" because they're shorter. But height isn't a valid reason to move someone. The author and their mom arrived early and got a better spot. Others might be frustrated if they didn't get there in time, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the venue has a policy where taller people are asked to move for a better view, but the author is refusing, that could be an issue. But the scenario doesn't mention any such policy. Also, the author is polite, declining and apologizing, which shows they're considerate but still standing by their spot.\n\nAnother angle: concerts can be about personal space and safety. If people are pushing or trying to take spots, that's a problem. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're maintaining their position that they earned by arriving early. The death stares from others might indicate frustration among the crowd, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's a common issue where people want better views but didn't get there on time.\n\nSo, the key points are: right of way based on arrival time, respect for personal space, and no mention of any policy against tall people. The author isn't violating any rules, just defending their spot. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
