I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at concerts. The author is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\", so they're both tall. They got a good spot near the front and people keep asking to go in front because they're blocking the view. The author says they decline and apologize, but others give them death stares.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether it's wrong to not let others go in front when they ask. Let me think. At concerts, people usually try to get the best view possible. If someone is tall and blocking a shorter person's view, it's common courtesy to let them go in front. The author and their mom are both tall, so they're likely obstructing the view for others. By not letting the shorter people move ahead, they might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention they apologize when they decline. However, just apologizing doesn't necessarily justify the action. The people asking are probably in a worse position because they can't see the concert. The author is prioritizing their own spot over others who need to be in front for a better view. \n\nAlso, considering concert etiquette, I think it's generally expected that taller people step back or let shorter people go in front. The author is using their height advantage to maintain a spot that might not be fair to others. The fact that people are giving death stares suggests that the author's actions are seen as selfish or rude by others there.\n\nSo, even though the author had a good spot, not allowing others to move up when asked could be seen as inconsiderate. The balance between personal space and considering others' needs is important in public settings like concerts. The author's refusal, despite multiple requests, might be the wrong choice here. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
