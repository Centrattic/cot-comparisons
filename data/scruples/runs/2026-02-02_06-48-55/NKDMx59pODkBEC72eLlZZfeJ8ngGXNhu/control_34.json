      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at a concert. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person is 6'7\", which is really tall, and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot at a concert, right behind the stage. Throughout the night, people who came later ask if they can go in front because the author and their mum are tall. The author declines and apologizes, but others give them death stares. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider concert etiquette. At concerts, people often try to get the best view possible. Since the author and their mum are tall, it's understandable that shorter people might ask to go in front to see better. But the author is in a good spot they worked to get. Is it fair for them to hold that spot even if others need it more?\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't take up the front row because they were there first. Maybe they arrived early and secured the spot. If they're blocking the view, it's polite to let others go in front. On the other hand, if they specifically wanted that spot for their height, they might not want to give it up. But the problem is that others are asking, and the author is refusing. \n\nConcert etiquette usually involves being considerate. If you're tall, it's common to step back to let shorter people in front. However, the author is not moving forward; they're staying in their spot. If people are asking to go in front, the author might be in the way. But the author is there first. So maybe it's a balance between right of place and consideration.\n\nI remember some people argue that if you're in a good spot, you should let others go in front. Others say you can't be forced to move. The author isn't being rude, they apologize and decline. But others are upset. Is it the author's fault? Maybe not entirely. They might not have a responsibility to let others in front unless it's part of the venue's rules. However, social norms often expect taller people to step back. But in this case, the author isn't in the front; they're two people back. So maybe their presence is blocking the view for some, but they might have paid for that spot. \n\nIf the venue allows first-come, first-served, then the author has the right to stay. However, if the crowd expects taller people to step back, then the author might be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. But since they are not in the absolute front and are just two people back, maybe their height is causing an issue. The key is whether there's an unspoken rule to let shorter people in front when you're tall. If that's the norm, then the author might be in the wrong. If not, then they're not. \n\nI think in most cases, people do expect taller individuals to be considerate and let others go in front. So the author might be in the wrong for not doing that. But they are also in a spot they got to, so it's not entirely their fault. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but according to the questioner's options, it's either A or B. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and considering social norms, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe B if it's about personal choice. Hmm.\n"
