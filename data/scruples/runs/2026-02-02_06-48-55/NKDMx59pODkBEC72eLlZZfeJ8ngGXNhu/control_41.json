I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\". They got a good spot near the front. People behind them ask to move in front because they're tall, but the author declines. Some people give them death stares for it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, in mosh pits or general admission areas, people do let shorter folks go in front so they can see. Taller people taking up space can block views, so it's common to let others pass. But this is near the stage, so maybe it's a different situation. \n\nThe author is with their mom, so they might be trying to stay together. But if others need to see the stage, blocking them could be inconsiderate. The author is declining politely, but the act of not letting people pass might still be seen as rude, even if they apologize.\n\nAlso, the people asking are likely shorter and can't see over the author. The author isn't taking up space for fun; they're in a prime spot. It's possible that concert etiquette dictates that taller people make space. So the author might be in the wrong by not accommodating others, even if they got there first. \n\nBut another angle: they paid for the spot and have a right to be there. However, concerts often prioritize visibility for everyone. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether it's a standing rule in concerts to let shorter people in front. If that's the norm, then the author is in the wrong. If not, then they're not. But I think the norm is to let people pass if they need visibility. So the answer is A (Yes).\n"
