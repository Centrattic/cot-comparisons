I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about the person and their mum, who are both tall, not letting smaller people go in front of them at a concert. The question is whether they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, in crowded events like concerts, people try to make space for shorter individuals so they can see the stage. Tall people are often asked to move back or let others go in front. The person here is refusing, even though they have a good spot. \n\nThe author says they apologize and decline, but others are giving death stares. So the issue is whether it's acceptable to hold that spot despite being asked. \n\nI think the key points are: \n1. Concerts typically prioritize visibility for all attendees. \n2. Taller people are expected to adjust their positions to accommodate shorter ones. \n3. The author isn't letting others in, which could block their view for others. \n\nSo, from an etiquette standpoint, the author might be in the wrong because they're not contributing to the general enjoyment of the event. Even though they paid for the spot, the expectation is that everyone shares the space. Also, the author is in a central position, which is more valuable for sightlines. \n\nBut maybe there's a counterargument. The author is with their mum, and moving might not be comfortable. However, the general expectation is still to let others see, regardless of personal inconvenience. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
