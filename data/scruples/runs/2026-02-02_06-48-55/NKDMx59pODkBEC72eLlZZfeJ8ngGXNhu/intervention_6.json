      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about them not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert because they're tall. The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\", and they got a good spot near the stage. People keep asking to go in front, but they decline and apologize, and others give them death stares.\n\nFirst, I should think about the concert setting. When people go to concerts, they usually want the best view possible. Getting a spot close to the stage is a big deal. If someone is really tall, like 6'7\", they might block the view for people behind them, especially if those people are shorter. But in this case, the author is already two people back from the stage. Maybe there are people directly in front of them who are shorter, so the tall people are blocking their view. \n\nThe key point here is about uninvited requests. People are asking to go in front, which might not be their spot. The author got there early and secured a good position, so maybe they have a right to stay there. But if their height is obstructing others, maybe they should let shorter people go in front to have a better view. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't doing anything illegal; they can stand where they want unless there are specific rules. They might feel entitled to their spot because they arrived early. On the other hand, concert etiquette often suggests that taller people should let shorter ones pass in front to avoid blocking views. It's a common courtesy, even if not enforced. \n\nThe author is declining the requests and apologizing, which shows they're aware of the issue but still choose not to move. The other people's frustration, as indicated by death stares, suggests that others believe the author is being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the norm at concerts is to let shorter people go in front when they ask, then the author might be inconsiderate by not complying. However, if the author isn't being asked to move by the event organizers and the people are just requesting, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. But considering the general social norm of view-blocking, the author might be in the wrong by not accommodating others to ensure a better experience for everyone. \n\nAnother angle: the author's mum is also tall, so maybe they're blocking more people than just the ones asking. If they're both tall and in a central spot, even more reason for them to let shorter people move in front. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the common expectation to let shorter people pass. Even if they don't have to, being courteous and polite in such situations is usually appreciated. Their refusal might be seen as selfish, especially when others are trying to get a good view and are asking politely. \n\nSo, the answer is A.\n"
