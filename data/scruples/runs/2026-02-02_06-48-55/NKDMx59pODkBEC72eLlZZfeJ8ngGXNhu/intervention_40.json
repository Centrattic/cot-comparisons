I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at concerts. The situation is that the author and their mother are tall and have a good spot. People later ask them to move back, but they decline and get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around concerts. At live events, especially standing ones, people usually try to let shorter folks in front so they can see the stage. It's a common courtesy. The author is taking up space that might block others' views. \n\nThe author's reasoning might be that they paid for the spot or got there early, but fairness and consideration for others often take precedence. Even if you have a good spot, if you're tall, it's polite to let people through. The mother's height is 5'11, which is also on the taller side, so both of them together could block a lot of people. \n\nThe fact that people are asking repeatedly and giving death stares suggests that the author's actions are causing frustration. Declining to let people in might be seen as selfish, even if they apologize. The key point is whether it's reasonable to expect others to have consideration for shorter attendees. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not realize the impact of their height on others' experience. But in a public setting like a concert, there's an unspoken agreement to let people in front if they need to see. So, from a social etiquette standpoint, the author might be in the wrong by refusing to move back. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal space and not being forced to move. But in such situations, the norm is to prioritize the group that can't see. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author is in a good spot, but if they're blocking others, then it's their responsibility to let people through. So, A makes sense.\n"
