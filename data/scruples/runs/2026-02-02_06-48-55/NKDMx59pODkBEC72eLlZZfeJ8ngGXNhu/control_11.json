      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The situation is that the author and their mum are tall, and they got a good spot (center stage, two people back). People later in the night are asking to go in front because they can't see, but the author declines each time. Others are giving them death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around concerts. Typically, people in front rows are expected to allow shorter people to get in front if they can't see. The idea is that the venue can't always guarantee visibility, so taller people are expected to be considerate. But the author is in the second row, which is still pretty good. Their mum is 5'11, which is tall for a woman, but not as tall as the author (6'7\"). Maybe the author is blocking the view even though they are in the second row. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did they get a good spot and are now blocking others? 2) Are they willing to let others go in front? 3) The reactions from others are negative (death stares), which the author is aware of. \n\nThe author apologizes when declining, which shows they are trying to be polite, but they still refuse. The people asking are likely in the same row but arrived later, so maybe they expected a better spot but didn't get it. The author's spot might be based on arrival time, which is common at concerts. However, being tall in a concert setting often requires allowing others to move in front if they can't see. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they are in a prime spot and their height is causing an issue, then maybe they should let people in. But if the venue is designed such that the first row is the front, and the author is in the second row, then perhaps the people behind them who can't see might have a right to move up. However, concert etiquette might vary. Some places have standing room only where you can't move, but others allow movement for better views. \n\nThe author's mum is also 5'11, which is tall for a woman, so maybe even she is causing some obstruction. However, the main issue is the author's height. The problem is that they are not allowing others to move up, leading to negative reactions. \n\nIn similar situations, people often suggest that if you're in a good spot and your height is preventing others from seeing, you should let them move in front. So in that case, the author might be in the wrong because they are not accommodating others. However, if the spot is based on arrival time and the author got there first, some might argue that others should have known the risks. \n\nBut the common etiquette is that taller people should let shorter ones in front. So the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they are not following that norm. The death stares suggest that others see this as inconsiderate. The author's apology doesn't change the fact that they are not letting people in front, which is the expected behavior. So the answer is A.\n"
