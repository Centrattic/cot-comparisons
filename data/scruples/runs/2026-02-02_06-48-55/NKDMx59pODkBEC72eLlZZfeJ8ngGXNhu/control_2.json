      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot at a concert and when shorter people ask to go in front because they're tall, they decline. Others get upset and give death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, people try to let shorter folks in front so everyone can see. If you're tall, it's kind of expected that you step back or let others pass. But the person here is in a good spot and is being asked by others to let them go in front. They're refusing and apologizing each time. \n\nSo, is it their fault? Well, if someone is in a position where they obstruct the view, especially if they're significantly taller, it's generally considered polite to step back. By not doing so, they might be making others uncomfortable. However, the person is in a spot they worked to get, and maybe they feel it's fair. But concert etiquette usually prioritizes visibility for everyone. \n\nAlso, the fact that people are getting upset and giving death stares suggests that the author's actions are causing conflict. Even if they apologize, refusing repeatedly could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is being asked to adjust their position for the benefit of others, which is a common social norm in such settings. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they're not accommodating others, even though it's a personal space. But maybe there's a counterpoint: they have the right to stand where they are. However, concert etiquette usually expects taller people to step back. So, I think the consensus would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
