      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. They're 6'7\" and their mother is 5'11\", which makes them both tall. Others are asking to go in front because they can't see over the tall people, but the author refuses, apologizing each time but still not letting them through.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social norms here. At concerts, people usually try to be considerate. If you're tall and blocking the view of others, especially if you're near the front, it's common to let shorter people in front. The author is in a central spot, which is a prime location, so maybe they have a right to stay there, but the issue is about blocking the view.\n\nThe key points: The author is being asked to let people in front of them repeatedly. They decline and apologize. Others give them death stares. The question is whether this is inconsiderate or reasonable.\n\nFrom one angle, the author is in their spot, which they got through valid means. They can't be forced to move, but they might be expected to accommodate others if it's easy. Since they are both tall, their presence is causing a problem. By not moving, they're prioritizing their own comfort over others' ability to see the concert, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is willing to apologize and not being aggressive, maybe they're doing their part. But the problem is that they're not allowing others to go in front when it's requested. The concert experience is about everyone enjoying it, so obstructing others' view could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the mother's height is 5'11\", which is still tall, so together they form a high barrier. \n\nI think the general consensus in such situations is that if you're in a good spot and your height is preventing others from seeing, it's polite to let shorter people in front. Refusing despite repeated requests might be seen as the author not being considerate. So, they might be in the wrong. But since they are apologizing, maybe it's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that they keep refusing and others are upset suggests that they are at least partially in the wrong. Answering A for yes.\n"
