      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\", so they're both tall. They got a good spot early, center stage, two people back. People later ask them to move forward because they're tall, but they decline, apologize, and get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At concerts, people often try to get the best possible view. Being tall can block the view for those behind. But the author is in a good spot and has the right to stay there since they arrived early. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong for not letting others in front of them.\n\nIn a mosh pit or a general admission area, people usually take up space as they arrive, and those who get there first have priority. But concert etiquette sometimes involves being considerate. For example, if someone is significantly taller and blocking a large group, moving forward might be courteous. However, the author and their mum are both tall but not blocking many people? The problem is that others are asking to go in front, implying that the author's height is an issue. The author is polite, apologizing, but still declining. \n\nIs there an expectation to let others in front if you're taller? It depends on the situation. Sometimes, people might ask if you can move forward to make space. In this case, the author isn't moving forward; they're staying where they are, which is their right. However, repeatedly refusing might be seen as inconsiderate if their height is causing significant obstruction. But the author's spot is center stage, which is a prime location. They might not want to lose their spot by moving forward, especially if they're there with a parent. \n\nAnother angle: if the author is blocking the view for multiple people, they might have a responsibility to adjust. However, if only a few people are asking and the rest can see fine, maybe not. Also, the author is in a good position, so maybe they shouldn't be forced to move. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not being rude; they're polite and apologetic. They're in their spot early, which is common at concerts. People might expect that if you get there early, you stay there. However, being tall does affect others' view, so there's an argument for moving forward if possible. But the author isn't moving forward; they're staying where they are. So maybe they're in the wrong for not accommodating others, even if they're polite. Alternatively, they have the right to stay where they are if they arrived first. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because their height is causing obstruction, and concert etiquette often involves being considerate by moving forward if you're blocking. But others might argue they have the right to their spot. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author is in the right because they arrived early and are polite. Alternatively, if their height is a problem, they might need to adjust. Wait, the author isn't moving forward. They are staying in their spot. Maybe they should move forward if possible to prevent blocking others. But they can't move forward because their spot is already good. Maybe they're not in the wrong. This is tricky. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong) because they have the right to their spot and are being polite. Others should understand that early arrivers get prime spots, and if their height is an issue, they could adjust their stance. But since they're already in a good spot, they aren't obligated to move. However, some might see it as inconsiderate. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they're polite and in their spot, they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
