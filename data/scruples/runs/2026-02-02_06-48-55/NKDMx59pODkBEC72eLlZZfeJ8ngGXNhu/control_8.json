      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\", and their mom is 5'11. They have a good spot, center stage and two people back. People keep asking to move in front because \"we're tall,\" and they decline, getting death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. At concerts, especially in general admission areas, people often try to get the best spots. Taller people can block the view for shorter ones, which is a common issue. The author's height is a factor here. Even though the mom is 5'11, she's shorter than the author but still relatively tall. However, the main issue is the author's refusal to let people in front.\n\nIs there an expectation to let others go in front if they're shorter? I think in many cases, people who are taller are expected to step back to let shorter people see better. The author is in a prime spot, but by not allowing others to move in front, they might be blocking the view for others who arrived later or need a better view. The author apologizes, which shows they're aware of the issue, but their refusal still causes frustration.\n\nBut wait, the author got there first. If the spot was taken by others first, then the later arrivals might have less claim. However, concerts are often about getting as close as possible, and people might have different priorities. If the spot is already occupied by the author and their mom, but others are asking to move in because they can't see due to height, the author's height is a valid reason for the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't necessarily at fault for choosing to stay where they are. They paid for the tickets and arrived in time to get the spot. The question is about whether they're in the wrong for not moving. Some might argue that it's considerate to step back when someone can't see over you, regardless of when you arrived. Others might say it's their spot and they have the right to stay.\n\nThere's a balance between personal rights and considering others. If the author is blocking a significant number of people, it's more their responsibility to adjust. But if only a few people are asking, maybe it's not so bad. The death stares suggest that others are really upset, which indicates that the author's actions are causing conflict.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because, in general, concert etiquette often prioritizes not blocking others' views. Even if you arrived first, if your height is causing an issue, it's considerate to step back. The author's refusal, despite apologizing, is causing frustration, which implies that their actions are not considerate enough.\n"
