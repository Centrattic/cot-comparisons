      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\", their mum is 5'11\", and they're getting asked to let people in front because they're tall. They decline and apologize but get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Concerts usually have a mosh pit or general admission areas where people stand close. Being tall can block the view for shorter people behind. The author is in a good spot, center stage, two people back. People are asking to go in front, which the author refuses. \n\nNow, I have to consider common practices. At concerts, it's often expected that if you're in a good spot but are tall, you might let shorter people go in front to see. That's a social norm I've heard about. So refusing might be seen as inconsiderate. But the author is with their mum, so maybe they're trying to protect their spot for family time. However, others might argue that the main purpose of being at a concert is to enjoy the show, and blocking others' views is selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't physically blocking anyone; they're just occupying a space. They can't be expected to move unless they volunteer. The people asking might not realize that the author is being polite by declining and apologizing. The death stares suggest frustration, maybe because others think they should let people in front.\n\nBut is the author actually wrong? It's a matter of perspective. If you're in a spot you worked to get, you might not want to let people in front unless you choose to. However, the concert experience is shared, and allowing shorter people to see could be more considerate. The key here is whether the author is violating a social contract of live events. In many cases, it's expected to let people in front if you're taller, hence the author might be in the wrong for not doing so. Alternatively, they aren't obligated to, so maybe not. \n\nThe community might side with the author if they prioritize personal space and the right to their spot, but others might think they should be more accommodating. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and the specific situation. Since the author is in a central spot, maybe the right to that spot is more important. But again, blocking others' views is a common issue. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because in live events, it's customary to let shorter people in front if you're tall. The author is creating a barrier that prevents others from enjoying the concert, even if they are in a good spot themselves. The apology might mitigate it, but the act of not letting people in is still seen as inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
