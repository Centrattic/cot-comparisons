I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for not letting shorter people go in front of them at a concert. The author is 6'7\", their mom is 5'11\", and they were in a good spot near the stage. People behind them kept asking to go in front because they're tall, but the author and their mom declined. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, people in the front try to make space for shorter folks so they can see. But here, the author is already in a good spot, and the people asking are shorter. The author is refusing because they're tall. So maybe the issue is that taller people should step back to let shorter ones have a better view. \n\nBut wait, the author's mom is also tall, so both of them being in the front might block the view for a lot of people. If they move back, they could be in a less optimal position. However, concert etiquette often prioritizes the collective experience over individual positions. \n\nAnother angle: the author isn't blocking anyone intentionally; they just got there first. Some might say you get to keep your spot if you arrived first. On the other hand, if people behind are shorter and can't see because of the height difference, it's courteous to let them in front. \n\nThe key point here is whether it's expected for taller people to step back. In many concerts, if you're too tall, you're asked to move back to let others see. But the author isn't moving. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not making space for others. \n\nAlso, the people are asking politely and the author is declining, leading to resentment. If the author can't see the stage, then they should move back, but since they can see (they're two people back from the stage), maybe they should adjust their position to accommodate others. \n\nSo the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're not considering the crowd's need for visibility. But maybe there's a counterargument that they have the right to their spot. However, concert etiquette usually emphasizes community, so the answer might be A.\n"
