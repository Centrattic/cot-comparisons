      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at a concert. The situation is that they're both tall, in a good spot, and people keep asking to go in front, leading to death stares when they decline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, people try to accommodate others, especially if they're blocking the view. But the author's height is a factor here. At 6'7\", they're significantly tall, and their mom is also 5'11\", which is tall for a woman. Being in the center stage area, their height could obstruct the view for people behind them.\n\nBut the key point is that the people asking to go in front are smaller. If someone shorter is trying to get a better view, it's common to let them pass. However, the author is already in a spot they secured, and concert etiquette might suggest that once you're in a good spot, you should make room for shorter fans. But the author is arguing that they're already polite and apologize when declining. \n\nAnother angle is the ownership of the spot. If they arrived early and got the spot, they have a right to stay. But if their height is causing a problem, maybe they should be more accommodating. However, the fact that they are polite and decline with apologies might mitigate the issue. The death stares from others could indicate frustration, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they aren't blocking anyone's view if they are standing in their own spot. However, since they are tall, they might be expected to step aside for shorter fans. But if they are already apologizing and declining politely, maybe it's a situational thing. However, the norm in concerts is to let shorter people have better views, so the author might be considered in the wrong for not accommodating. But it's a bit tricky because they are in a spot they earned. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. On one hand, concert etiquette often prioritizes shorter people's views. On the other, the author isn't actively blocking others unless they are in a way that physically obstructs. If they are standing normally, their height is a natural obstacle. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they can't control their height, but they could be expected to move if others need it. However, if they're polite and still get death stares, maybe the problem isn't entirely on them. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are polite, in a spot they earned, and their height is a physical factor beyond their control. While some might argue they should be more accommodating, the author is respecting others' requests but declining politely, which is reasonable. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
