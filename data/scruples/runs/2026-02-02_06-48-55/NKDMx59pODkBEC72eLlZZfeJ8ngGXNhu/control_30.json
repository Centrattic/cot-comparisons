      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at concerts. The situation is that they and their mum are tall, so they're getting asked by others to let them move forward because the tall people are blocking their view. The authors decline and apologize each time but get death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The concert is a public event where people pay to see the performance. The authors secured a good spot, central stage and two back. They are with their mother. People later in line approach them to move forward, but the authors refuse because they're tall. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and etiquette. When you arrive at a venue, especially a concert, the general expectation is that people who get there earlier can take up the best spots. However, if someone's view is blocked by taller individuals, it can be frustrating. But is it the authors' responsibility to give up their spot?\n\nConcert venues often manage crowd flow to prevent this. Maybe there were lines or barriers, but the authors might have arrived early and took up space. However, if they are with someone (their mother), they might have a right to stay where they are. \n\nAnother angle: some people might argue that in a public space, you should accommodate others if possible. But others might say that once you've found a spot, you can't be expected to move unless it's part of the venue's policy. Also, the authors are polite, apologizing each time, which shows they're not being rude, just firm. \n\nThe death stares from others indicate frustration, but that doesn't necessarily mean the authors are wrong. It's about personal space and the implied contract of attending an event. If the venue allows people to stand where they can, then the authors aren't in the wrong. However, if it's a mosh pit or a more fluid crowd, maybe there's an unspoken rule to let others through. \n\nAlso, considering the authors' height, they are taking up space that might be harder for shorter people to get through. But that's a physical reality. It's not their fault for being tall, but they might be aware of it. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they arrived early, secured the spot, and are polite. Others might be frustrated, but the authors aren't obligated to move. It's a common issue at concerts where people end up blocking views, and venues usually handle it with better crowd control. The authors are following the norm of holding their spot, even if it's inconvenient for others. So, they're not in the wrong.\n"
