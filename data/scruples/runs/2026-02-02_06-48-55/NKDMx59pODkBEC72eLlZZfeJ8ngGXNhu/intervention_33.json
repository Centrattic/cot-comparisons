I managed to get a great spot at a concert (centre stage and two people back) with my mum ( I\u2019m 6\u20197 and she\u2019s 5\u201911) and people who have arrived there later will ask us to let them go in front because \u201cwe\u2019re tall\u201d , we decline and apologise.

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The situation is about concert etiquette regarding height. The user is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\", so they're both tall. They got a good spot and people keep asking to go in front because they're blocking the view. The user says they decline and apologize each time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert dynamics. Usually, at concerts, especially in front rows, shorter people might ask taller ones to step aside to see better. It's a common practice. If you're in a prime spot, you might have a responsibility to let others see, especially if you're blocking their view. The user is in the center stage area, which is a key spot. \n\nBut wait, the user is already two people back. Maybe they aren't right at the front. But still, their height could block people behind them. The act of declining repeatedly might be seen as selfish. People who paid for tickets might expect a decent view, and if taller people refuse to let others see, that's inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the user is trying to enjoy their own experience too. They might argue they have a right to their spot. But concert etiquette often leans towards being considerate. Maybe there's a balance\u2014like moving aside occasionally or letting people in when they need it. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned apologizing, which shows they're aware they might be causing discomfort. But apologizing while still refusing might not be enough. The death stares from others indicate that others feel wronged. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If concert culture expects taller people to let shorter ones in front, then yes. The user isn't doing that, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But if there's no strict rule, maybe it's a personal choice. However, given common norms, I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
