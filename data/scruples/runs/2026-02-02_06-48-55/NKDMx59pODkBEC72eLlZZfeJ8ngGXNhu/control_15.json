      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert because they are tall. The author is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\", and they got a good spot. People keep asking to go in front, and they decline, leading to death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, people try to find their own spots based on their height to see the stage. Tall people are often asked to stand at the back to let shorter people in front. But here, the author is already in a good spot and is being asked to move. But they are tall, so maybe they are blocking the view for others? However, the people asking are shorter, so if the author is at the back, they might not be blocking. Wait, the author is in the center stage and two people back. Maybe the venue is arranged so that the front is stage, then rows. If they are two rows back, maybe there's space for shorter people to get in front of them. But if they are in a mosh pit or standing area, it's more chaotic.\n\nAnother angle: The author got a good spot first. It's common for people to try to find their own positions. If the author is standing in a spot that's not obstructing others, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Or maybe they are blocking the view for people behind them. Wait, the people asking to go in front are shorter, so the author being tall might be blocking their view. But if they are two rows back, maybe there's a balance. Also, the author's mom is also tall. So maybe they are blocking the front rows. But if they are in the second row, maybe they are in a spot where they should be aware of not blocking shorter people. \n\nConcert etiquette usually suggests that people should make space for shorter people. But sometimes, if someone got there first, they have a right to their spot. However, if they are blocking others' view, they might be expected to move. But in this case, the author is declining to move, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author is also in a good spot they worked to get. \n\nAnother point: The author is being asked multiple times and getting death stares. Maybe the people in front are annoyed because they can't see. But if the author is two people back, maybe they are not the main obstacle. It's possible that others in the front row are the actual issue. But the author's height might be causing a problem. \n\nIn such situations, it's a balance between personal space and consideration. The author might not be in the wrong if they are in a spot they deserve and others are being inconsiderate. However, if they are actively blocking others' view, they might be expected to move. Since the author is tall, it's reasonable to ask them to stand in the back. If the venue is arranged with a standing area, there's an understanding that tall people should step back. \n\nThe answer might depend on the venue's layout. If it's a general standing area without assigned spots, the author could be in the wrong for not accommodating shorter people. But if spots are claimed based on arrival, they might not be. However, concert etiquette often leans towards allowing shorter people to have better views, so the author might be in the wrong by not moving despite being asked.\n"
