      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not letting smaller people go in front of them at concerts. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot at the front, center stage. People behind them are asking to move in front because they're tall. The author says they decline and apologize, but others give them death stares. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider concert etiquette. Usually, at concerts, people try to accommodate shorter folks by letting them move in front if they can't see over taller people. But the author is already quite tall. If they're two people back from the stage, maybe even taller people behind them are struggling to see. But the author is tall themselves. \n\nHowever, the author's mum is 5'11\", which is also tall, but maybe not as much. The problem is that people behind them are asking to move forward. If the author is in a good spot, perhaps they should consider letting shorter people in front of them so they can see the stage. \n\nBut here's a catch: the author might have a right to their spot. If they arrived early and secured a good position, others might understand that they can't just take that spot. However, concert culture often values seeing the performance, and if someone can't see, it's expected that taller people make space. \n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to be polite by apologizing but not letting people in front. Maybe they feel that their spot is compromised if they let people in front, but if they're already two people back, maybe there's enough space for shorter people to move through. \n\nAlso, the death stares from others suggest that the community might frown upon this behavior. So socially, the author might be seen as inconsiderate. But legally or in terms of concert rules, maybe not. \n\nI should also think about the intent. The author isn't being rude, just firm about keeping their spot. But in a situation where others can't see the show, it's a common expectation to let them in front. So while the author isn't malicious, they might be in the wrong because their height blocks the view for others. \n\nBut then, if everyone who is tall in the front refuses to let people in front, the entire front row becomes inaccessible. The author's refusal contributes to that problem. So maybe the answer is A, they're in the wrong because they should let shorter people move in front to ensure everyone can enjoy the concert.\n"
