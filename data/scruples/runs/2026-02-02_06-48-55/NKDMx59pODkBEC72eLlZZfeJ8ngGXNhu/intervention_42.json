      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they and their mom, who are both tall, are in a good spot at a concert (center stage, two people back). People who come later ask them to let them move in front because they're tall, but they decline and apologize. The person feels like they're getting death stares for it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The concert spot they have was earned or purchased, right? If they paid for their spot or got there early, they have a right to be there. But some people might argue that in mosh pits or general admission areas, people expect to be able to move based on height. However, the author's spot is in the front but two people back, so maybe not the very front. \n\nThe key point is whether it's reasonable to expect that shorter people can't see because the author and their mom are tall. If they are in a section where sightlines are blocked, maybe they should consider letting shorter people in front. However, if the venue is set up so that everyone can see, then the author's height might not be the issue. \n\nAlso, the author is declining politely and apologizing. They aren't being rude, just firm. The people who come later might not have considered that the author got there early. There's an unspoken rule in some concerts where if you get there early, you let shorter people in front, but maybe that's more for the very front rows. \n\nThe author is 6'7\" and their mom is 5'11\", so both are tall. If the venue's structure allows for people behind to see over, maybe the issue isn't the author's height. But if the venue is a tight space where being tall blocks the view, then maybe the author should let shorter people in front. \n\nHowever, the author is in a spot they worked for, and people are just asking to cut in line. There's a difference between someone asking politely and the author's right to their spot. The author isn't blocking anyone unless the venue is set up for standing in a way that requires shorter people to be in front. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a grey area. The author has a right to their spot if they earned it, but if the venue's layout expects shorter people in front for visibility, they might be in the wrong. But since the author is two people back, maybe the issue isn't as severe as the very front. The answer could go either way, but I think the author isn't in the wrong if they got there early and the spot was available. So answer B.\n"
