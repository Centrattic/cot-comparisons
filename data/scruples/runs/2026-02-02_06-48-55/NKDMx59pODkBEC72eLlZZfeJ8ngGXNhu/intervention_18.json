      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting shorter people in front of them at a concert. The scenario is that the author and their mother, who are both tall, are in a good spot (center stage, two people back) and people ask them to let shorter people in front because they're blocking the view. The author declines and apologizes each time, but some people give them death stares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical concert etiquette. In concerts, especially standing ones, it's common for taller people to let shorter ones move in front if they're blocking the view. The reasoning is that the shorter people paid the same amount for a good view, so it's a matter of fairness and consideration. However, the author is in a spot that's already good, and they might have arrived early to secure that position. So, there's a conflict between the right to hold a spot and the expectation to be considerate.\n\nThe author's actions are declining the requests and apologizing. They might feel that they earned their spot by arriving early and that letting others in front could compromise their own experience. However, the other side argues that allowing shorter people to move up is a common courtesy, especially in such events where visibility is key. The death stares suggest that the author's actions are seen as inconsiderate, even if they are polite.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the concert or venue has an unspoken rule that taller people should let shorter ones pass, then the author might not be wrong for not following that, but they could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if there's no such rule, the author might just be following their own judgment. The key point is whether there's an expectation of such behavior in the given context.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author isn't being rude; they're apologizing. But the act of not allowing others in front could still be seen as selfish. It's a balance between personal right to a spot and community etiquette. In many cases, concerts encourage people to be mindful of others, so the author might be expected to adjust for the group's benefit.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the norm is to let shorter people in front for better visibility, even if they arrived later. The author is prioritizing their own position over others' experience, which could be seen as inconsiderate despite the polite apologies. But if the spot was secured early and there's no rule about that, it's a bit murky. But generally, the consensus in such situations leans towards allowing others to move up for visibility.\n"
