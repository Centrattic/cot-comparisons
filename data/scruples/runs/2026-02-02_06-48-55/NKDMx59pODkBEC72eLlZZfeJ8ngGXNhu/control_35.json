      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the scenario. The user is 6'7\" and their mum is 5'11\". They got a good spot at a concert, center stage and two rows back. People behind them keep asking to move in front because they're tall, but the user and their mum decline and apologize. Others are giving them death stares for not letting them. The user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for not letting shorter people in front.\n\nFirst, I should consider concert etiquette. Usually, when you arrive early, you get a good spot. If others arrive later, they might expect to be behind. But sometimes, people in the front might let shorter folks in front if they block the view. However, in this case, the user is already quite tall and their mum is too. So maybe they're blocking the view for others behind them. But the user is declining to move because they got there early. \n\nBut wait, the people asking are people who arrived later. If they bought tickets and arrived on time, maybe they expected a certain spot. But if the user arrived early and secured a spot that's supposed to be for the first few rows, then it's their right. However, if the venue allows people to queue and take spots as they come, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that they are apologizing suggests they're trying to be polite. The issue is that others are upset because they can't see the stage. But the user is tall, so even if they move back, they might still block the view. \n\nAnother angle: concert etiquette often says that if you're in the front and you're tall, you should let shorter people in front so others can see. However, if the user got there early, maybe they have the right to stay where they are. But if they're blocking the view of people who arrived later, then maybe they should let people in front. \n\nSo the question is, is it the user's responsibility to let shorter people in front even if they got there first? Some might argue that you should let people in front if you're tall, regardless of arrival time. Others might say that if you got there early, you deserve the spot. \n\nIn this case, the user is refusing to move, which is causing others to be upset. So the answer could depend on whether the user is considered responsible for blocking the view, even if they arrived early. \n\nI think the key point is the height. If the user is significantly taller, they might be blocking the view of others behind them, even if they got there early. In that case, the user would be in the wrong for not allowing shorter people to go in front. However, if the user is in their rightful spot and the people behind them are in the back rows, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut usually, the front rows are supposed to be for the earliest arrivals, and people in the back are expected to be behind. If the user is in the second row, maybe they should let people in front who need to see over them. So the answer might be A, the user is in the wrong. However, if the user got there early and deserves the spot, then B. \n\nI need to check common concert etiquette. From what I know, if you're in the front and you're tall, you're expected to let shorter people in front. So even if you got there early, you should let them in. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not doing that. So the answer would be A.\n"
