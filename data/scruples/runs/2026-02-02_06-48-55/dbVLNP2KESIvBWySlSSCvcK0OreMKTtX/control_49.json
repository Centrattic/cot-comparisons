She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is the asshole. The situation is about ditching a prom date, but there's a lot more context.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also wanted him to find a date for the daughter's friend, who is very short. The author asked his friend Luke, who is short and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. So, the author arranged both dates as a favor.\n\nNow, the problem starts at prom. Luke's date (the daughter's friend) is rude and makes fun of Luke's height during dinner. She also calls out the Chinese restaurant menu, which is inappropriate. The author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) joins in the teasing. Luke is clearly upset, and the author feels bad for him.\n\nThe author then decides to ditch the girls. He and Luke take them to the school parking lot and kick them out of the car, leading to the girls being very angry. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author set up the dates with the understanding that the girls might be problematic, as the cleaning lady had mentioned the ex was a bad influence. The girls' behavior was clearly disrespectful and cruel towards Luke. The author took action to stop the harassment, which could be seen as standing up against bullying.\n\nHowever, ditching them in the parking lot without a plan for them to get home might leave them stranded. Also, the author was supposed to be on a date with the cleaning lady's daughter, who participated in the teasing. By ditching her, he might have broken a promise and caused her distress.\n\nBut the key points are that the girls were acting in a way that was harmful to Luke, the author tried to protect his friend, and the cleaning lady later admitted her daughter's behavior was bad. The author's actions, while abrupt, were in response to the girls' harassment. The question is whether the means justified the ends. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or finding another solution, but his intention was to stop the bullying. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girls were at fault for their behavior. The author acted to protect his friend, which could be seen as justified. However, the method of ditching them without a plan might be questioned. But given the circumstances, and the fact that the cleaning lady acknowledged the problem, the author might not be the asshole. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
