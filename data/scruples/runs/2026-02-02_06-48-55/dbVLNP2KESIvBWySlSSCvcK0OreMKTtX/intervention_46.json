She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves a setup where the writer agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, and another friend (Luke) took the daughter's friend. The problem arises during dinner when the girls are being rude to Luke, especially about his height and the restaurant's food. The writer, along with Luke, decides to ditch the girls and leave them at the school parking lot, resulting in the girls being upset. The writer is now questioning if they were the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions taken. The girls were indeed mean to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The writer felt bad for Luke and took action to stop the abuse. However, ditching the dates is a drastic step. Prom is a significant event, and leaving them without a date could be considered a betrayal or a violation of trust. The cleaning lady had asked the writer to take her daughter, and the writer agreed, so there's an obligation there. Even though the girls were being unkind, the writer could have handled the situation differently, like confronting the girls directly, ending the date early politely, or not attending the prom together. Instead, they chose to abandon the dates in the parking lot, which could be seen as irresponsible and hurtful. The writer's actions led to the girls being embarrassed and upset, and while the girls were in the wrong for their behavior, the writer's response might be seen as overstepping. There's a balance between defending a friend and respecting commitments. The fact that the cleaning lady later apologized suggests she felt responsible, but the writer's decision to ditch the dates without a better alternative might still make them the asshole. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they broke their commitment to the dates despite the girls' behavior.\n"
