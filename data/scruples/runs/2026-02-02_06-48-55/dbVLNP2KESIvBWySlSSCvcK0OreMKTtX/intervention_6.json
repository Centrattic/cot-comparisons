She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person in the story set up a double date for his friend Luke and another girl, facilitated by the cleaning lady. The problem started when Luke's date was really rude to him, especially about his height, and even made a racist comment about the Chinese restaurant. The author and Luke then decided to ditch the girls at the school, leaving them without going to the prom. Now the question is whether the author did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, the context: the cleaning lady asked the author to help her daughter (who was left without a date after breaking up) by also finding a date for her friend, who was short. The author used his friend Luke, who is also short and struggling with dating. Luke's family is rich, so they provided the car. The girls acted inappropriately, which led to the author and Luke's decision to walk out.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author have the right to abandon the girls mid-prom? Was it within his right to make that decision based on their behavior? Or was it a breach of trust, especially since the author had prior agreements with the cleaning lady and the girls?\n\nThe girls were extremely disrespectful, including a racist comment. The author and Luke felt that Luke was being humiliated. The author apologized to the cleaning lady later, and she admitted her daughter and her friend were trashy. \n\nBut, from a legal or moral standpoint, even if the girls were rude, does the author have the right to leave them stranded? In some ways, the author was trying to protect his friend from further humiliation. However, abandoning them might have caused them to miss out on the prom, which could be seen as cruel or irresponsible. \n\nBut considering the girls' behavior, the author might feel justified in standing up for Luke and stopping the abuse. The author might have felt that continuing the evening would be harmful to Luke's emotional well-being. \n\nAnother point: the author didn't just leave them without any recourse. They gave the girls a chance to go to the dance on their own, rather than allowing the abuse to continue. However, they didn't give them the choice to maybe stop the behavior and continue, which could be seen as abrupt. \n\nThe cleaning lady was aware of the situation, and the author's actions led to her apologizing for her daughter's behavior. So maybe the author's intention was to put a stop to the negative behavior, which he succeeded in. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he took a stand against cruelty. On the other, he left the girls without attending the prom, which they were looking forward to. However, the girls' actions were inexcusable. The author might be justified in his decision given the circumstances. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he and his friend were protecting Luke from further emotional harm and stood up against the girls' disrespectful behavior. The girls' actions were the root of the problem, and the author's reaction was a form of defense and justice for Luke.\n"
