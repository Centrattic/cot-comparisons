She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about ditching a prom date after a bad experience. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The author was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend also needed a date, and the author found a friend, Luke, to go with the friend. The problem arises during the dinner when Luke's date is rude and makes fun of him for being short, and the author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) joins in. The author and Luke decide to ditch the girls, take them back to the school, and refuse to go to the dance. Now, the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I remember about social norms and personal responsibility, when you agree to take someone to an event like prom, you're entering into a commitment. Even if they behave badly, the appropriate response might be to address their behavior directly or leave the situation, but not necessarily abandon them. However, the girls were being extremely rude and disrespectful, especially towards Luke, which could justify the author's reaction. But does that make it acceptable to leave them stranded?\n\nThe key points here are: the author set up the dates, the girls' behavior was inappropriate, and the reaction was to ditch them. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and couldn't let the situation continue. But by ditching them, the author left them without a ride to prom, which is a significant event. Even if the girls deserved it, the act of abandoning them might be considered inconsiderate. The author might have taken responsibility for their own actions but not necessarily for Luke's date's behavior. \n\nAnother angle is that the author tried to warn them and give them a chance to act better, but instead of addressing the problem themselves, they decided to leave. However, the author might have felt that they had no other choice to protect Luke's feelings. The cleaning lady later apologized, so there's some acknowledgment of the daughter's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author tried to help out a friend and ended up in a bad situation. The decision to ditch them was a reaction to their poor behavior. But ethically, is it right to leave someone at the school parking lot during prom? That could be seen as a betrayal of the commitment made. Even if the girls were mean, the author might have had other options, like confronting them, ending the night early, or providing a ride back home but not abandoning them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were driven by standing up for Luke and protecting him from further humiliation. It's possible that the author felt they had no other choice in the moment. But the method of response\u2014abandoning them\u2014might be seen as harsh, even if justified by the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, there's a case to be made that the author acted out of self-defense for their friend but overstepped by not finding a better solution. However, the girls' behavior was extreme, and the author might not be entirely at fault. Still, the decision to ditch them without ensuring their safety or providing an alternative could be considered wrong. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation responsibly by leaving the girls stranded, even if the girls were rude.\n"
