She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date after a bad dinner experience.\n\nFirst, the author set up a double date with Luke to take two girls. The girls were mean to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The author and Luke decided to ditch them and didn't take them to the dance. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author's actions were a response to the girls' behavior. The girls were being disrespectful and cruel, especially to Luke, who was a friend. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and wanted to protect him from further humiliation. They confronted the girls and left them at the school, which was a direct consequence of their actions.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. The author had a duty to their friend Luke, who was being mistreated. By intervening, they were standing up for him. The girls' behavior was unacceptable, and the author's reaction was a form of self-defense and defense of a friend. However, ditching someone, even in response to their behavior, could be seen as a breach of trust or responsibility. The author was supposed to be their prom date, so abandoning them, even if justified, might have consequences like leaving the girls stranded or causing them distress.\n\nBut then again, the girls were not innocent here. They were the ones who started the harassment. The author's actions were a reaction to being wronged. It's a question of proportionality. The author didn't physically harm them but rather cut ties with them. The cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she acknowledged the girls' faults.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be the asshole because they were protecting their friend and standing up against bullying. The problem was the girls' behavior, not the author's response. Even though ditching them isn't ideal, the context of the mistreatment justifies it. The author's actions were a form of accountability for the girls' actions. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
