She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The daughter's friend also needed a date, so the author asked their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family. Luke agreed, and they went to a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe problem starts at the restaurant. Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height, and the author's date joins in. The menu incident where the girl calls the food \"Chink food\" adds to the tension. The author feels bad for Luke, and after an hour and a half of this behavior, they decide to ditch the girls and take them to the school instead, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls were upset, and the cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author set up a date for Luke, who was already in a vulnerable position (short, facing ridicule). The girls' behavior was unacceptable\u2014mocking Luke's height and using a racial slur. The author intervened to protect Luke, which could be seen as standing up for a friend. The cleaning lady was aware of her daughter's \"trasher\" nature, so maybe the author had a sense of what to expect but still went along. The author felt responsible for both girls, but when faced with harassment, they made a choice to leave. The cleaning lady did apologize later, implying some acknowledgment of the girls' behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author agreed to take both girls to prom, and by ditching them, they might have broken a promise. The girls were left stranded, which could be considered inconsiderate. However, the context of the harassment might mitigate that. The author's actions were to stop Luke from being humiliated further. It's a difficult situation where they prioritized their friend's well-being over fulfilling their commitment to the dates.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: There's no legal wrong here, but morally, it's a gray area. The author acted based on the immediate harm to Luke. The girls brought the harassment upon themselves, but the author had a responsibility to both dates. However, the situation escalated because of the girls' actions, which the author couldn't have fully anticipated, even if they knew the daughter's friend was short and potentially judgmental.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The author's decision to leave was to protect a friend from bullying and harassment. While it's not ideal to abandon someone, the context of the girls' behavior makes the author's actions more understandable. The cleaning lady's later apology also suggests that the author had good intentions and that the problem lay with the girls' behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not the asshole). The wrong actions were committed by the dates, not the author. The author was in a tough spot and made a tough call to protect their friend.\n"
