She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date and another friend at the restaurant. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, with the condition that he also find a date for the daughter's friend. The friend is short, 4'9\", so the author asked his shorter friend Luke, who is wealthy. Luke agreed, and they both took the girls to prom using Luke's family's car.\n\nAt the restaurant, Luke's date is extremely rude, making fun of his height and even using a derogatory term when they see the Chinese food. The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke, who's being tormented. After an hour and a half, the author and Luke decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls get angry and upset, and the cleaning lady later apologizes for her daughter's behavior.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the actions taken and the context. The author was set up by the cleaning lady, who knew her daughter and her friend had a history of being \"trashy.\" The girls' behavior was clearly unacceptable\u2014mocking Luke for his height, using a racial slur. The author and Luke decided to leave the girls stranded, which is a harsh response, but given the context, it might be justified.\n\nThe author had a responsibility to Luke, his friend, to protect him from being humiliated. The girls' behavior was beyond just being mean; it involved bigotry (the \"Chink food\" comment is a racial slur). The author took a stand against their bullying. However, ditching someone at prom is a significant social act, and the girls were left without a way to get to the dance. But considering their own behavior, was it fair for the author to do that?\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to stop the harassment. On the other hand, they didn't give the girls a chance to apologize or change their behavior. The cleaning lady did apologize later, which suggests she saw the girls' actions as wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent was to stop the bullying and protect his friend. The girls were the ones in the wrong for their behavior. The author's actions, while extreme, were a response to the girls' unacceptable conduct. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they stood up against the girls' mistreatment of Luke. However, there's a social expectation to handle such situations more gracefully. \n\nBut given the severity of the racial slur and the bullying, the author's decision to cut the girls off could be seen as justified. The author wasn't trying to harm the girls but to prevent further abuse. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that ditching them was too harsh regardless. But given the context, it's a defensive action.\n"
