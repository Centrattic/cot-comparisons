She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person (let's call them \"the author\") had a friend, the cleaning lady, who asked them to take her daughter to prom. But there's a catch: the daughter's friend also needed a date, and the cleaning lady mentioned the friend is really short. The author then asks their friend Luke, who's shorter, to be the date for the friend. Luke's family is wealthy and gives him a nice car. \n\nOn prom night, Luke's date is rude, making fun of Luke's height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch both girls, taking them to the school parking lot and kicking them out. The author feels guilty but is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. They set up Luke as a date because the friend is short, which might have led to the date's behavior. The author then decides to ditch the girls after they mistreated Luke. Was that justified?\n\nThe girls were being rude, especially with the racial slur. The restaurant was called China Palace, so the slur was inappropriate. The author stood up for Luke, which could be seen as protecting a friend. However, ditching people at a school parking lot might be seen as harsh and leaving them without a ride. \n\nBut the author had arranged the dates, partially responsible for the situation by matching Luke with the short girl who then acted out. The cleaning lady might have known her daughter's friends were problematic. The author's decision to remove the girls could be seen as a last resort to stop the harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to address the issue in a different way, like confronting the girls, paying for a taxi, or not taking them at all but letting them figure it out. Ditching them without a plan might leave them stranded, which is inconsiderate. But given the girls' behavior, the author might have felt justified in protecting Luke.\n\nThe key factors are the girls' harassment, the author's intent to help Luke, and the consequences of ditching them. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting a friend from bullying. However, they could be at fault for not considering the girls' safety or not providing an alternative. But since the behavior was so unacceptable, maybe it's justified. So the answer could be B (author not in the wrong). But I need to check again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because they set up the date knowing the friend's height, leading to the issue. Also, leaving them stranded might be a problem. However, the primary issue was the girls' behavior, so the author's actions were a reaction to that. The cleaning lady's role also plays a part here. The author might have been in a tough spot but acted in good faith.\n"
