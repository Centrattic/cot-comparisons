She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So the situation is about ditching prom dates. The user set up a date for his friend Luke and himself with the daughter of the cleaning lady and her friend. But then during dinner, the girls were really mean to Luke, making fun of his height and even calling out the restaurant's food. The user and Luke decided to ditch them and leave them at the school with no prom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The user was asked by his mother's cleaning lady to take the daughter to prom, and also help set up a date for her friend. He approached his friend Luke, who was shorter, but maybe not considering how that might play out. The girls were mean to Luke, which was really hurtful. The user felt bad for Luke and decided to stand up for him by leaving the girls.\n\nOn one hand, ditching someone at prom is a big deal. The girls probably expected to go to the dance, and the user and Luke left them without a date and no ride. The girls might have been in a bad situation, especially the cleaning lady's daughter, who the user was supposed to take to the prom. The user's mom's cleaning lady had a history with her daughter's ex being a bad influence, but here the daughter and her friend were the ones acting badly.\n\nBut on the other hand, the girls were being really rude and cruel to Luke, which is unacceptable. The user was trying to protect his friend from further humiliation. Luke was a good kid but maybe not confident about his height, and the girls were making him feel awful. The user's actions were in response to their bullying. \n\nSo, was the user wrong? If you set up a date and then leave them because they were mean to your friend, does that make you the asshole? Maybe the user should have tried to handle the situation differently, like talking to the girls directly or confronting them before ditching. But the level of cruelty from the girls might have justified the user's actions. The user also informed the cleaning lady, who apologized, so maybe she acknowledged the girls' behavior was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The user's intent was to protect his friend, which is noble, but the action of ditching them left the girls stranded. However, given the girls' behavior, their actions were inexcusable. The user might have been within his rights to stand up for his friend, even if it meant abandoning the date. \n\nBut in terms of social responsibility, ditching someone is usually frowned upon. However, the context here is that the dates were actively being cruel. So maybe the user isn't the asshole because he was responding to their bad behavior. The girls were the ones who acted inappropriately first. \n\nI think the answer here is B, because the user stood up against bullying and protected his friend, even though the method was extreme. The girls' behavior was inexcusable, so the user isn't entirely to blame.\n"
