She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about ditching prom dates after they were mean to the author's friend. The author set up dates for both the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The friend, Luke, was being bullied by the girls, and the author decided to cut the evening short.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior. The girls made fun of Luke, including a racist comment about Chinese food. The author felt responsible for dragging Luke into this and wanted to stop the mistreatment. They decided to ditch the girls, which led to the girls being upset, but the author's intention was to protect Luke.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Was the author justified? The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's action was to prevent further harm. However, ditching someone, even in response to mistreatment, isn't typically considered acceptable. It's abrupt and could be seen as a violation of the agreement to be their dates. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls or ending the date politely instead of abandoning them.\n\nBut then again, the author's friend was being treated poorly, and the author felt responsible. The cleaning lady apologized later, indicating she acknowledged the girls' behavior. The main question is whether the author's response was proportionate. While ditching them was harsh, the context of harassment might justify it. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might argue the author had the right to protect their friend, others might say they should have handled it another way. However, since the girls were the ones being mean, the author's actions were in self-defense and for Luke's sake. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. The act of ditching someone isn't right in general, but the circumstances could mitigate that. Hmm.\n"
