She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date after a bad experience with both dates.\n\nFirst, the author was set up by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, while also helping her friend Luke by getting a date for him. The dates turned out to be problematic. The friend's date made racist remarks about the restaurant and mocked Luke's height. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls, leading to a confrontation where they were kicked out of the car.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to ditch the dates, or was this an overreaction? The author's actions were in response to their dates' offensive behavior. The dates were making fun of Luke's height and using a racial slur. The author felt it was unacceptable and took action to stop the harassment. \n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as standing up against bullying and protecting their friend. They tried to address the issue when it was happening and then took decisive action when it continued. The mother later apologized, which suggests she acknowledged the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone mid-event can be seen as abandoning them, even if they were acting poorly. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls directly or ending the night politely. However, given the situation\u2014especially the racist comment and ongoing harassment\u2014it's understandable that they wanted to remove Luke from the toxic environment.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the dates were abusive and the mother later apologized, the author's decision might be seen as a reasonable self-defense against harassment. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But some might argue that ditching is still a breach of trust, even in bad circumstances. However, considering the context of the harassment, the author's actions were protecting their friend and themselves from further harm. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
