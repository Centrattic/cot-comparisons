She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author set up a prom date for two girls via their mother's cleaning lady. The author's friend Luke was to take one of the girls, who was short, but the date turned out to be problematic. The girls made fun of Luke's height, one insulted the restaurant's food, and eventually the author and Luke decided to ditch them at the school. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's correct. They want an answer A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's actions led to a plan to abandon the girls. The question is whether this was justified. \n\nThe key points: The girls were rude to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to leave. But was it okay to ditch them? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the girls were inconsiderate, the author's solution was to abandon them without a clear plan. They might have left the girls stranded. The cleaning lady's daughter's friend was also involved in the behavior, so the problem wasn't just one person. However, the author didn't confront the girls or try to resolve the issue; instead, they decided to leave abruptly, which could be seen as a hasty reaction. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they argue self-defense for Luke's emotional well-being. But abandoning the girls could leave them in a difficult situation. The cleaning lady was aware of her daughter's behavior, so maybe the author should have handled it differently, like calling the cleaning lady or the school. \n\nAlso, the author set up the date knowing one of the girls was short, and Luke was short too. Maybe that was a setup for teasing. The author might have overlooked potential issues by not considering how the girls would react to Luke's height.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girls' behavior was unacceptable, the author's solution was to abandon them. That could leave the girls in a worse situation. The author could have taken other steps, like leaving politely or contacting someone. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it responsibly.\n"
