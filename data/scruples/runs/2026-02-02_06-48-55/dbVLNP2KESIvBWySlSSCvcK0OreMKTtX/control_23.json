She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date after a bad experience. The situation involves two girls who were mean to the author's friend Luke. The author sets up a date for Luke and themselves with the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The friend's date is rude, even calling out Chinese food as \"Chink food,\" and both girls mock Luke's height. The author and Luke decide to ditch them at the school parking lot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girls were unkind to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant choice. The author tried to help Luke by setting up a date, but the dates were hostile. The author's action was to remove Luke from the situation to protect his feelings. \n\nNow, the ethical question is whether the author overstepped. The author's friend was being mistreated, and the author stepped in to stop it. However, ditching someone, even if they were being rude, could be seen as a violation of the agreement made with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady's daughter had a date with the author, but the author left them at the school. \n\nOn one hand, the author protected another person from bullying. On the other hand, they broke a promise to their date. The question is whether the action was justified. If the dates were being abusive and the author felt it was necessary to stop the harassment, maybe they had a valid reason. However, ditching someone could still be considered inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady was aware of her daughter's behavior, so maybe the author wasn't entirely to blame. The author's friend was being treated poorly, and the author acted to help. But the act of ditching the dates might not be justified regardless of the circumstances. There might be other ways to handle the situation without leaving them in the parking lot. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was to protect Luke, which is commendable, but the method of ditching the dates might be seen as wrong. However, given the extreme behavior of the dates, it's possible that the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the user is asking for a binary choice between A and B, I need to decide based on the most ethical standpoint. The author's action was in response to harassment, but they did breach a social contract. However, protecting someone from bullying is often seen as justified. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
