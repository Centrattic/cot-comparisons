She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for ditching their prom date and their friend's date. The key points to consider are the actions taken and the context.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author was asked by the cleaning lady to be a date for her daughter, who had recently broken up with a problematic boyfriend. The cleaning lady also wanted the author to help find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author approached their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the other date. Luke agreed, and they used his family's car for the prom night.\n\nNow, the problems start at the restaurant. Luke's date makes a derogatory comment about the restaurant being \"Chink food,\" and the daughter's friend is rude to Luke about his height. The daughter also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to confront the girls, leading to them all being ditched at the school parking lot with no plans to go to the dance.\n\nThe author's defense is that the girls were acting inappropriately, making fun of Luke's height and using a racial slur. The author and Luke took a stand against this behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the girls were clearly being disrespectful and rude. On the other hand, the author and Luke took a drastic action by ditching them, which left the girls stranded. The author might have a point in standing up for their friend, but they also went against the cleaning lady's request and possibly jeopardized the relationships with the cleaning lady and her daughter. \n\nHowever, considering the harassment Luke faced, the author's decision to protect their friend and end the night could be seen as justified. The author didn't just leave their own date but also Luke's, which might have been a mistake since they had responsibility towards both. But given the circumstances of abuse and disrespect, the action might be understandable.\n\nI need to weigh whether the ditching was an appropriate response. While the girls were in the wrong, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping by taking matters into their own hands. However, given the harassment, it could also be a justified stand against bullying. The answer isn't straightforward, but the author might not be the sole wrongdoer here. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the author's response left the girls without a prom night, which could reflect poorly on them. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to the girls' behavior, but they still chose to abandon the dates. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating some responsibility on her part for not foreseeing the situation. However, the author's decision to ditch them regardless of the consequences might make them partially at fault. But given the context of harassment, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they could have handled the situation differently, like confronting the girls directly or involving adults, instead of just leaving them stranded. However, if the harassment was severe, maybe B (not in the wrong) could be argued. But the act of ditching them without a clear plan to ensure their safety or well-being might tip it towards A.\n"
