She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves them ditching their prom date and a friend's date after the girl's friend was rude and made offensive comments. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom, and as part of that, the author arranged for their friend Luke to date the daughter's friend. The problem arose when Luke's date made fun of his height and used a racial slur at a Chinese restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch both girls, leading to the girls being upset and the cleaning lady apologizing later.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girls' behavior was inappropriate\u2014mocking Luke's height and using a derogatory term. The author felt they had to protect Luke from being humiliated. They took action by leaving the girls at the school, which was a drastic move. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, standing up against bullying and racism is understandable. The girls' actions were clearly hurtful and offensive. The author took responsibility for their friend's well-being. On the other hand, ditching someone at prom is a major betrayal. The author had a date that they agreed to take, and while the girls were awful, the author's response was to abandon them, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the author's main reason was protecting their friend from abuse. The story mentions that they even tried to warn the girls before the event about the friend's height, which the girls ignored. The girls then continued their behavior despite the warning. The author's action was in response to ongoing harassment, which might justify their actions. \n\nHowever, the author also agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. Even if the daughter's friend was problematic, the author's decision to leave both girls might have impacted the daughter negatively, even if she was complicit in the behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized, which shows she recognized the issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girls were in the wrong for their behavior, but the author's method of handling it might have been too extreme. However, considering the context\u2014standing up against racism and bullying\u2014their actions could be seen as justified. The key point is whether the author acted in self-defense against the girls' harassment or simply overstepped. Since the author took a stand for their friend and called out the offensive behavior, it's more about protecting others than being a jerk. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not the asshole) because they were responding to unacceptable treatment. But some might argue that ditching them was still wrong regardless of the circumstances. However, given the offensive nature of the girls' actions, the author's response is more about defending against abuse, so B is the likely choice.\n"
