She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, with the condition that he also find a date for the daughter's friend. The friend is very short. The author then asks his friend Luke, who's shorter, to be the date. \n\nOn prom day, they take the girls to a Chinese restaurant. The friend's date (the short girl) makes fun of Luke's height, and the daughter joins in. The menu comment about \"Chink food\" is a big issue here. The author and Luke then decide to drop the girls off at the school and leave them, causing a scene.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The girls were rude and disrespectful to Luke, which is clearly inappropriate. The author stood up for his friend, which is noble, but the action of ditching them might be seen as harsh. However, the girls initiated the bullying, and the author's response was to stop the mistreatment. \n\nThe cleaning lady had already warned about her daughter's boyfriend being a problematic person, so the author might have known the daughter could be difficult. The author's decision to leave was a direct response to the unacceptable behavior. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to self-respect. The author and Luke were not in the wrong for not accepting the girls' behavior. However, ditching them publicly could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she saw the wrong in her daughter's actions. The author's actions were a defense against bullying, which is generally not considered wrong. \n\nSo, weighing the situation, the author acted to protect his friend from harassment. The girls were in the wrong first. Therefore, the author is not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
