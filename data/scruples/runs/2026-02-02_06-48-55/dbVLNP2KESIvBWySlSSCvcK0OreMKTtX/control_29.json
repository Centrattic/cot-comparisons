She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for ditching his prom date. So, first, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author's story: He was asked by his mom's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and he also arranged for his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The problem arises when Luke's date is being a jerk, making fun of Luke for his height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls, leading to them being upset. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was to help out by setting up dates, but the dates ended up being unkind and disrespectful. The author felt responsible for his friend Luke and decided to stand up against the bullying. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author didn't force the girls to be nice, and they had the right to leave if they were being harassed. However, the author was acting as a date for the cleaning lady's daughter. By ditching her, even if her behavior was bad, maybe the author overstepped. But the daughter's actions were clearly inappropriate, and the author's decision might be seen as protecting his friend from further humiliation.\n\nBut then, was it his place to take such action when he wasn't the one being directly harassed? Luke was the one being targeted, so perhaps the author supported his friend's decision. However, the author's actions affected the cleaning lady's daughter, who might not be responsible for her friend's behavior. If the author had only confronted the friend, maybe that would be different. But he ditched both the daughter and her friend, which could be seen as punishing the wrong person if the daughter wasn't directly responsible.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to the girls' unacceptable behavior, but by taking it upon himself to eject them, he might have violated the trust of the cleaning lady and her daughter. However, his friend was being mistreated, and the author felt responsible for arranging the dates. It's a tough call. The girls were at fault, but the author's response might have been harsh. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the girls deserved what they got for their behavior, then maybe not. But if the author acted without considering the daughter's innocence, then he might be. The cleaning lady apologized, which might mean the daughter acknowledged the problem. So the author might not be the asshole because he stood up against bullying, but some might argue he overstepped.\n"
