She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves setting up dates for two girls through a cleaning lady. The key points here are the interactions during the dinner and the subsequent ditching.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Luke agreed to be a date for the cleaning lady's daughter's friend. The problem starts when Luke's date is rude to him, including making fun of his height and calling the restaurant food derogatory. The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls in the parking lot because of their behavior.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. The main issue is whether the author had the right to make that decision. The girls were being disrespectful, which is a valid concern. However, the author set up this arrangement without the full consent of the girls, which might be a problem. The cleaning lady asked the author to find a date for her daughter's friend, so the author took it upon themselves to pair Luke with the friend. But if the girls didn't know they were being paired, that could be an issue.\n\nThe ditching itself\u2014leaving the girls in the parking lot\u2014could be seen as a harsh reaction. However, the girls were making Luke uncomfortable, and the author and Luke decided to take a stand. The author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior, which was clearly inappropriate. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's trashy behavior, so maybe the author wasn't entirely at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to protect their friend from being mistreated, which shows empathy. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by orchestrating the dates in the first place without the girls' knowledge and then leaving them. But the main reason for ditching was the girls' poor behavior, so the author's actions were a response to that. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the girls were at fault for their actions. The author's decision to stand up for their friend is understandable, even if the method was a bit extreme.\n"
