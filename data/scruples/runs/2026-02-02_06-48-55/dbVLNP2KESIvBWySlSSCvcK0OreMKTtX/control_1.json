She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for ditching their prom date. The situation involves setting up a date for a friend, Luke, with the daughter of the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady's daughter and her friend were unkind to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant choice. The author and Luke then decided to ditch them at the school parking lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was asked to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, and he arranged for Luke to take her friend. The friend was short, and Luke was also short. The girls made fun of Luke's height and the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to end the date early, leading to the ditching.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are intent and proportionality. The author's intention was to protect his friend from further humiliation. The girls' behavior was indeed inappropriate and hurtful, which is a valid reason for the action taken. However, ditching someone, even in response to their behavior, can be considered a breach of trust or a violation of the social contract. But in this case, the girls initiated the negative behavior, and the author's response was a form of self-defense for his friend.\n\nAnother angle is the agreement made with the cleaning lady. The author had promised to take her daughter to prom, but due to the circumstances, he couldn't honor it. However, given the girls' conduct, it's understandable. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. This suggests that the author's actions were justified in that context.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. While ditching someone isn't ideal, the girls' actions were inexcusable. The author's decision was to prevent further harm to his friend. The response was proportional to the offense, considering the ongoing humiliation. Also, the author did warn them before the night started about possible issues, maybe implicitly through the cleaning lady's warnings about the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of social norms, leaving someone at a prom date could be seen as a faux pas, but the circumstances here were extreme. The girls' behavior was hostile, and the author took action to stop it. The key is whether the author had a reasonable justification for his actions. Since the girls were unkind and the author acted to protect his friend, it's more likely that the author isn't the asshole.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girls' behavior warranted the response, and the author acted to protect his friend from further harm.\n"
