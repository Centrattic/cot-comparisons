She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves setting up dates for two girls through the mother's cleaning lady. The main character (MC) arranged for his friend Luke to date the friend of the daughter, who is short. Then on prom night, Luke's date is rude, makes offensive comments about his height and the restaurant's food. The MC, along with Luke, decides to abandon the girls mid-event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. The MC had a responsibility to the girls he agreed to take, even if they were set up through someone else. By ditching them, he broke their prom plans. However, the girls' behavior was extremely unkind and offensive, especially targeting Luke's height and the restaurant. The MC felt it was unacceptable and took action to stop the harassment. \n\nIs the MC in the wrong? On one hand, he didn't have the right to decide to ditch them without their consent. On the other hand, he was protecting his friend from bullying. But was there a better way to handle it? Maybe confronting them first or reporting the behavior instead of leaving abruptly. The MC's actions were a reaction to the girls' mistreatment of his friend, which could be seen as justified in some contexts. However, the decision to abandon them might be seen as taking it too far, causing additional harm or inconvenience. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, so the MC's actions might have been a necessary intervention. But legally and socially, is ditching someone during an event, even in response to their behavior, acceptable? It's a tricky balance between standing up against bullying and respecting agreements. The MC might be seen as standing up for a friend, but also violating trust. So, there are arguments both ways. The key is whether the response was proportionate. Since the girls were actively humiliating Luke, the MC's decision could be seen as protecting his friend, thus not entirely in the wrong. However, the abruptness of the action without giving them a chance to change their behavior might tip the scales. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the girls' actions were unacceptable and the MC was defending his friend, even if the method was harsh.\n"
