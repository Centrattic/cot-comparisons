She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date after a bad experience. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. There was also a friend who needed a date, so the author set up his friend Luke to go with the daughter's friend. The problem arose when Luke's date was rude, making fun of his height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls after they were being mean.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girls' behavior was inappropriate, the author stood up for his friend, and they left the girls at the school. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the author is in the wrong (A), maybe because he didn't have the right to abandon them, but if he's not (B), because the girls were being jerks. \n\nI need to think about the ethics here. The girls were disrespectful and targeted Luke. The author's actions were in response to their bad behavior. But was ditching them the right choice? Maybe there's a better way, but given the circumstances, he was protecting his friend. The cleaning lady apologized, so maybe she acknowledges the girls' fault. \n\nSo the author's intentions were good, but the action of ditching them might be harsh. However, given the girls' behavior, it's a justified response. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but the answer could be B. Hmm. The question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girls acted badly, then the author is defending his friend. So, the answer might be B (not the asshole). But I need to be careful. The question is about ditching the prom date, which is a breach of social contract. But the context is important. The girls were unkind, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
