She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves the author setting up a date for their friend Luke with the daughter's friend, who turns out to be a jerk. The girls are mean to Luke during dinner, making fun of his height and the restaurant choice. The author and Luke then decide to abandon the girls and leave them at the school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also mentioned the daughter's friend needed a date, so the author arranged Luke, who is shorter, to date the friend. The girls then mistreated Luke during dinner, leading the author to cut the date short.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about their intentions. The author set up the date because the cleaning lady asked, and they wanted to help. When the girls acted poorly, the author tried to protect Luke, who was being bullied. The decision to leave was made to stop the harassment. The author even apologized to the cleaning lady later.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone at prom is a big deal. The girls might have felt abandoned, and the author did leave without a clear alternative. However, the girls' behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, so the author's actions could be seen as standing up for Luke.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing the wrong actions of the girls against the author's response. The author's main issue was defending Luke from bullying, which is understandable. They didn't confront the girls directly but removed themselves from the situation. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating some validation.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't necessarily the asshole. They acted to protect a friend from mistreatment. The answer is probably B (not wrong), but I should check if there's a better angle. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls instead of abandoning them. But the main wrongdoers were the girls. The author's intent was to help, not to harm. So B makes sense.\n"
