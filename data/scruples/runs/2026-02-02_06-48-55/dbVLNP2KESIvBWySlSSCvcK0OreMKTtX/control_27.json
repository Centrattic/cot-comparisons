She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date and another girl after a bad experience.\n\nFirst, the author agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, and also set up a date for the daughter's friend with his friend Luke. The problem arises when Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height and the restaurant's menu. The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls mid-prom.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main action was abandoning the girls after they were disrespectful. Was this justified? Well, the girls' behavior was clearly unkind and hurtful. Teasing someone about their height and making derogatory comments about the restaurant's food (like calling it \"Chink food\") is unacceptable. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and intervened when the girls' actions were causing distress.\n\nHowever, the author had agreed to take them to prom. By bailing on them, even if it was to protect Luke, did they break a commitment? The girls might have felt they were let down. But the author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior. Also, the cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she recognized the problem with her daughter's actions.\n\nSo, while ditching someone is generally not a good idea, in this context, the girls were being cruel. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or not going along with the date setup. But once the events happened, removing themselves and Luke from the situation could be seen as standing up against bullying. The author's intent was to protect a friend, which is commendable. Therefore, it's a bit of a nuanced case. On one hand, they broke a commitment, but on the other, they prevented further harm to Luke. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because their actions were in response to the girls' misconduct.\n"
