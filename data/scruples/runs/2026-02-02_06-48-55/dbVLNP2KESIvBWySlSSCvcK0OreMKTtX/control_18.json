She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. So, first, the context: the author was set up with a prom date through their mother's cleaning lady. The setup involved another friend, Luke, who was short and wealthy, and his date. The problem arose when Luke's date was being rude about his height and made a derogatory comment about the Chinese restaurant. The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The key points here are the behavior of the dates. The dates were making fun of Luke's height, which is a personal attack. The restaurant comment was also offensive. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and decided to protect him by removing him from the situation. They took action by leaving the girls at the school, which was a drastic move but in response to the harassment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't know the dates would act that way. They tried to find a good solution by getting dates for the girls, showing they had good intentions. When the dates behaved poorly, the author stood up for Luke. While ditching someone isn't ideal, the context is important. The author's actions were a response to harassment, not just a random decision. The cleaning lady even apologized later, acknowledging the girls' behavior. So, the author's intentions were to protect their friend, which is understandable. They might have handled it differently, but the core issue is the dates' behavior. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
