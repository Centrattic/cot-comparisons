She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date and a friend's date after they were mean to him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also to find a date for the daughter's friend, who is short. The writer asked his friend Luke, who is shorter, to be the date. Then, during dinner, Luke's date and the cleaning lady's daughter were making fun of Luke's height and the food. The writer felt bad for Luke, so they decided to ditch the girls and drive them to the school instead, telling them they wouldn't go to the dance. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. \n\nOn one hand, the girls were being disrespectful, which is clearly wrong. The writer was defending his friend and stood up against their bullying. That seems like a positive action. But on the other hand, ditching someone at prom is not a typical response. The writer made a decision that caused the girls to be stranded, which could be seen as punitive, but perhaps justified given the circumstances. \n\nHowever, the writer was acting as a date, so he had a responsibility to his date. By ditching her, he may have broken their agreement. Also, even if the girls were acting poorly, the writer could have handled it differently, like confronting them politely or ending the date politely instead of abandoning them. But considering the emotional harm Luke was experiencing, the writer's actions might be seen as protecting his friend. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she acknowledged the girls' behavior. The writer's actions might be seen as a justified response to protect his friend from further humiliation. However, leaving the date without a proper resolution could still be problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that he stood up against bullying and protected his friend, maybe not. But if we consider the act of ditching the date, perhaps he is. But the key here is that the date was arranged with the cleaning lady's request, and the girls were the ones being rude. The writer's responsibility was to both his date and his friend. However, the main issue is the dates being mean. The writer made a split-second decision to protect his friend, which might be excused given the context. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have found another way to handle the situation without abandoning the girls. But considering the emotional state of Luke and the immediate actions to stop the bullying, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because he was protecting his friend from bullying, even though the method was extreme. The girls' behavior was inexcusable, so his response, while harsh, was a reaction to their actions.\n"
