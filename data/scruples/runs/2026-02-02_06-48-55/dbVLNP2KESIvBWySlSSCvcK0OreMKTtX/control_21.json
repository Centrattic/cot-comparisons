She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ditching their prom date. So, the situation is they were set up by their mom's cleaning lady. The cleaning lady's daughter needed a date, and the daughter's friend also needed one. They arranged for their friend Luke to go with the friend. The user ended up taking the daughter.\n\nOn prom day, they go to Chinese restaurant. The user's date (the daughter) and her friend (Luke's date) act really poorly. The friend makes fun of Luke's height and calls the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The user, seeing Luke being bullied, decides to ditch the girls, leave them at school, and end the date.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's look at the facts. The user was set up by someone else, not their own idea. The girls were acting inappropriately towards Luke, including racist comments and bullying. The user stood up for Luke, which seems like the right thing to do. The user didn't go to the dance with them because of their behavior, which is understandable. The cleaning lady even apologized later.\n\nBut was ditching them the right move? Well, the user confronted the girls, tried to end the bad behavior, and then left them at the school. While it's a harsh action, the user was protecting Luke from further humiliation. The girls were the ones making the offensive remarks. The user's actions were a response to the girls' behavior, not just a random ditching. \n\nPossible angles: Did the user have a responsibility to their date? They were set up as a favor, maybe not a romantic date. The user's date was part of a setup, so maybe the user didn't have a personal connection. The user's main issue was standing up for Luke. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is being harassed or bullied, standing up for them is generally seen as right. However, taking action by ditching them without a clear solution might be seen as extreme. But given the racism and bullying involved, the user's actions were a response to unacceptable behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she agreed the girls were at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't the asshole. They acted to stop the abuse against their friend. The answer is B.\n"
