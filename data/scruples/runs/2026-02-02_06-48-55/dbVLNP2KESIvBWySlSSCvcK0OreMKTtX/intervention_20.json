She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves the author setting up two dates for the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The dates went bad because the girl was mean to Luke, and the friend even said \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke decided to abandon the girls at the school parking lot, which caused a lot of embarrassment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's actions: they set up a date for the cleaning lady's daughter, possibly to help out. However, when the dates became hostile, especially with a racist comment, the author decided to leave, which might be seen as a justified response to protect their friend. But ditching someone, even if they were being mean, could be considered harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate. The racist slur is a major issue here. The author and Luke were victims of both harassment and racism. The decision to leave might have been a way to stand up against that behavior. However, the author had a responsibility since they were set up by the cleaning lady, so leaving them stranded could have been a breach of their agreement. \n\nBut considering the context, the girls were acting in a way that was hurtful and disrespectful. The author felt it necessary to protect their friend and not tolerate such behavior. It's a tough call. The key points are the girls' misconduct and the author's response. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intentions. The author's intention was to help, but the girls' actions led to a conflict. The author's response, while harsh, might be seen as a stand against bullying and racism. However, ditching someone can be seen as abandoning them, which could be wrong regardless of the circumstances. \n\nBut given the severity of the racist comment and the ongoing harassment, the author's decision might be viewed as justified. The answer might be B (not wrong) because they stood up against mistreatment. However, some might argue that they had a responsibility to see the arrangement through, even if the girls were mean. But in reality, the author wasn't obligated to continue if the girls were being abusive. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their friend and rejecting the girls' harmful behavior. The racist comment is a significant factor here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
