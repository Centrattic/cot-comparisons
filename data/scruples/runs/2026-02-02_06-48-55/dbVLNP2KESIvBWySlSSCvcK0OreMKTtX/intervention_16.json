She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and also wanted him to set up a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author asked his friend Luke, who's nice but shorter and from a wealthy family. They all went to a Chinese restaurant, but Luke's date was rude about his height, and the author's date joined in. At the restaurant, Luke's date even called out the Chinese food, which was awkward. After a while, the author and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school, leading to the girls being upset. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know more. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, let's break it down. The author set up dates for two girls, but the dates ended up being problematic. The key points here are that Luke was treated poorly by the girls, and the author decided to leave them at the school. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. Luke was a good-natured person, and he was being mocked for his height and other issues. The author felt responsible for his friend's treatment and decided to take action. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to leave someone stranded at a school parking lot? Well, the girls were acting inappropriately, and Luke was clearly upset. The author tried to stand up for his friend, which could be seen as a positive action. However, leaving them without a way to get to the dance might be considered a harsh response. \n\nBut then again, the girls were the ones who were being unkind. The author might have felt that the girls' behavior was unacceptable and that they deserved the consequences. The fact that the cleaning lady apologized later suggests that she acknowledged the girls' behavior was wrong. \n\nThe author didn't just walk out; he discussed it with Luke and made a plan. This shows that they were trying to protect Luke from further humiliation. The girls were aware of their actions and were the ones who reacted negatively. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently, like confronting the girls directly or finding another solution instead of ditching them. But considering the emotional state of Luke and the author's discomfort, maybe they felt it was the only option.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? The author took a stand against bullying, which is commendable. However, the action of abandoning them might be seen as excessive. But given the context, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author's actions were justified in response to the girls' behavior. Since the girls were the ones being cruel, the author might not be the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were protecting their friend from being mistreated, even if the method was extreme. The cleaning lady's apology also indicates that the girls' actions were the problem, not the author's response.\n"
