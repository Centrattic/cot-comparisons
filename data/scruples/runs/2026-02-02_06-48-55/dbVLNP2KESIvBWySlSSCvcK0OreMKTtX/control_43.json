She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for ditching their prom date. The story is about setting up a date for a cleaning lady's daughter and her friend by involving a friend, Luke. \n\nFirst, the setup: the cleaning lady asks the author to take her daughter to prom, and also needs a date for her daughter's friend. The author suggests their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family. Luke agrees.\n\nOn prom night, they all go to a Chinese restaurant. Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height, and his menu comment about \"Chink food\" adds to the tension. The author's date also laughs along. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls, taking them to the school and kicking them out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in doing this. Let's analyze the key points:\n\n1. **Intentions and Planning**: The author didn't plan to ditch the girls from the start. They set up the date as a favor to the cleaning lady. The problem arose during the event due to the girls' behavior. The author tried to warn Luke beforehand, but the situation escalated.\n\n2. **Girls' Behavior**: The dates were making fun of Luke, using derogatory terms, and being disrespectful. The menu comment was especially offensive. The author couldn't control the girls' actions, but they did try to intervene when they saw Luke being treated poorly.\n\n3. **Author's Response**: The author decided to end the date abruptly to protect Luke from further humiliation. While ditching someone is usually considered rude, the context here is different because the girls were being cruel. The author's action was a reaction to unacceptable behavior, not just a last-minute decision to leave a date.\n\n4. **Aftermath**: The cleaning lady apologized later, acknowledging the girls' trashy behavior. This suggests that the author's decision was justified in the eyes of at least one adult involved.\n\n5. **Responsibility**: The author isn't the one who made the offensive comments or organized the dates for mockery. They were trying to be a good friend and stepped in to stop their friend from being bullied. However, they did set up the date without fully considering how the girls might react to Luke's height, which could be a point of self-criticism.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable behavior. While ditching a date is usually frowned upon, the context here is more about protecting a friend from harassment. The author isn't the one who started the bullying, so it's less clear that they're the asshole. They tried to handle it respectfully by confronting the girls before kicking them out. So, the answer would be B (not the asshole).\n"
