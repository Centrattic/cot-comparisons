She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is the asshole for ditching their prom date. So I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take the daughter to prom. Then the cleaning lady also wanted him to find another date for the daughter's friend, who's really short. The author convinced his friend Luke to go along, even though Luke wasn't really into it. Luke's family is wealthy and let him use their Lincoln Navigator.\n\nAt the restaurant, the dates are being mean to Luke. The friend's date called the restaurant \"Chink food\" and made fun of Luke's height. The author's date also joined in. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them. They took the girls to the school, told them they wouldn't go to the dance because of their behavior, and kicked them out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author set up this arrangement where Luke was supposed to date the short friend. Luke was a nice guy but maybe not confident because of his height. The dates were hostile, making fun of Luke and using racially insensitive language. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and decided to stand up against the girls' behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the author and Luke did what they thought was right to protect Luke from being harassed. The girls' actions were clearly inappropriate. The author tried to address it by confronting them and then taking action. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that she recognized the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone on prom night is a big deal. The author did promise to take the girl to prom, and even though the girls were being awful, the author had a responsibility to honor that commitment. However, the girls' behavior was so offensive that it could be seen as a legitimate reason to end the date. The author made a judgment call to protect his friend and himself from a toxic situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors: The girls were in the wrong for their behavior. The author tried to mediate but when that failed, they chose to leave. The cleaning lady acknowledged the problem. The author isn't the asshole here because he stood up against bullying and protected his friend. The decision, while harsh, was justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
