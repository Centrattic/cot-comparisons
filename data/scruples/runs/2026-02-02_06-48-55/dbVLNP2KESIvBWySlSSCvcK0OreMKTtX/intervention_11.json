She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about ditching a prom date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also find a date for the daughter's friend. The friend is short, so they find Luke, a friend who is also shorter. They set up a date with two girls. On prom night, Luke's date is rude about his height, and the author's date joins in. The menu comment is also a big issue. The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, leading to the girls being upset. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set up a date with two girls who were unkind to Luke. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to leave them at the school. The question is whether ditching them was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the girls were being disrespectful and cruel, which is definitely not okay. The author tried to help Luke by ending the date early. However, ditching someone, even if they were being mean, is generally considered inconsiderate. The author left them without a ride to the dance, which could have left them stranded, even if they were acting poorly. The cleaning lady had already apologized later, but the act of leaving them at the school might have been a hasty decision. The author might have considered other options, like ending the evening politely or contacting someone else to help them get to the dance. Ditching them could be seen as an overreaction, even if the girls were rude. So, the author might be in the wrong for abandoning them, regardless of the girls' behavior. Alternatively, if the girls were being extremely disrespectful, some might argue the author had the right to leave. But generally, ditching someone is seen as a breach of social conduct, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
