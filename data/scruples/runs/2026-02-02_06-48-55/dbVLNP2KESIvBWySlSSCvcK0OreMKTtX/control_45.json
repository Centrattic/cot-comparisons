She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author's mother's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. The daughter's friend also needed a date, and the cleaning lady mentioned she was very short. The author asked his friend Luke, who is shorter but nice, to go along. They all went to a Chinese restaurant, but the dates were being rude to Luke\u2014mocking his height and the restaurant's food. The author felt bad for Luke, so they decided to ditch the girls and drive them back to the school, refusing to take them to the dance. The cleaning lady apologized later.\n\nSo, what's the question here? Is the author in the wrong for ditching them?\n\nLet me think about the key points. The author didn't set up the dates to harm them. The girls were clearly being cruel to Luke, which is unacceptable. The author stood up for his friend, which is a positive action. However, ditching someone at a school parking lot might be legally and ethically questionable. Did they have permission to do that? Probably not. Also, the author was a minor, so their actions might be seen as impulsive but with good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls' behavior was inconsiderate and harmful. The author's motivation was to stop the bullying, which is understandable. But the method of ditching them could be seen as harsh. However, given the context of the girls' actions, maybe the author's reaction is justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author was following the cleaning lady's request but ended up in a bad situation. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. The author's actions were a response to being mistreated, which could mitigate blame. \n\nBut legally, you can't just abandon someone on the side of the road. However, in a school parking lot, maybe the girls could walk back. Plus, the author was trying to protect his friend's feelings and stop the harassment. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions were a reaction to the girls' misconduct. While ditching them might not be the best approach, the intent was to stop the bullying. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The main issue was the girls' behavior, not the author's response to protect his friend.\n"
