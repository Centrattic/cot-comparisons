She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after ditching their prom date. So, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom because her ex was a problem. The cleaning lady also wanted him to find another date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author approached his friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. Luke agreed.\n\nThen, on prom day, they all go to a Chinese restaurant. The friend's date is rude, making fun of Luke's height and even calling out the food. The author's date also joins in. The situation gets uncomfortable for Luke, and the author, feeling bad, decides to ditch the girls after the dinner. They take them to the school, tell them not to go to the dance, and kick them out of the car. The girls get angry, and the cleaning lady later apologizes to the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author set up this arrangement where Luke would be the date for the short friend. The problem arises when the friend and her date are extremely rude to Luke. The author, seeing Luke being harassed, takes action. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's height and using derogatory language (like \"Chink food\") is bullying. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and decided to stop the abuse. However, ditching someone at a school parking lot could be seen as a harsh response. But considering the context, the girls were being cruel, and the author was trying to protect his friend.\n\nThe cleaning lady had a role in setting up this situation, possibly not considering the friend's attitude. The author didn't force the girls to go along with it; they were volunteers, but their behavior was unacceptable. The author's actions were in defense of Luke's dignity and to stop the bullying. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? The key points are the girls' misconduct, the intent to protect Luke, and the lack of prior agreements that would obligate the author to take them to the dance. The author might not be in the wrong because he acted to prevent further harm to Luke. The decision to leave was a response to the girls' behavior, not just a spontaneous ditching. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
