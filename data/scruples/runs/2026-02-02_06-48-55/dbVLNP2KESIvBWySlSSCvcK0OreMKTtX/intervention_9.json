She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ditching their prom date and a friend's date after a bad experience. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and also asked if he could find a date for the daughter's friend. The author asked his friend Luke, who was shorter, to do that. The problem starts when Luke's date is rude, especially about his height, and even calls the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke get fed up, take the girls to the school parking lot, and ditch them.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and the consequences. The author invited Luke knowing the friend was short, but maybe didn't consider the potential for teasing. However, when the girls acted out, the author took action to stop the harassment. But the question is whether this action was justified.\n\nLegally, you can't just abandon someone, especially if they were under the impression they were going to prom. The author and Luke essentially left them stranded, which is a problem. Also, the cleaning lady might have expected the dates to stay for the event. \n\nEthically, while the girls' behavior was awful, the response was to leave them, which could be seen as a violation of their agreement. However, the author was protecting their friend from further harm. But the method of response\u2014abandoning them in a parking lot\u2014might be excessive. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the harassment, which is understandable. But by not finding another solution, like ending their participation without ditching the girls, maybe they could have handled it better. The cleaning lady did apologize, so maybe she took responsibility. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author had good intentions but their action of ditching the girls was a breach of their commitment. They could have handled it differently, like contacting the girls' parents or not going further with the date. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow through on the agreement, even if the girls were awful. But some might argue it was justified given the situation. However, the act of abandoning them is problematic.\n"
