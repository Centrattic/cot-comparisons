She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was asked by his mom's cleaning lady to be a prom date for her daughter, and also to find someone for the daughter's friend. He asked his friend Luke, who agreed. Then, during the restaurant meal, Luke's date (the friend) is being a jerk, making fun of Luke's height and the food. Both the friend and the cleaning lady's daughter are involved in this teasing. The author and Luke decide to ditch them at the school, leading to the girls being upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author didn't know the friend was going to be so rude. He set up the date based on the cleaning lady's request. The friend was a problem from the start, like calling the food \"Chink food\" and making fun of Luke. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to take action to stop the harassment. \n\nBut was it right to ditch them? The girls were being mean, but was there a better way to handle it? Maybe confronting them first instead of immediately leaving? However, the author might not have felt comfortable doing that in the moment. Also, the cleaning lady had agreed to the arrangement, but she didn't know about the behavior of her daughter's friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did inform the cleaning lady about what happened, and she apologized. So perhaps he took responsibility. The main issue is whether he overstepped by leaving abruptly and cutting them off. Prom is a big event, and the girls were left without dates. But they were also acting in a way that was hurtful. The author might have handled it out of loyalty to his friend and to stop the bullying. \n\nIt's a bit of a tricky situation. If the girls were being intentionally mean, maybe the author was justified in protecting his friend. But ditching someone on prom day could be seen as harsh, even if they were rude. The key is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the harassment his friend was experiencing. \n\nSo, considering that the girls were being disrespectful and the author acted to prevent further harm to his friend, but left them without going to prom. Is leaving them without a date the right call? There's no easy answer. If he had a choice to either let the situation continue or cut it off, maybe he did the right thing. But maybe he should have tried to talk to the girls first or find another solution. However, given the severity of the comments, especially about race (calling the food \"Chink food\") and height, the author and Luke might have felt it was necessary to leave immediately to avoid further conflict or hurt. \n\nIn the end, the cleaning lady acknowledged the daughter's behavior was bad, so he might have done the right thing. But the act of ditching them without giving them a chance to apologize could be problematic. Still, in the context of the girls' behavior, perhaps it's understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he stood up against harassment, even though the method was abrupt.\n"
