She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They're asking for a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to be a prom date for the cleaning lady's daughter. The cleaning lady also wanted the author to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author asked their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family. \n\nOn prom night, they all go to a Chinese restaurant. Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls, taking them to the school instead and kicking them out. The next day, the cleaning lady apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author set up the dates based on the cleaning lady's request. The problem arose when the dates were unkind to Luke. The author and Luke decided to leave, which caused the girls to be stranded. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were protecting their friend from bullying and humiliation. They stood up for Luke, which is commendable. However, the method they used was to abandon the girls without a prom date. Was that justified? The girls were disrespectful, but did the author have the right to take that action?\n\nConsider the responsibilities. The author agreed to take the daughter to prom, so there's an obligation to see it through. By ditching them, the author didn't fulfill that agreement. However, the girls were unkind, and the author felt it was necessary to stop the abuse. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author should have handled it differently. For example, confronting the girls directly, not involving Luke in the decision, or reporting the behavior to someone else. Abandoning the girls might have been an overreaction, even if the girls were rude. \n\nAlso, the cleaning lady was aware of her daughter's behavior and apologized later, which suggests she didn't condone it. The author's actions might have been a way to protect Luke, but the girls were left in a bad situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to punish someone for their behavior by leaving them stranded? The author might not be the asshole because they were defending their friend from bullying, but they could have handled it more responsibly. However, the act of ditching the girls without ensuring they had alternative transportation might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were minors. \n\nOn the other hand, the girls were the ones being rude. The author might have a valid reason to remove himself and his friend from a toxic environment. The key is whether the response was proportionate. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were standing up against bullying. Their actions were a reaction to the girls' unacceptable behavior. However, they could have found a better solution, like leaving immediately instead of waiting to drop them off at school. But given the circumstances, their decision to protect Luke was justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
