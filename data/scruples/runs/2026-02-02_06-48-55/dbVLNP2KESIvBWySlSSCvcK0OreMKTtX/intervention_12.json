She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe story is about someone who agreed to take the daughter of their mother's cleaning lady to prom. The cleaning lady also asked the person to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's really short. They found a friend named Luke, who's nice but shorter, and from a wealthy family. Luke lends his new Lincoln Navigator for the prom night.\n\nAt the Chinese restaurant, Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height and even calling the food \"Chink food.\" The main character's date joins in. The main character feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls by taking them to the school and letting them out there instead of going to the dance.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologizes to the main character for her daughter's behavior.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about the answer. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider whether their actions were justified. The key points are:\n\n1. The main character set up Luke as a date for the cleaning lady's daughter's friend. Luke was a good kid but of shorter height.\n2. The dates (both the daughter and her friend) were rude and derogatory towards Luke, especially the friend with the slur about the Chinese restaurant.\n3. The main character decided to ditch the girls because of their behavior towards Luke, which they found unacceptable.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives: The main character had a duty to both their friend Luke and the cleaning lady's daughter. However, they witnessed the girls being mean and derogatory. In such a scenario, standing up against bullying or harmful behavior is often seen as the right thing to do. The main character intervened to protect Luke from being humiliated further, which is a moral action.\n\nHowever, the main character did abandon their date. The question is whether that's justified. If the date was abusive or harmful, then perhaps it's understandable. The main character wasn't responsible for the girls' behavior, but they took responsibility for the situation they set up. They tried to make things right by confronting the girls and leaving them stranded, which might be seen as a harsh but justified response given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: the main character might have been overstepping by taking such an action. Maybe they should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls immediately or contacting the cleaning lady. But given that the cleaning lady had already warned about the daughter's friend's behavior, and the main character saw firsthand the friend's racism and cruelty, their decision to protect Luke could be seen as necessary.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the main character's primary motivation was to stop the abuse. The girls were the ones with the inappropriate behavior. So, the main character isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
