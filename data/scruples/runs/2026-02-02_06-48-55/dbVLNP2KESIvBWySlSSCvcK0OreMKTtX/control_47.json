She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author (let's call him AITA) had a cleaning lady who was a friend. When AITA's prom approached, the cleaning lady's daughter needed a date because her ex was a problem. The cleaning lady asked AITA to take her daughter and also her daughter's short friend. AITA approached his friend Luke, who's rich but shorter, to be the date for the friend. They arranged to take both girls to prom in Luke's family's fancy car.\n\nAt the Chinese restaurant, Luke's date made fun of him for his height, and the other girl (AITA's date) joined in. There was also a racist comment about the restaurant being \"Chink food.\" After enduring this, AITA and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, causing them to miss the prom. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether AITA is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the actions. The girls were being disrespectful towards Luke and made a racist comment. AITA felt it was unacceptable and decided to leave them. Was this a justified response? On one hand, standing up against bullying and racism is important. On the other hand, preventing someone from attending their prom could have serious consequences, especially if the girls were unaware of their transgressions or if there were other factors.\n\nAITA's responsibility comes into play here. He had a role in setting up the dates, knowing the friend was short. He might have anticipated some teasing, but the racist comment was a separate issue. However, the decision to ditch them was a drastic measure. Was there a better way to handle the situation, like confronting the girls directly or not participating in the setup?\n\nThe cleaning lady's daughter and her friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate. However, AITA and Luke's response was to cut them off entirely, which could be seen as a form of punishment. It's possible that the girls learned a lesson, but it's also possible they felt wronged. The key point here is whether AITA's actions were proportionate to the situation.\n\nIn terms of morality, defending someone from bullying and racism is commendable, but the method of response matters. Ditching them led to a loss of the prom experience for the girls. If AITA had other options, like leaving the restaurant and ending the date early without involving Luke, maybe that would have been better. However, given that Luke was also a participant, their joint decision complicates things.\n\nThe aftermath shows that the cleaning lady apologized, so she admitted fault. That might indicate that AITA's actions were justified in her eyes. But the question is about whether AITA is the asshole, not the girls or the cleaning lady.\n\nConsidering all factors, AITA acted to protect his friend from harassment and racism. While ditching the girls was harsh, it was a response to their unacceptable behavior. Therefore, AITA might not be in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. He could have handled it differently, but the core issue is the girls' behavior. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
