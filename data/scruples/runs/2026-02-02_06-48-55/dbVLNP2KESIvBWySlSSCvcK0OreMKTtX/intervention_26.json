She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching their prom date and a friend's date because the dates were being jerks.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. She also had a friend who needed a date, so he asked his friend Luke. Luke was shorter and from a rich family. On prom night, Luke's date was rude, making fun of his height, and even called the restaurant's Chinese food an insult. The other girl joined in. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to take them to the school, kick them out of the car, and leave. The girls were upset, and the cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know the community's take. So, the answer is either A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider if ditching the dates was justified. The girls were being mean and disrespectful, especially towards Luke. The author acted to protect his friend, which could be seen as standing up against bullying. However, ditching them might have been a harsh reaction. The cleaning lady had warned about the daughter's ex being a problem, but she didn't mention the friends' behavior. The author might have thought he was helping but ended up causing a bigger issue.\n\nOn one hand, the girls' behavior was unacceptable\u2014mocking someone's height and making racial slurs (even if \"Chink food\" is a slur). On the other hand, the author and Luke decided to leave abruptly without resolving the situation calmly. They could have handled it differently, like speaking to the girls directly or ending the night politely instead of confrontation.\n\nThe key points are the girls' inappropriate behavior and the author's response. While the girls were in the wrong, the author's method of leaving might have been too abrupt and unprofessional, leading to potential embarrassment. But considering the context, the author might have been trying to protect his friend from further humiliation. However, ditching them entirely could be seen as taking a stand against bullying. But maybe there was a more appropriate way to handle it. The cleaning lady's subsequent apology shows she acknowledged her daughter's behavior, so the author might not be entirely at fault.\n\nStill, the act of kicking them out of the car and leaving them in the parking lot could be seen as going too far, even if provoked. The author could have taken other steps, like ending the night politely or not attending the prom together. The decision to ditch them in the middle of the night without a plan for their safety might be problematic. So, the author's actions, while understandable in the moment, might be considered inconsiderate or harsh, making him the asshole despite the girls' behavior. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
