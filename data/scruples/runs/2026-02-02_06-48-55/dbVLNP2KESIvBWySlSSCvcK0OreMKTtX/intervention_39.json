She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the scenario is about prom dates and some conflict during dinner.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also needed to find a date for the daughter's friend. They asked their friend Luke, who was shorter. Then, during dinner, the dates (the daughter and her friend) were being really rude to Luke, making fun of his height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school and leave them there. Now the author is wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points are: the girls were rude to Luke, and the author and Luke took action by ditching them. The author is now feeling guilty and asking for judgment.\n\nOn one hand, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's height and using a racial slur is unacceptable. The author felt responsible for Luke and tried to stand up against the bullying, which could be seen as protecting their friend.\n\nBut on the other hand, ditching someone, even in response to their bad behavior, could be considered abandoning them. However, the girls were the ones who initiated the mistreatment. The author didn't have to go through with the plan, but they chose to do so because they stood by their friend's side. \n\nWas it wrong to abandon the girls after they treated Luke so poorly? The author might have had a right to protect their friend and put an end to the harassment. However, it's important to consider if there were other ways to handle it, like confronting the girls directly or finding a way to end the evening without leaving them stranded. But given the situation, the girls were being hostile, and the author might have felt that this was the only way to stop the mistreatment.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she acknowledged her daughter's behavior. So maybe the author wasn't entirely at fault here. They acted in defense of a friend who was being bullied. \n\nI think the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified given the girls' behavior. The girls were the ones who were in the wrong by being cruel. The author's decision to leave them might be a reaction to their own mistreatment. While ditching someone is never pleasant, the context is important. If the girls were being abusive, then the author might not be the one in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author have a responsibility to the girls since they were asked to take them? The cleaning lady set up this arrangement, but the girls' behavior was their own choice. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting Luke, even if it meant leaving the girls. \n\nIn the end, the girls were the ones who acted inappropriately, so the author's actions could be seen as a justified response. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole here.\n"
