She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe main character (OP) was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. As part of the arrangement, OP also had to find a date for the daughter's friend, who was very short. They set up their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. On the night of prom, things go south when Luke's date (the friend) is rude to him, making fun of his height, and even calling out the restaurant's Chinese food in a derogatory way. OP's date also joins in. After enduring an hour and a half of this, OP decides to ditch the girls, taking them to the school parking lot and telling them they won't be going to the dance because of their behavior. The girls were upset, and later the cleaning lady apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether OP is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\nFirst, OP was set up in a situation where the dates chosen for them and their friend were problematic. The cleaning lady's daughter and her friend were hostile towards Luke, making fun of his height and using a racial slur against the Chinese restaurant. This behavior was unacceptable, and it's understandable that OP felt protective of their friend.\n\nSecond, OP decided to take action by abandoning the girls. While this might seem harsh, the alternative was to let Luke endure further humiliation, which OP didn't want. They did inform the girls beforehand and gave them a chance to change their behavior, which they didn't do. \n\nThird, the cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that she recognized her daughter's and her friend's poor behavior. So OP's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable conduct. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with how OP handled the situation. Instead of confronting the girls directly or trying to diffuse the situation, they chose to abandon them. While the girls were being rude, ditching them in the parking lot might have been a bit extreme. But given the context, it's a reaction to being mistreated, and OP was standing up for their friend. \n\nIn terms of ethics, OP's actions were a form of self-defense and defense of their friend against bullying. The girls initiated the negative behavior, so OP isn't the one at fault here. The cleaning lady's role in setting up the dates with incomplete information (not disclosing the friend's short stature and the daughter's friend's behavior) also plays a part. \n\nSo putting it all together, OP wasn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their friend from being tormented and stood up against the girls' disrespectful behavior. The answer is B.\n"
