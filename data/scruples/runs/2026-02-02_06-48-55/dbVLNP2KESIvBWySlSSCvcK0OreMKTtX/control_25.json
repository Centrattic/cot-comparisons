She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for ditching his prom date. So the story goes that the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, but there's a catch: the daughter's friend also needs a date. The author gets his friend Luke to go along, who's shorter and maybe not confident. Then during the dinner, Luke's date is being really rude, making fun of his height, and even calling the Chinese food \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke get fed up, decide to ditch the girls and leave them at the school.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the author made a mistake in setting up this date in the first place. He was asked by the cleaning lady, but maybe he should have said no if he felt uncomfortable. Also, did he have the right to take matters into his own hands by ditching them? On one hand, the girls were being disrespectful and cruel to Luke, which is not okay. The author stepped in to protect his friend, which seems noble. But setting up a date with people you barely know, especially when you know their friend is a \"POS,\" might have been a bad idea. Also, the fact that the author knew the friend was short and the other girl was even shorter, leading to potential teasing, maybe he should have anticipated some issues but went ahead anyway. \n\nBut then, when the situation escalated, he and Luke decided to leave. Was that the right call? It's a judgment call. They were in a bad situation, and leaving to avoid further humiliation for Luke makes sense. However, ditching someone at a school parking lot in the middle of prom is pretty harsh. The girls were probably embarrassed and angry, and the author might have overreacted. But he did try to warn the cleaning lady later, and she apologized. So maybe he's not the asshole because he stood up for his friend and addressed the bullying. On the flip side, he set up this situation without considering the consequences. But the main issue was the girls' behavior. It's a bit of a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he intervened to stop the bullying, even if the setup was flawed. So answer B.\n"
