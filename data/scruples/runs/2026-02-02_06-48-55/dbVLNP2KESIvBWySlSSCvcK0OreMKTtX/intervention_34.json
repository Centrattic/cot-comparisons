She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about ditching a prom date after some awkward events. So, the user set up their friend Luke to go with the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The problem starts when Luke's date is rude about his height and uses a racial slur at the restaurant. The author and Luke then decide to abandon the girls at the school parking lot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of everyone involved. The author's friend Luke is described as a nice guy, but his date was making fun of him, especially about his height. The cleaning lady's daughter's friend also joined in. Additionally, there's the racial slur about Chinese food, which is definitely offensive. The author felt embarrassed and upset because their friend was being mistreated.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to ditch the girls? Was their action justified? The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate, especially the racial slur. The author might have felt that standing up for Luke was the right thing. However, the method they chose\u2014abandoning the girls in a parking lot\u2014could be seen as drastic. \n\nBut wait, the author wasn't directly involved in the mistreatment; they were just a passenger. They tried to talk to Luke and came up with a plan together. The girls' actions were hostile, so maybe the author and Luke were just trying to stop the bullying. However, ditching someone, even if they were being rude, might not be the best solution. There could have been other ways to handle it, like confronting the girls directly or leaving the restaurant.\n\nAlso, considering the cleaning lady's role: she set up the date knowing the daughter's friend was short, but maybe she didn't foresee the other issues. The author might have felt responsible for Luke's well-being, so they acted to protect him. \n\nBut was ditching the girls the right choice? While the girls were being rude, the author's action of abandoning them could be seen as a breach of trust or responsibility, especially since they were dates. However, given the offensive comments and the humiliation Luke faced, the author's intervention might be justified as standing up against bullying. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The girls definitely acted inappropriately, but the author's response might have been too harsh. Still, the author might have felt they had no better option at the moment. The question is whether their action of ditching the girls was wrong. Considering the context, maybe not, because they were protecting a friend from further harm. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because ditching someone is generally not good, but the circumstances were extreme.\n"
