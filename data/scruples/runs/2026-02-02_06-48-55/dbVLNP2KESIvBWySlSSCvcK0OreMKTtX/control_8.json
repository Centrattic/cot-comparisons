She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author setting up a prom date for a cleaning lady's daughter and her friend by arranging dates with his friend Luke. On prom night, Luke's date is rude, mocking Luke's height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, leading to the girls' anger.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He was asked by the cleaning lady to help the two girls by finding dates. He did so with good intentions, bringing in his friend Luke, who's a good kid. The problem arises when the dates (the girls) behave poorly. The author steps in to protect his friend from bullying. He and Luke decide to leave the girls at the school, effectively ditching them. The key here is whether this action was justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe girls' behavior was definitely inconsiderate and hurtful. They mocked Luke's height and made a racially insensitive comment about the restaurant. The author, seeing his friend being treated badly, took action. While ditching someone is generally rude, the context here is different. The girls were the ones who instigated the bad behavior. The author's decision to protect his friend and walk away from the toxic situation could be seen as self-defense for Luke's emotional well-being.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the author's method. Instead of confronting the girls directly or finding another solution, they chose to abandon them. This could have been handled more gracefully, perhaps by calling a parent or having the girls return home. But given that it's prom and the girls were already acting out, maybe the author felt that was the only option left.\n\nThe cleaning lady apologized later, which suggests she acknowledged her daughter's misconduct. The author's intentions were good, and the girls were the ones at fault. So, in this scenario, the author isn't the asshole. He stood up for his friend and took a stand against bullying, even if the method was abrupt. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
