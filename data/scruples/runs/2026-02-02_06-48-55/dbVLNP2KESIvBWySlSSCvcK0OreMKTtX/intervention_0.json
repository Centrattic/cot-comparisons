She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person set up a prom date for their friend Luke with the daughter of their mother's cleaning lady. The cleaning lady's daughter's friend is also involved. On prom night, the girls are being really rude to Luke\u2014mocking his height and even making a racist comment about the restaurant. The author and Luke decide to ditch the girls and leave them at the school. The author feels guilty now and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The girls were clearly being mean and disrespectful. The author did what they thought was right to protect their friend. But was ditching them the right move?\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as standing up against bullying, which is positive. However, leaving someone stranded, even if they behaved badly, could be considered inconsiderate or even cruel. The girls might have been in an embarrassing situation, and the author took away their prom experience. Is that justified?\n\nAnother angle: the author was acting on behalf of Luke, who was being mistreated. The decision was mutual between the author and Luke. But by taking that action, they might have escalated the situation. Did they have the right to make that decision for the girls? Maybe not, but the girls' behavior was inexcusable.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady apologized later, which suggests she acknowledged the girls' behavior. The author might have learned a lesson, but the question is about whether they were wrong in the moment.\n\nI think the key points are the girls' initial disrespect and the author's reaction. While the girls were in the wrong, the author's actions could be seen as taking it too far. However, protecting a friend from bullying might be justified. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often debate intent. The author's intent was to stop the bullying, which is good, but the method was harsh. However, given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The answer might depend on whether the harshness of the response outweighs the initial wrongdoing. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being the asshole because they stood up against the girls' bad behavior to protect their friend. The girls were in the wrong first. But some might argue that ditching them was uncalled for. Still, considering the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
