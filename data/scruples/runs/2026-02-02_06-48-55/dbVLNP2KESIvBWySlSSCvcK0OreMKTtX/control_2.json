She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for ditching their prom date. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to be a prom date for the cleaning lady's daughter. The catch was that the daughter's friend, who's really short, also needed a date. The author asked their friend Luke, who is shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend.\n\nOn prom night, they pick up the girls, go to a Chinese restaurant where the friend's date is rude about Luke's height, and insults the food. The author's date also joins in. They take the girls to the dance, then kick them out of the car because of their behavior. The author feels bad about it but is still wondering if they were wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe cleaning lady set up this arrangement, knowing the daughter's friend was short. She probably didn't anticipate the friend's date being rude. The author's friend Luke is being harassed by the girls. The author steps in to protect Luke, who is a friend, and decides to leave the girls at the school. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to help Luke and stop the bullying. However, ditching the girls might have been harsh. The cleaning lady later apologized, which might indicate that the girls' behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author was supposed to be the date for the cleaning lady's daughter, and by ditching both the daughter and her friend, the author is not just fulfilling their own obligation. The daughter was part of the group that was being rude. But the author was also a date for the daughter. So, by ditching them, did they violate the terms of their own date? \n\nAlso, the author might have a point in protecting Luke, especially since Luke was being targeted. But the act of ditching the girls could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. However, considering the girls' behavior was abusive and Luke was being humiliated, maybe the author's actions were justified.\n\nAnother angle: The author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) was complicit in the bullying. So, by standing up to her, the author might have been defending Luke. But then, the author did ditch their own date, which is a big deal. Prom dates are supposed to be a mutual commitment. However, in this case, the author's main issue was with the friend's date, not necessarily their own date. But the friend was part of the group that was being abusive.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests that the daughter's actions were not acceptable. So maybe the author was in the right to intervene. Also, considering Luke was being targeted and it was a group effort to mock him, the author stepping in to protect a friend could be seen as justifiable. \n\nBut then again, the author was the one who set up the dates. Maybe they should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls before things escalated. However, given the situation, they chose to act when the girls were being particularly cruel. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions were in response to the girls' bullying behavior towards their friend. They took a stand, which might be seen as the right thing to do. The cleaning lady later apologized, which supports the author's perspective. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole here. \n\nBut there's a nuance. Ditching someone's date could be a breach of trust, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The key factors are the girls' behavior and the author's intent to protect a friend. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
