She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who set up a prom date for his friend and another girl through his mom's cleaning lady. The problem starts when the dates, especially the friend, are being really rude to his friend Luke because he's short. The guy feels bad for Luke, and then they decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot instead of taking them to the prom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also help her daughter's friend by finding a date. He chose his friend Luke, who's also short. The girls then mocked Luke during dinner, using derogatory comments about his height and even called the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a racist slur. The guy felt that their behavior was unacceptable and decided to leave Luke out of it by taking them to the school and kicking them out. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The key points here are the girls' behavior and the guy's response. The girls were being mean to Luke, which is clearly wrong. The guy and Luke decided to take a stand against that behavior. However, the way they did it was to abandon the girls, which could be seen as a harsh but justified reaction given the girls' actions. \n\nBut there are some considerations. The guy was acting as a date, so he had a responsibility to his friends and the girls. By ditching them, he might have broken a social contract. However, the girls were being abusive and unkind, which might have given him a reason to walk away. Also, the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend had a history of problematic behavior, as mentioned by the cleaning lady.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have tried to mediate the situation or talked to the girls first to stop the bullying. Instead, he decided to leave them, which might have been a form of retaliation. Depending on one's perspective, this could be seen as standing up for a friend or as a betrayal of his obligations. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the girls were indeed being cruel, then supporting Luke and protecting him from bullying is on the right side. The guy's action was to stop the harassment, even if it meant ditching the girls. However, the method of doing it\u2014kicking them out of the car\u2014might have been abrupt and could have been handled differently, but the intent was to prevent Luke from being humiliated further.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy's actions were a response to the girls' mistreatment of his friend. The girls were the ones in the wrong for their bullying and racist remarks. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for his friend and refusing to let the girls continue their abuse. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
