She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date at the door after some bad behavior from the dates and their friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the story. The author arranged to take a girl to prom as a favor to the cleaning lady, and also found a date for the friend. The dates were supposed to be mutual friends. The problem started when the friend of the author's date was rude to Luke, the author's friend who was acting as the date. The friend made derogatory comments about his height and called the Chinese restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls to avoid further humiliation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author set up the dates, the dates acted disrespectfully, and the author decided to end the night abruptly. The author's reasoning is that the girls were unkind, and they wanted to protect Luke from being hurt.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the girls clearly behaved badly. They insulted Luke's height and used a racial slur. That's pretty unacceptable. The author and Luke had every right to feel uncomfortable and decide not to continue the evening with them. However, the author did agree to take them to the prom, so there's a question about whether they should have handled it differently. Maybe they could have left the restaurant without dishing them out, but the situation was escalating. The girls were being cruel and the author wanted to stop it.\n\nBut ditching them in the parking lot might be seen as harsh. However, given the girls' behavior, maybe the author was justified. The cleaning lady also apologized later, indicating that the behavior was not justified.\n\nIn AITA terms, the author is often the asshole if they act without considering the other person's side, but in this case, the girls were at fault. The author's actions were a reaction to their unkindness. So, the author might not be the asshole here. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
