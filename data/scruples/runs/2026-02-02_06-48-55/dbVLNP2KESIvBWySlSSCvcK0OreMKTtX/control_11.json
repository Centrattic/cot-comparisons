She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ditching a prom date and a friend's date after they were rude.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and he arranged for his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The friend is short, and Luke is also short but a good guy. On prom night, they go to a Chinese restaurant where the dates are making fun of Luke for his height, even using racist language (\"Chink food\"). The author and Luke decide to leave the girls at the school parking lot, cutting them off from the dance.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The girls were clearly rude and inconsiderate, especially with the racist comment. The author and Luke stood up for Luke by ending the date, which could be seen as standing against bullying. However, ditching someone, even in self-defense against cruelty, can have consequences. The girls were left stranded, which might be seen as harsh, but the behavior they exhibited was unacceptable.\n\nThe author did warn the cleaning lady later, and she apologized. The author's intention was to stop the mistreatment of his friend. From a moral standpoint, defending someone being bullied is justifiable. However, whether ditching them was the right action is debatable. But given the context of the girls' behavior and the fact that the author was protecting his friend, it's more about self-defense and standing up against harassment.\n\nThe answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the action was a response to bullying and offensive behavior, even if the method was extreme. The author's intent was to protect his friend and stop the abuse, which aligns with doing the right thing despite the harsh outcome.\n"
