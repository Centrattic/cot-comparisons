She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves the author being set up by their mom's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, along with a friend. The friend, Luke, is supposed to take the daughter's friend. The problem starts when Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The author then decides they've had enough and they ditch the girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cleaning lady asked the author to help her daughter, who needed a date after breaking up with a problematic boyfriend. The author arranged for Luke to take the friend. The girls' behavior during dinner was inappropriate\u2014mocking Luke's height and the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to cut the outing short. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior. They didn't abandon them without reason. They had a valid reason to leave, especially since the dates were being disrespectful. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. \n\nBut was ditching them the right move? Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like confronting the girls directly or ending the date politely. However, the author did try to make a plan to end the evening, which suggests they were looking for a solution. The girls were inconsiderate, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nAlso, considering the setup: the cleaning lady approached the author for help, and the author was in a position where they had to manage two dates. The friend Luke was being mistreated, so the author's decision might be seen as protecting their friend. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: They went along with the plan without knowing the girls better, maybe they should have intervened earlier. But the main issue was the girls' behavior. The author had the right to walk away from a hostile situation. \n\nThe cleaning lady's later apology indicates she saw the girls' fault. The author's actions were a response to being mistreated. So, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
