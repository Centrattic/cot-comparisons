She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date after the date's friend was rude to their friend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also to find another date for the daughter's friend. The author did that by involving a friend, Luke, who was shorter. The problem started when Luke's date made fun of him, including a racist comment about the restaurant. The author, feeling bad for Luke, decided to ditch both girls and leave them at the school.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author was justified in ditching the prom dates. On one hand, the author had a valid reason: the dates were being mean to Luke, which is unacceptable behavior. The racist remark is a red flag, and the author stood up for their friend. That shows empathy and standing against bullying or disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone on prom night is a significant disappointment. The author had an obligation to the dates, especially since the cleaning lady's daughter was the original prom date. The author might have shouldered responsibility for the situation, maybe by addressing the behavior earlier or finding another way to handle it without abandoning the dates. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014how the girls were acting, the racist comment, and the emotional impact on Luke\u2014it's understandable why the author decided to leave. The author took responsibility for their friend and didn't let the girls' behavior go unchecked. The cleaning lady even apologized later, acknowledging the girls' trashy behavior.\n\nHowever, ditching someone can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or not going along with the plan. But given the circumstances, especially the racist comment and the bullying, the author's actions could be viewed as a necessary stand against harmful behavior, even if it caused embarrassment for the dates. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's intention was to stop the mistreatment of their friend. The action was a reaction to unacceptable behavior. While ditching is usually frowned upon, the reasons here might justify it. The answer might hinge on whether the ends justify the means. If the author had a valid reason and tried to address the issue, maybe they're not the asshole. But if they could have handled it without ditching, perhaps they are. However, in that moment, the immediate action was to protect their friend, which is commendable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
