She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves a setup where the author's mother's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom, and also find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author approached their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family. They arranged for Luke to take the friend. \n\nOn prom night, the restaurant incident happened. The friend (the 4'9\" girl) and her friend (the cleaning lady's daughter) were making fun of Luke's height and the restaurant's food. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls by taking them to the school and kicking them out. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior. The author is now wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author set up this arrangement with good intentions\u2014helping the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. However, the girls were disrespectful towards Luke. The author took action to protect Luke's feelings. But was ditching them the right move?\n\nPossible angles: Consent and boundaries. The author and Luke were in a position where they agreed to take the girls to prom. By leaving them at the school, they're breaking that agreement. However, the girls were being abusive, which could justify the author's actions as self-defense or protecting a friend.\n\nAlso, the author's responsibility. They may have known that the girls had a history of bad behavior (the daughter's ex was a \"POS\"), but still agreed to set up the dates. However, the insults during the dinner were inexcusable. The author's actions could be seen as a way to stop the harassment.\n\nAnother point: the girls were left stranded. The author and Luke didn't just leave them at the dance but actually kicked them out, which might have left them without transportation. But considering the behavior, it's possible the author felt it was a necessary consequence.\n\nThe cleaning lady apologized, which suggests she agreed that the girls were in the wrong. So, there's some validation from another adult that the author's actions were justified.\n\nHowever, taking matters into one's own hands by ditching someone, even if they were being mean, could be seen as harsh. The author might have considered other options, like confronting the girls directly or not going to the dance. But given the situation escalating during dinner, maybe the immediate action was the only recourse.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they set up this scenario and might have underestimated the girls' behavior. They could argue they were protecting Luke, who was being humiliated. The author's intention was to do good, but the outcome was that the girls were left in a bad situation. However, given the context, maybe the author isn't the asshole because they acted to stop bullying.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong), because their actions were a response to protect their friend from harassment, even if the method was extreme. The cleaning lady's apology also supports that the girls were at fault. The author's intention and the circumstances justify their actions.\n"
