She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend also needed a date. The author then asked their friend Luke, who is shorter (5'3\") and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. Both girls are supposed to go to prom with the author and Luke.\n\nOn prom night, they go to a Chinese restaurant. The author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) and her friend (Luke's date) are both mean to Luke. The friend even calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is clearly offensive. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls after an hour and a half. They take them to the school parking lot and kick them out, leading to the girls being upset and the author still feeling guilty about it now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning was that the girls were being intolerable to Luke, so they decided to stop it. But was this the right call?\n\nLet me think. The author was acting as a matchmaker here. They set up Luke with the short girl, knowing she was a friend of the cleaning lady's daughter. The problem arose when the dates were rude to Luke. The author felt responsible and tried to protect their friend. However, their solution was to abandon the girls, which is a form of public humiliation and could be seen as a violation of social trust. The cleaning lady had asked the author to take her daughter, so the author had a commitment there. By ditching the girls, the author broke that promise and possibly caused embarrassment.\n\nBut on the other hand, the girls were being cruel, which is inexcusable. The author might have felt that the girls were creating a toxic environment and decided to take a stand. However, the appropriate response might have been to confront the girls directly, not to abandon them. The author could have addressed the behavior without leaving, perhaps by talking to the girls or ending the date politely. By taking a more confrontational approach and using Luke's car to kick them out, the author escalated the situation and left the girls in a public place, which is disrespectful.\n\nAnother angle is that the author was trying to help their friend, Luke, who was being harassed. The author might have stepped in to protect Luke, which is commendable. But the method used was extreme. The author might have thought that leaving was the only way to stop the bullying. However, there are more appropriate ways to handle such a situation, like calling an adult or ending the date respectfully without humiliation.\n\nAlso, considering the cleaning lady's role, she knew her daughter could be \"trashy\" and still asked the author to take her. The author might have taken on more responsibility than they should have. But the author's actions went beyond just handling the situation\u2014they made the girls feel embarrassed and left them stranded, which is not a good solution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girls' behavior was unacceptable, the author's response of ditching them might not have been the right approach. The author should have addressed the behavior without abandoning the girls. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
