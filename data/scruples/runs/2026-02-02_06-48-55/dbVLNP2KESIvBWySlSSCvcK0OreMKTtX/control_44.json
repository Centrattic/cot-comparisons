She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about ditching a prom date. The person wrote a detailed story where they set up a prom date for a friend's daughter through a cleaning lady. The setup involved another friend, Luke, who ended up being treated badly by the girls, leading the author and Luke to ditch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author arranged for Luke to date the friend's daughter's friend, who was short and turned out to be rude. The girls were mean to Luke, making fun of his height and even calling out the restaurant's food. The author felt responsible because they set this up. When confronted, they decided to ditch the girls, which caused the girls to be upset and angry.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a responsibility to ensure the date went smoothly? By setting up the date, they might have a duty of care. However, the girls' behavior was inappropriate, and Luke was being mistreated. The author intervened to stop the bullying, which could be seen as protecting Luke. But was ditching the girls the right approach?\n\nDitching someone, even if they're being rude, is generally considered poor etiquette. However, in this case, the girls were actively harassing Luke. The author might have felt justified in standing up for their friend. However, the act of leaving the girls stranded could be seen as a harsh response. The cleaning lady had apologized, so maybe the author wasn't entirely at fault, but they did abandon the girls, even if it was to protect Luke.\n\nAnother angle: the author set up the date with knowledge of the girls' potential behavior. The cleaning lady mentioned the daughter's ex was a \"POS,\" so maybe there were signs of the daughter being difficult. Did the author overstep by orchestrating the setup? By allowing Luke to be put in that situation, the author might bear some responsibility for not foreseeing the negative outcome.\n\nBut then, when the situation escalated, the author took action to stop the harassment. The question is whether their response was proportionate. Ditching them was extreme, but it could be seen as a necessary action to protect Luke. Alternatively, they could have left the restaurant calmly or handled it another way without abandoning the girls.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, it's a balance between their intent to help a friend and the consequences. They might not be entirely wrong because they intervened against bullying, but ditching the date without a plan (leaving them stranded) is a problem. However, the cleaning lady did apologize, implying she understood her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo the answer might depend on whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. The key is that the girls were being jerks, and the author stood up for their friend, but ditching them was a harsh reaction. However, in the context of the girls' behavior, maybe it's understandable. The dilemma here is between protecting a friend and respecting obligations. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they acted against bullying, even if the method was abrupt.\n"
