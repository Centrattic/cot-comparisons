She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. \n\nFirst, the setup: The narrator's mother's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, with the added condition that he also find a date for the daughter's friend. The friend is very short. The narrator arranges for his friend Luke, who is also short, to be the date for the friend. \n\nNow, the key events on prom night. They pick up the girls, go to a Chinese restaurant. Luke's date immediately insults the food by calling it \"Chink food,\" which is a slur. The narrator's date joins in with the teasing about Luke's height. The narrator feels bad for Luke, who is being harassed. After some time, they decide to confront the girls, take them to the school, and kick them out of the car, refusing to take them to the dance anymore. \n\nThe narrator is now wondering if he was wrong to do that. \n\nSo, the main points to consider: The girls were being cruel and using slurs, which is unacceptable. The narrator stood up for his friend, which is a positive action. However, the method they used was to abandon the girls mid-prom, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the question is about whether the narrator is in the wrong. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate. The narrator tried to protect his friend, which is commendable. While ditching them might be a strong move, it was a response to their misconduct. The cleaning lady even apologized later. \n\nI think the narrator isn't in the wrong because he was defending his friend from bullying and offensive behavior. The girls earned the negative response by their actions. So the answer is B (No).\n"
