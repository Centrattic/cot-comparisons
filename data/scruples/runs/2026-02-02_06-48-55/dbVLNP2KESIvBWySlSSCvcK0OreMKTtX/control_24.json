She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The story involves setting up two dates for friends, but things go south when Luke's date is rude to him.\n\nFirst, the author set up Luke as a date for the friend who was short. The problem arises when the girls, including Luke's date and the author's date, are disrespectful. The key points are the girls' behavior: Luke's date calls the restaurant \"Chink food\" and mocks Luke's height. The author and Luke decide to ditch them because they can't handle the cruelty.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to help by setting up dates, but they had to deal with the girls' awful behavior. The decision to leave was based on protecting Luke from being bullied. However, ditching someone, even in response to their bad behavior, can be seen as a breach of social contract. The author had a responsibility to their dates, but they could argue self-defense of their friend's well-being.\n\nBut then again, the author did try to warn Luke beforehand about the cleaning lady's daughter's friend being short. Maybe they should have anticipated some issues but didn't. Also, the mother knew her daughter could be trashy but still asked the author to set this up. So the mother might share some blame.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to protect Luke and stop the harassment. However, walking out on someone, even if justified, might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, it's more about self-preservation and standing up against bullying. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
