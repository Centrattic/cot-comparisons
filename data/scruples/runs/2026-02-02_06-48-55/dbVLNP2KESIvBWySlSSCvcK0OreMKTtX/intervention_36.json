She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about ditching a prom date after a bad experience with the date and her friend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also to find a date for the daughter's friend. The friend is described as very short, and the author's friend Luke is shorter and had trouble with girls. The setup was supposed to be a match. But then, during the dinner, Luke's date made a racist comment about the Chinese restaurant, and both girls mocked Luke for his height. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the author took Luke's side, stood up against the girls' behavior, which included racism and bullying. They ended the date abruptly, which caused the girls to be angry. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to protect their friend from being humiliated and put a stop to inappropriate behavior. However, ditching someone at prom is a significant action. But given the circumstances, the girls' behavior was unacceptable, and the author might have felt justified. However, maybe they could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or not going along with the plan in the first place. But in the moment, their decision to leave was to prevent further harm to Luke.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was complicit in setting up a situation where Luke was put into a potentially uncomfortable position. The cleaning lady might have known her daughter's friend's behavior, but the author still went ahead. So maybe there's some responsibility there. However, the main issue is the response to the girls' actions. The author wasn't being cruel without cause; they were reacting to abuse.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They acted to stop bullying and racism, which is positive. But ditching someone is a harsh action. However, given the context, maybe not. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards not. Answer B.\n"
