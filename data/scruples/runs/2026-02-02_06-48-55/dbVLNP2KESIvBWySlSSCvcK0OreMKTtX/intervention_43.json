She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about ditching a prom date. The user set up their friend Luke to go with the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The cleaning lady's daughter was with a problematic boyfriend, and the user was asked to be the date. But the problem comes when Luke's date is being a jerk about his height and the food, leading to the decision to ditch them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also to find a date for her daughter's friend. The user involved their friend Luke, who was a nice guy but shorter. Then, during the dinner, Luke's date was making fun of him for his height, and even made a derogatory comment about the Chinese restaurant. The user's date also joined in. The user felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls after an hour and a half.\n\nKey points here: The user was part of setting up the dates. They had a responsibility to the girls, especially since they were friends with the cleaning lady and had agreed to take them. However, the girls were being abusive towards Luke, which is not okay. The user's response was to abandon the girls, which could be seen as a form of revenge or standing up for their friend. \n\nBut is the user at fault? Well, ditching someone at a school event is a serious action. Even if the girls were acting badly, the user could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls directly or not going along with them to the dance. By using Luke's car and then leaving them, the user might be responsible for putting the girls in a difficult situation. Also, the cleaning lady's daughter might have been embarrassed or faced consequences from the school or her mother.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls' behavior was inexcusable. Mocking someone for their height and using a racially insensitive term is unacceptable. The user's intention was to protect their friend, which is commendable. But the action of ditching them might have been the wrong approach. Maybe they should have talked to the girls first, or involved an adult, or not agreed to the setup in the first place if they thought there might be issues.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the user might be in the wrong for abandoning the girls despite their behavior, but the girls were also inconsiderate. However, the user's responsibility to their dates is a factor. The question is whether the user was wrong for ditching them. The answer depends on whether the user had a duty to them that they breached, even if the girls were acting badly. If the user agreed to take them to prom, they had a responsibility to see it through unless there were extreme circumstances. Ditching them might be seen as a breach of that responsibility, making the user the asshole. Alternatively, standing up for their friend could be seen as justified. But the act of leaving them in the parking lot is a harsh reaction. \n\nI think the user is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation appropriately. They could have addressed the girls' behavior on the spot instead of abandoning them. The answer is A.\n"
