She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after ditching their prom date. The situation involves a setup where the author arranged dates for two girls via their mother's cleaning lady. The main issue arises when Luke's date is rude and disrespectful, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls after they behave badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. They set up the dates with the knowledge that one of the girls was a friend of the cleaning lady's daughter, and that the friend was very short. The author's friend Luke was also shorter, so there was a potential for height-based teasing. The girls did indeed tease Luke, which led to the author and Luke deciding to leave them at the school. \n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? The key points here are consent and the handling of the situation. The author didn't force Luke into the situation, but they did set it up. The girls' behavior was clearly inconsiderate and offensive, especially with the derogatory remarks about Chinese food. The author's decision to leave them at the school was a reaction to this behavior. \n\nHowever, ditching someone can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the other party was being rude. The author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) was part of this setup as well. The author might have a valid reason to feel wronged because they stepped in to protect Luke from being hurt. But on the other hand, they did leave the girls stranded, which could be seen as a harsh reaction. \n\nThe cleaning lady did apologize later, which suggests that the behavior of the girls was not expected. The author's intention was to protect their friend and stand up against disrespect. In that context, their actions might be justified as a self-defense measure to prevent further humiliation of Luke. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable behavior. While ditching someone isn't typically considered good, the circumstances here were extreme. The author wasn't just ditching for no reason but reacting to harassment. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
