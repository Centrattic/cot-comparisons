She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is the asshole for ditching their prom date. The story involves the author setting up a prom date for a friend, Luke, with two girls. The girls turn out to be rude, making fun of Luke's height and the restaurant's food. The author and Luke then decide to ditch them and take them back to school instead.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, with the caveat of also finding a date for the daughter's friend. The author chose Luke, who is shorter and from a wealthy family. The problem arises when the dates act disrespectfully towards Luke. The author felt it was necessary to stand up for their friend and end the night early.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, they didn't do anything illegal. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. The author tried to help a friend and took responsibility when things went wrong. They intervened when they saw the dates being cruel, which shows they cared about Luke's feelings. However, ditching someone at school is a breach of social etiquette. The girls were left in a bad situation, though they had been rude first. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she acknowledged the girls' behavior.\n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to protect their friend from further humiliation. The action was a response to ongoing disrespect. While leaving abruptly might be seen as harsh, the alternative was allowing the girls to continue their behavior. The author's actions could be justified as standing up for someone being bullied, even if it's not the most diplomatic approach.\n\nBut, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls directly or ending the date gracefully instead of abandoning them. However, given the circumstances, the author's priority was Luke's well-being. The cleaning lady later apologized, showing understanding. So, considering all factors, the author's actions were a reaction to unacceptable behavior, and while the method was extreme, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
