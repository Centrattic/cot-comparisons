She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author setting up a prom date for a friend, Luke, with a girl who's 4'9\", and their friend. The girls end up being rude to Luke, leading him to ditch them.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, as requested. Then he found a date for her friend, Luke's date. The setup was supposed to make things work for everyone. The problem arises when the girls at dinner are being mean to Luke. The author steps in, suggests leaving them at the school. They do that, and the girls are upset.\n\nNow, considering the details. The girls were making fun of Luke's height and one called the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a racial slur. The author felt it was intolerable and decided to leave. Legitimately, if someone is being harassed or treated disrespectfully, stepping in is a reasonable response. But the author orchestrated the entire setup. Did he overstep by taking matters into his own hands? \n\nOn one hand, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate. The use of a slur and mocking someone's height is unacceptable. The author's decision to remove Luke from the situation could be seen as protecting him, which is a valid reason. On the other hand, he did set this whole thing up without perhaps considering that the girls might act that way. But he didn't know they would be so rude. He tried to help Luke by getting him a date, which was a kind gesture.\n\nThe cleaning lady apologized later, so maybe she was aware of her daughter's behavior. The author might have done the right thing by standing up against the harassment. However, ditching them publicly could have been a harsh response. But given the circumstances, it's understandable. The key here is the girls' behavior versus the author's reaction. The author wasn't the one being rude; he was trying to stop others from being rude. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
