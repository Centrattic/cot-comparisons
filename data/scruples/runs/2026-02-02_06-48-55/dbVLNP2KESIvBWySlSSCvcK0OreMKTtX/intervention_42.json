She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, so we need to analyze the situation from both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the setup: The cleaning lady asked the narrator to take her daughter to prom, and also wanted the narrator to find a date for the daughter's friend. The narrator arranged for their friend Luke to be the date. Then, during the dinner, Luke's date (the daughter's friend) is rude and makes fun of Luke's height, and the daughter joins in. The narrator and Luke decide to leave the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls are upset, and the cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of the narrator and their justification. The narrator felt that the girls' behavior was unacceptable and decided to take a stand by abandoning them. Was this an appropriate response?\n\nFrom one angle, the narrator was protecting their friend Luke from being humiliated and stood up against the girls' bullying. They took a firm stance against the disrespectful behavior. However, the issue is that the narrator and Luke left the girls in the middle of the night, knowing they wouldn't be able to attend prom. This could be seen as a harsh and possibly dangerous action. The girls might have been stranded, especially if they had no other way to get to the event. The narrator could have considered other solutions, like leaving the girls somewhere safe where they could still attend the dance, rather than abandoning them. Additionally, the narrator had a responsibility to the cleaning lady and the daughter, as they were acting as a date for both. The decision to ditch them might not have been the best approach, even if the girls were rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls clearly had a problem with Luke's height and made derogatory remarks. The narrator's friend was being treated poorly, and the narrator intervened. The decision to leave was a way to protect Luke's dignity. However, the method chosen was extreme. The narrator could have addressed the behavior immediately, maybe by confronting the girls or leaving the restaurant and finding another way to handle the situation without leaving them stranded.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she agreed that the daughter's behavior was bad. The narrator might feel justified, but the action of abandoning the girls without a ride to prom could be seen as going too far. There's a responsibility to ensure that others aren't left in a dangerous situation, especially minors. The narrator's actions might have been a form of punishment rather than a solution. While the girls were in the wrong, the narrator's response could be considered excessive and not the right approach to handling the situation. So, even if the girls deserved it, the method of response might make the narrator the asshole.\n"
