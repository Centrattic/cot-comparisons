She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date, but there's more context.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by his mother's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend, who was short, needed a date too. The author asked his friend Luke, who was shorter, to go as a date. So they planned this, and Luke borrowed a nice car from his rich parents. \n\nThen at the restaurant, Luke's date was being rude, making fun of his height. The author's date also joined in. The menu comment about \"Chink food\" was a big issue. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls. They took them to the school, told them they weren't going to the dance anymore, and kicked them out. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Was the author justified in ditching them? The girls were abusive and rude, but was ditching them the right way to handle it? The author had a responsibility as a date to protect Luke from that. However, ditching people, especially on prom night, can be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe the author had no choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was part of setting up the dates, so he might have known the friend's personality. Also, there's the issue of public humiliation. Even though the girls were mean, taking them to the school and leaving them could be seen as a public shaming. The author's actions might have been in defense of his friend, but was it the right approach?\n\nI think the key points are: the girls were abusive, the author tried to stop them, and then decided to leave. But ditching people is generally not ideal. However, considering the harassment Luke faced, maybe the author acted to protect his friend. So, is the author the asshole? It's a tough call. If you focus on the ditching, maybe yes. But the context of the girls' behavior complicates it. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because he stood up for his friend against bullying. But some might say A because ditching is disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
