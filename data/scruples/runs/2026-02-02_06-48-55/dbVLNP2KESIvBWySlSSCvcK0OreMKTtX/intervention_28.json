She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about ditching prom dates, so I need to break down the events step by step.\n\nThe author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, and also to find another date for the daughter's friend. The friend is described as very short. The author approached his friend Luke, who was shorter, to be the date for the friend. So, the setup was that the author's date (the cleaning lady's daughter) and Luke's date (the friend) went to prom together with the author and Luke.\n\nAt the restaurant, Luke's date was being really rude, making fun of Luke's height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date also joined in. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them, taking them to the school and leaving them there. The next day, the cleaning lady apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the author's actions: he set up this double date knowing the friend's height and Luke's height, which might have contributed to the situation. Then, when the dates were acting poorly, he decided to leave them. The question is whether the author is at fault for ditching them.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n1. **Consent and Agreement**: Did the author have the right to ditch the dates? The author was acting on behalf of Luke, but did they have mutual agreement? The story says they discussed it before the girls went to the bathroom. So, maybe both Luke and the author agreed to leave them.\n\n2. **Responsibility for the Setup**: The author arranged the dates, knowing the friend's shortness and Luke's height. Did he set up a situation where Luke would be targeted? That could be a problem. But was it his responsibility to prevent the girls from being rude? Maybe not entirely, since that's on the girls, but arranging someone who might be vulnerable in that situation might be a factor.\n\n3. **Ditching the Dates**: Ditching someone at a public place (school parking lot) might be seen as abandonment. However, the girls were acting inappropriately, so the author might feel justified in standing up for his friend. But is it acceptable to leave someone stranded? The author might have a point because of the girls' behavior, but the method of leaving was harsh.\n\n4. **Intentions and Consequences**: The author's intention was to stop the bullying. However, the consequence was leaving the girls stranded. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that the daughter's behavior was indeed problematic. But the author's action might have been the only way he saw to stop the harassment.\n\n5. **Moral Judgment**: Is it the author's responsibility to ensure the dates are respectful, or is the responsibility on the dates themselves? The author might have overstepped by arranging the dates without ensuring mutual compatibility, but once the dates were made, the responsibility for their behavior lies with them.\n\nAlso, the author might have been in a tough spot. He wanted to help his friend and prevent him from being humiliated, but the way he handled it might be seen as extreme. However, considering the girls' behavior, maybe it was a justified stand against bullying.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (Yes), then the reasoning would be that he arranged a situation that led to conflict and then ditched the girls without considering their safety. If B (No), then the reasoning would be that the girls' behavior was so unacceptable that he had a right to leave them, protecting his friend from harassment.\n\nI need to decide based on the details. The key points are that the author set up the dates knowing the friend's height and Luke's height, leading to the friend being made fun of. Then, the dates were rude and offensive. The author and Luke decided to leave them. The cleaning lady apologized later. \n\nThe author might be partially at fault for setting up a potentially problematic date, but the girls' behavior was the direct cause of the ditching. However, ditching them might have been an overreaction, but given the harassment, it could be seen as a stand against being treated poorly. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. The main issue is whether ditching is acceptable in response to harassment. If the author had left them at the restaurant or called someone to help, maybe it's better, but leaving them stranded at a school parking lot is harsh. However, the author might have felt it was necessary to stop the bullying. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he arranged the dates knowing the potential for conflict and then left them in a public but possibly unsafe place. However, if the alternative is that the girls were being truly intolerant, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nBut the act of ditching someone, even if they were rude, is generally considered a breach of trust and responsibility. The author might have been justified in ending the date but leaving them stranded was wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
