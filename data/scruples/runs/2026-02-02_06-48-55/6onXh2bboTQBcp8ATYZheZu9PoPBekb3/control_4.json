It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought her dream house and is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. The sister felt hurt and called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: a large number of kids, past experiences with hosting being chaotic, safety concerns with the pool, and the house not being childproof. These are legitimate concerns, especially regarding liability. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids is a big responsibility, and the author might be protecting their own space and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is being selfish because they didn't allow the party at her house. The sister had hosted Christmas every year, so maybe she expected the author to reciprocate by hosting the birthday. But the author's reasons seem more about practicality and safety rather than just selfishness. Also, the author mentions that they usually go to the sister's house, not the other way around, so maybe there's a pattern here where the author isn't in the habit of hosting large family events.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole might be over the top. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own home and safety. The sister's not considering the author's perspective and the risks involved could be the issue here. The author also contributed to the Christmas events in the past, so it's a mutual effort, but maybe the sister felt it's an imbalance now.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own well-being and the safety of their property. The sister should respect the author's decision even if she's disappointed. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
