It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a kid's birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to use the big backyard, grill, and pool for the party, but the author said no. The sister is upset and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's concerns are about liability, especially with the pool, and that their house isn't child-proof. They also mention their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister argues that the author has hosted other events at her place, like Christmas, so why not this? But the author mentions those events are more about convenience for the sister because of the large number of kids.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid. Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids, including those who aren't well-behaved, in a house not set up for that, and with a pool which is a safety risk, is a lot to handle. The sister's kids have never been there, so maybe the author isn't used to their behavior. Also, the sister's past events were at her house, which makes sense given the logistics. The author contributing desserts in the past doesn't mean they should host a party that's a potential liability for them.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling the author selfish might be harsh, but the author's decision is based on legitimate concerns. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't obligated to host. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
