It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author has a dream house and a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party with 50 people at the author's house. The author refused, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. Now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's house isn't child-proof, there's a pool which is a liability, and they're worried about safety. The sister has hosted big events at her own house before, like Christmas, and the author has contributed to those with desserts and help. But this time, it's a different scenario because the author's home might not be suitable for such a large group of kids.\n\nThe sister's reasoning is that the author has never hosted before, and they usually meet at her place because it's more convenient with her 14 kids. The author doesn't mind traveling to her sister's house but doesn't want the chaos at their own home. The sister feels it's unfair, especially since the author has hosted dessert in the past.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they have legitimate concerns about safety with 14 kids and 50 guests. The pool being a liability is a real issue. Plus, the house isn't child-proof, so accidents could happen. The author isn't refusing to help altogether but is setting boundaries for their own home's safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel slighted because the author has hosted other events, like Christmas, but this is a birthday party. The sister could feel that the author is being inconsistent or not being supportive. However, the difference is that the Christmas events are at the sister's home, which is already set up for big families. Hosting at the author's home with their own infrastructure (like a pool) adds different risks.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's right to set boundaries for their home, the safety concerns, and the sister's reaction. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014previous contributions like desserts show they are supportive. The sister's claim that the author is selfish might be an overreaction, especially since the author has valid safety concerns.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually respect others' boundaries about their homes. If someone is uncomfortable with the amount of kids or the potential risks, it's reasonable to say no. The sister might not have considered the specific reasons behind the refusal, just seeing it as a personal slight. The author isn't in the wrong because they are protecting their home and safety, which is a valid reason.\n"
