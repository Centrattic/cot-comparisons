It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The writer bought a dream house and didn't want the sister to use it because of the potential chaos, safety issues with the pool, and maybe not wanting their kids to mix. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was asked to host a party with 50 people at the writer's house. The writer declined, leading to a fallout. The sister is upset, calling the writer selfish. The writer's reasons include the number of kids, the pool being a liability, and their house not being child-proof. They also mention that they usually meet at the sister's house because it's easier for her to manage the kids.\n\nThe sister argues that the writer has hosted Christmas events before, but the writer points out that they contribute differently by buying desserts and their parents help with cooking. The writer also mentions that the sister's kids haven't even been to their house before, so maybe there's a history of avoiding that.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the writer is setting boundaries for their own home. They have valid concerns about safety and their own comfort. Hosting a big party with 14 kids and 50 guests would be a lot. The sister might feel slighted, but the writer isn't obligated to allow that. The writer isn't the one who hosts the Christmas events; the sister does. So it's not a fair comparison. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially calling the writer an asshole. The writer has the right to decide who can use their property. The sister's kids not being well-behaved and the pool being a danger are legitimate concerns. The writer isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own home's safety and their own peace of mind. The sister might feel uncooperative, but the writer isn't obligated to let them host. The answer is probably B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
