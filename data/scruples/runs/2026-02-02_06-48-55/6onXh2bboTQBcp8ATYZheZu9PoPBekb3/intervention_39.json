It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids and the author's house is 5 hours away. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author said no, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reasons are liability (pool safety, kids not well-behaved), logistics (distance, chaos with 14 kids), and past contributions (bringing desserts, parents helping). The sister felt it was unfair, comparing it to hosting Christmas for years. The author's house isn't child-proof, and she's concerned about accidents. Also, the sister never visits her house because it's too far and too chaotic.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about personal space, safety, and practicality. She's not obligated to host, especially given the risks and the inconvenience. The sister's argument that she's hosted other events in the past might not be a strong counter because the circumstances are different (birthday party vs. Christmas gathering, different locations). The author has contributed in other ways, so it's not like she's not supporting the event at all.\n\nHowever, the sister might feel slighted because of past experiences where the author visited her place, but the author's house is far away and hosting there would be impractical. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but practical concerns. The sister's accusation of being selfish seems harsh, but maybe the author could have communicated her reasons better. Still, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own safety and comfort. The sister needs to respect the author's boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
