It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister saying no to hosting her sister's kid's birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the person who bought the house is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister wanted to use the big backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author says no because their house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three, and the kids have never been there before. They don't want any accidents on their property.\n\nThe sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months. The author claims they've been contributing to other events, like buying desserts and helping with cleaning, so they feel they've done their part.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are consent and safety. The author is within their rights to decline hosting. They own their home and can set boundaries. The sister's request was for a large event with many kids, which the author is uncomfortable with. The safety concerns about the pool are valid, especially if the kids aren't well-behaved. The sister's past hosting Christmas events doesn't mean the author is obligated to host this party. The author has a right to prioritize their safety and comfort in their own home.\n\nThe sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is based on legitimate concerns. The fact that they meet at the sister's house more often because of logistical reasons (her having 14 kids) supports the author's stance. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're making a practical decision. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
