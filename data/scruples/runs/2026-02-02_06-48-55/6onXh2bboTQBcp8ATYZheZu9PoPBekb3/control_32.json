It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids. The author mentions that traveling to their sister's place is a nightmare, but they usually go there. Now, the sister asked to host the party at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author declined, citing concerns about their own home's safety (not child-proof, pool liability) and their sister's kids being unruly except for the oldest three. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for saying no. They have valid concerns about their home's suitability for 14 kids, plus the pool's safety. They also mention that their sister's kids haven't even been to their house before, so there's no prior relationship or understanding of their living environment. The sister's argument about hosting Christmas for 10 years is different because that's their own home, which they can manage despite the chaos. The author has contributed to the Christmas events by bringing dessert and helping out, so they feel they've done their part in other ways.\n\nThe author's decision seems to be based on safety and practicality. They bought their dream house, which might be a significant investment, and they want to protect it. The liability of having 14 kids plus 50 guests in a non-child-proof environment with a pool is a real concern. The sister's reaction is harsh, calling them names, which might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't being inconsiderate by not hosting; they're making a choice that's important for their own home and safety. The sister's frustration might stem from feeling slighted, but the author's stance is justified given the circumstances. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
