It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The sister wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author refused and now they're not speaking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: the sister's kids are not well-behaved, the house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. Plus, the sister's house is the usual host for big events. The author also mentions that they usually go to the sister's place, so maybe the sister expected a favor here.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister felt hurt and called the author selfish. Maybe she felt the author was being unfair, especially since they've hosted Christmas for years. But the author points out that they contribute in other ways, like bringing dessert and helping with cleaning.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid safety concerns and the situation could be risky. They also own their home and have the right to set boundaries. The sister might have expected the author's home to be available, but the author's reasons are legitimate. The sister's reaction seems harsh. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
