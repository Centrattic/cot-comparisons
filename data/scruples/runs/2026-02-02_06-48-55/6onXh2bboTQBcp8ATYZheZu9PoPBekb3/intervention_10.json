It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has valid concerns about safety, especially with the pool. The sister felt slighted and called names, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They bought their dream house and don't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. Safety is a big factor here, especially with the pool. The author mentions that their house isn't child-proof and they don't want liability. That seems reasonable. Also, they usually visit the sister's house because it's easier for the sister to manage the kids. \n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been hosting big events for years, and the author is refusing now. But the author points out that those events were at the sister's house, which is more convenient because of the kids. The author also mentions contributing with desserts and helping with cleaning, so they're not entirely avoiding responsibility. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author selfish and an asshole. That's pretty strong, especially over a refusal based on valid safety concerns. The author's decision to prioritize their own home's safety and sanity isn't unreasonable. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the sister felt it was important to have the party at the author's house for some reason, but the author tried to explain their reasons. It's possible the sister didn't take those concerns seriously. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their property and safety. The sister's reaction might be more about feeling unappreciated than the actual refusal. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
