It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (an aunt) refuses to let her sister host a birthday party at her new house because of the 14 kids, the potential chaos, safety concerns with the pool, and the fact that the house isn't childproof. The sister is upset and called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister wants to host the party at her aunt's house, probably because it's more convenient for her, given the number of kids and the travel distance. The aunt, on the other hand, has a new home that's not set up for handling a large group of children, especially with a pool involved. She's also mentioned that they usually meet at the sister's house, and she doesn't mind traveling there. \n\nThe key points here are the practical aspects: the number of children, the lack of childproofing, and the pool liability. Having 14 kids plus 50 guests would be a massive crowd. The aunt's primary responsibility is to protect her own property and ensure safety. If her house isn't equipped to handle such a large and possibly unruly group, it's reasonable for her to decline. The sister might feel that the aunt is being unfair, especially if they have a history of hosting at her place. But the aunt's reasons seem valid. Also, the sister's argument about hosting Christmas in the past doesn't necessarily apply here because a birthday party might be a different scenario in terms of size and setup.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The sister might feel slighted, thinking the aunt should accommodate her, but the aunt has her own boundaries and valid concerns. The sister's reaction of calling her an asshole might be disproportionate if the aunt clearly communicated her reasons. The fact that the aunt has contributed to other events (like desserts) shows she does help, but it's a different kind of contribution. Hosting a party with 14 kids is a different level of responsibility, especially with a pool. The aunt is not obligated to allow her sister to use her property for an event that could be dangerous or overwhelming. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the aunt's decision seems to be based on genuine concerns about safety and practicality. The sister's anger might stem from feeling unappreciated or that the aunt isn't being supportive enough, but the aunt has the right to set boundaries for her own home. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
