It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the user bought a dream home they don't want to risk. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, the user's reasons: safety concerns (pool, not child-proof), previous experiences with the kids (except the oldest three), and a history of hosting at the sister's house with contributions. The sister argues they've hosted Christmas there before, but the user points out that's different in scale and context. The sister hosting is more convenient for her, but the user's home is a 5-hour drive away, so travel isn't easy. The user doesn't mind traveling to the sister's place for gatherings, which they do a few times a year.\n\nThe key factors here are safety, personal boundaries, and fairness. The user has legitimate safety concerns about the pool and the behavior of the kids. They've established a pattern where the sister hosts, and the user contributes financially (desserts) and with help from parents. The sister is upset about the birthday not being at the user's house, but the user's reasons are valid. The sister's past hosting without the user's home suggests she's used to convenience, but the user is within their rights to set boundaries. The comparison to Christmas is weak because 50 people for a birthday is different from an annual family event. The user isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
