It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a sister not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house because she has 14 kids and it's a big deal. The main points are the sister's reasoning: the kids are chaotic, the house isn't child-proof, pool safety concerns, and the fact that her sister's kids have never been to her house before. The sister who asked was called selfish and they haven't talked in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She owns her own home and has the right to control who uses it. Her concerns about safety and the potential for chaos are valid. A 3-year-old's party with 50 people would be overwhelming, especially with 14 kids from the other family. The pool being a liability is a real concern because pools can be dangerous if not supervised properly. The author might be trying to protect both her property and the safety of everyone involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister hosting the party might feel that the author isn't being supportive. The author mentions that they usually meet at the sister's house, so maybe the sister thought it was a fair swap. The author has contributed in other ways, like bringing desserts and helping with cleaning, which shows she's made an effort. However, hosting a big party at someone else's home is a different commitment. The author isn't obligated to host, especially if it's not convenient or safe.\n\nAnother angle is the distance. The houses are five hours apart, so maybe the sister didn't consider that traveling with 14 kids to the author's place is impractical. The author has been the one traveling to their house, which might mean the sister isn't considering the effort required for the author to have them over. But the author isn't required to host, so maybe she's justified in saying no.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling her selfish and the two months without contact might be overreacting. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. People have the right to say no to events that cause them stress or risk. The sister could have looked for another venue or adjusted the plans. The fact that the author has a valid reason (safety and chaos) supports her position. The comparison to Christmas is a bit different because hosting a family event annually is different from a one-time birthday party.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's protecting her home and safety. The sister should respect that decision even if she disagrees. So the answer is B (No).\n"
