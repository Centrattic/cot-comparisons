It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has a big house with a pool.\n\nFirst, the main points are: the sister wanted to host a birthday at the author's place, but the author refused. The reason given is the chaos of 14 kids, the pool's liability, and the house not being \"child-proof.\" The sister is upset because she claims the author is selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's reasons are about safety and practicality. A pool with many kids, especially from a family with 14 children, can be dangerous. The author mentions their house isn't child-proof, so liability is a concern. Plus, hosting a party for 50 people at their home might be overwhelming, especially with a large family that's usually chaotic. \n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been hosting family events for years at her place, and maybe she feels the author should reciprocate. But the author has a valid point about the convenience and safety. They live five hours away, so traveling there with 14 kids is a hassle. The author also mentions that they contribute with desserts and other help, so maybe the sister feels slighted not getting the author's house for the party.\n\nThe key factors here are safety (pool liability), the practicality of hosting such a large group, and mutual respect. The author isn't obligated to host, especially given the potential risks. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is based on sound reasoning. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister might be overreacting, but the author might have handled the refusal more gently.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid concerns and are not responsible for accommodating their sister's request if it's against their comfort or safety. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
