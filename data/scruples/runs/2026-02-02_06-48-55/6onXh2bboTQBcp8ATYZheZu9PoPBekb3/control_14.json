It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for refusing to let their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is already a lot to handle. The author bought their dream house with their husband, which they probably want to keep in good condition. The sister asked to host a birthday party for her nephew at the author's house, which would involve 50 people, using the backyard, grill, and pool. The author declined, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author's reasons for saying no include the chaos of 14 kids, the house not being child-proof, and the pool's liability. They also mention that their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister felt slighted and called the author selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to consider if the author's refusal is justified. The author's home is their private property. They have the right to set boundaries about who uses it and under what circumstances. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids could indeed be overwhelming, especially with the pool's safety concerns. The author isn't obligated to let family use their home if they're uncomfortable. The sister's past hosting doesn't negate the author's right to say no in this different scenario. Also, the author contributed to previous events by providing desserts and others helped with the work, so they weren't being stingy.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the sister felt it was a favor, especially since she hosts other events. But the author's reasons are valid and about their own safety and comfort. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their home's safety and their own peace of mind. So the answer should be B.\n"
