It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The author moved to their dream home and is worried about liability with the pool and the kids' behavior. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mention that their house isn't child-proof, there's a pool which is a safety risk, and the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author also points out that in the past, family gatherings happen at the sister's house because she has more space and it's easier for her to manage 14 kids. The sister is now asking for the author's house for a party with 50 people, which seems like a lot for the author to handle.\n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been hosting Christmas for 10+ years at her house, implying she's used to it. The author argues that comparing Christmas to a kid's birthday isn't fair. Also, the author mentions contributing to the food and helping with cleanup in the past, so they feel they're already giving enough.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has legitimate concerns about safety and the potential chaos of 50 people plus 14 kids in their home. Their house isn't child-proof, which could lead to accidents. The pool adds liability, which is a valid legal and safety concern. The author also doesn't want their sister's kids coming over because they prefer not to have them there, which is a personal boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that after years of hosting at her place, the author should reciprocate. The sister's argument could be that they usually meet at her house because it's easier for her with 14 kids, so this should be a time to switch. However, the author is setting a boundary for valid reasons, not just being selfish. The sister calling the author an asshole is harsh, but maybe the author could have handled the refusal more empathetically.\n\nBut the key points are the safety issues and the author's right to set boundaries for their home. The sister's kids aren't known to behave well, which increases the risk. The author isn't obligated to let others use their home for events, especially with potential dangers involved. The sister's reaction might be overblown given the author's concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have reasonable reasons for declining, and setting boundaries is important. The sister's response is extreme, but that doesn't make the author wrong for saying no. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
