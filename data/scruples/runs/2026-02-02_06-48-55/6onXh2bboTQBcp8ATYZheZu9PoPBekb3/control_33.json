It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house they're trying to protect. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party, but the author declined. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concerns are safety (pool liability, kids not well-behaved) and the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests in their house. The sister points to previous Christmas gatherings, but the author argues that's different because those are at the sister's house, which is more suited for large groups. The author has contributed to past events with food and help, so maybe the sister feels the author isn't pulling their weight. But the author is setting a boundary for their own home.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to set boundaries about their property. Safety concerns are valid, especially with a pool and many kids. The sister's request was for a large party at the author's house, which the author isn't comfortable with. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names and cutting off communication. The author's reasoning is about protecting their home and safety, which is reasonable. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to host. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
