It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is already a lot. The author bought their dream house and didn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests coming over. They turned down the request, and now there's a two-month silence because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons: their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want the risk of kids getting hurt. Plus, they mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. That's a valid concern. Also, the sister has hosted the Christmas gatherings for years, but the author thinks it's different because of the number of people and the environment.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that since the author has a bigger space (backyard, pool), it's a good venue. Maybe she felt it would be easier for the author to host, especially since the author travels to the sister's house often. The sister called the author selfish, which is a strong word. The author might feel that they've contributed enough by bringing desserts and helping with food each year.\n\nBut the key here is the author's right to their property. They can decide who is allowed on their property and under what conditions. The safety concerns are real\u201414 kids plus 50 guests in a backyard with a pool could be a disaster. The author isn't obligated to share their home for someone else's event, especially when it's not in their control. The sister might be using the Christmas gatherings as a precedent, but those are different because they're family events at her home, which is presumably more controlled. The author's place is a different setup.\n\nAlso, the sister hasn't been to the author's house with the kids before, which adds to the author's hesitation. The author's reasons are about safety and property liability, which are legitimate. The sister might be expecting the author to accommodate without considering the author's circumstances. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their own home's safety and their comfort. The sister's reaction seems over the top, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on safety and practicality. The sister might not see it that way, but the author's decision is reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
