It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They mentioned that their house isn't child-proof and they don't want kids drowning there. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reasons are safety concerns and the potential chaos. They also mention that they usually visit the sister's house because it's more convenient, given the distance. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author has refused, leading to a rift.\n\nI should think about whether the author's decision is reasonable. Having 14 kids plus 50 guests is a lot. The pool is a liability, especially if the kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author has a right to prioritize their home's safety and their own comfort. They also contribute to the family gatherings by bringing desserts and others help with cooking and cleaning. The sister's past actions of hosting Christmas for 10 years don't necessarily mean the author has to host now. The author's reasons seem valid\u2014maybe the sister should have considered the author's concerns instead of taking it as selfishness.\n\nBut maybe the sister felt entitled because they usually go to her place. However, the author's refusal is based on legitimate safety and logistical issues. The sister's reaction might be over-the-top. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
