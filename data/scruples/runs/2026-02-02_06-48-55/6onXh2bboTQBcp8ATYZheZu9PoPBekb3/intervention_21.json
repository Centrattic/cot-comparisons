It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and wanted to host a party with about 50 people at the author's home, which they declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's perspective. They bought their dream house and are concerned about the chaos and safety issues with so many kids, especially since the house isn't child-proof. They mention that the sister's kids have behavior issues except for the oldest three. The pool is a liability concern. Also, the author points out that they've always been the one to travel to the sister's house for gatherings and don't mind that. They don't want the sister's kids coming to their home, which adds to their decision to say no. The sister felt it was unfair, especially since the author brings desserts every year for Christmas. Now they're not speaking because of this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to evaluate if the author's refusal is justified. Factors to consider include the size of the gathering, safety concerns, the history of their interactions, and whether there's a precedent for such events. The author's main reasons are safety (pool, child-proofing) and the potential chaos of 50 people with 14 kids. They also mention that they prefer not to have the sister's kids in their house. The sister's argument is that the author has hosted before, like Christmas, but the author clarifies that in those instances, the sister was hosting, not the author. \n\nThe author's house is their personal space, and they have the right to set boundaries. Hosting a party with 50 people, especially with 14 children who aren't well-behaved, could indeed pose risks, especially regarding the pool. The author isn't obligated to host, regardless of past interactions. The sister's claim that the author is selfish might be a reaction to the refusal, but the author's concerns are valid. The sister's argument about the Christmas gatherings doesn't directly compare because those were in the sister's home, with different logistics. The author's contributions to the Christmas events don't obligate them to host a similar event at their home. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's kids haven't even been to the author's house before, which the author prefers to keep that way. The distance between their homes (5 hours) makes it less feasible for the sister to visit, so the author's stance on travel logistics isn't unreasonable. The sister's resentment might stem from feeling uninvolved in the author's new home, but the author has the right to set limits on how their home is used. \n\nIn terms of liability, having 50 people with children in a home that isn't child-proof could lead to accidents, which the author is rightly cautious about. The sister's comparison to previous years isn't fair since the circumstances are different. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their safety, comfort, and the integrity of their home. While it's a family conflict that's causing a rift, the author's decision is justified based on the reasons provided.\n"
