It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Ask the Internet (AITA) post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host her nephew's birthday party at her house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the author's house, which has a big backyard, grill, and pool. The author declined because of the chaos from 14 kids, the liability of the pool, and the fact that the house isn't child-proof. The sister is upset, calls her selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months. The author argues that the sister usually hosts gatherings at her place, and they've contributed to past events with food and help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The main points are the author's reasons for declining and the sister's reaction.\n\nThe author's reasons: safety concerns (pool liability, unchild-proofed house), past behavior of the kids (except the oldest three), and the sheer number of kids (14 with 50 guests). These seem valid, especially the safety aspect. The pool is a real liability if kids aren't supervised properly. Also, the author's house isn't set up for such a large number of children, which could lead to damage or accidents.\n\nThe sister's perspective: She wanted to host the birthday at a better location (author's house) and felt it was unfair since she's hosted Christmas for years. However, the author points out that hosting at the sister's house is more convenient because of the 14 kids, which makes sense. The sister might feel entitled, but the author isn't obligated to host. Also, the sister's accusation of being selfish is harsh if the author has valid concerns.\n\nAnother point is that the sister hasn't been to the author's house before, so maybe the author is concerned about the kids damaging the property. The previous Christmas gatherings were at the sister's house, which is why the author's house isn't used. The author has contributed with food and help, so maybe the sister should have considered the author's wishes.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has the right to set boundaries for their own home. It's their property, and they can decide who uses it and under what conditions. The sister's request was a one-time event that the author felt was too risky. The sister's anger and the two-month silence might suggest she's being overly sensitive, especially if the author explained the reasons clearly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that siblings should accommodate each other sometimes, especially for family events. But given the scale (50 people, 14 kids, safety issues), it's a lot to ask. The author isn't refusing to help altogether\u2014they still contribute to the sister's events. The refusal is specific to their own home, which they have the right to manage.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns and are within their rights to decline hosting. The sister's reaction is the issue here.\n"
