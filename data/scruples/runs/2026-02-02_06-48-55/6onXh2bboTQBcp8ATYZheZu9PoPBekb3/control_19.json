It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's sister wanted to host her nephew's birthday at their house, but they said no. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. The sister is upset and called them names, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. They have a dream house, which they probably want to protect. Having 50 people over with 14 kids might be a lot. The author mentions that their house isn't childproof, which is a valid safety concern, especially with the pool. Drowning is a serious risk, so that's a legitimate reason to be cautious. Also, the sister's kids are not well-behaved except for the oldest three, which adds to the concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister argues that the author has hosted other events before, like Christmas, but those were at the sister's house. The author says they don't mind traveling to the sister's place but the sister is now asking them to host here. The author also mentions contributing to food and helping with chores at the sister's events, so they've been involved in other ways.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a reasonable reason to say no. The author's reasons are safety, avoiding chaos, and protecting their property. These are valid personal choices. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to host if they don't feel comfortable. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's boundaries are understandable. \n\nAnother angle: the sister's kids have never been to the author's house, which the author prefers. Maybe there's a history of tension or past issues that aren't mentioned here, but based on the given info, the author's stance seems justified. The comparison to previous years' Christmas events isn't quite the same scenario because hosting a birthday with a pool and 50 people is different from contributing desserts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for declining, especially regarding safety and the potential for disaster with so many kids. The sister's anger might be misplaced if the author clearly communicated their concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
