It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing their sister's request to host her kid's birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has concerns about safety and the chaos that might come with it. They bought their dream house and don't want their sister's kids to come there because they haven't been before, the kids aren't well-behaved, and there's a pool that could be a liability. The sister is upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months. The sister also points out that the author has hosted Christmas for 10 years, but the author says it's more convenient at the sister's place because of the 14 kids.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author has a valid reason for saying no. They have their own home, and hosting 50 people with 14 children might be overwhelming, especially given the safety concerns with the pool. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house before, which might mean the author isn't familiar with their behavior in that environment. Also, the author mentions they contribute to the Christmas gatherings by bringing dessert, so they've been part of the family events in the past, but this is a different scenario. \n\nThe sister is upset and called the author names, but the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their property. The key factors here are the safety of the pool, the potential chaos with 14 kids, and the author's comfort in letting strangers (the sister's kids) into their home. The sister's argument about past Christmas events might not be a fair comparison if the circumstances are different. Hosting a birthday party with a large number of kids in a home that's not child-proof is a legitimate concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's request could be seen as reasonable if she's trying to avoid the hassle of traveling with her kids to the author's place. But the author's house is a 5-hour drive away, so maybe that's why they usually meet at the sister's place. The author isn't refusing to host any events but specifically this birthday party due to the reasons mentioned. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They have a valid reason based on safety and the nature of the event. The sister might feel slighted, but the author has the right to protect their property and ensure safety. The sister's reaction might be overblown, especially if the author has consistently contributed in other ways. The answer would likely be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
