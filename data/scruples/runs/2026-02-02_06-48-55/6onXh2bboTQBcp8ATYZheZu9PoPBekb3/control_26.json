It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they made a mistake by not letting their sister host the birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The author lives 5 hours away, so it's not like the sister just randomly decided to host there. They usually meet at the sister's place because it's easier for her to manage all the kids. The author doesn't mind traveling to her sister's house, which shows she's been accommodating in the past.\n\nThe sister asked to use the author's house for the birthday party, which includes the backyard, grill, and pool. The author declined because the house isn't childproof and the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. So there's a safety concern here. The author is worried about children drowning in her pool, which is a valid concern, especially with 50 guests and 14 kids.\n\nThe sister called the author selfish and an asshole, but maybe she didn't consider the author's valid safety concerns. The author points out that they've been hosting Christmas at the sister's house for 10 years, but that's a different context. Managing a birthday party for 50 people with 14 kids in a house that's not set up for that could be a different scenario. The author also contributed to Christmas meals, so maybe she's already been helping in other ways.\n\nThe sister's argument might be that since they usually host events at her place, this time it should be the author's turn. But the author has a valid reason to say no, especially regarding safety and the setup of her home. The author isn't being selfish just because she doesn't want to host; it's about practicality and safety. Plus, the sister didn't consider that the author's home isn't suitable for such a large, chaotic event.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's refusal is justified. The sister's reaction might be over the top, and the author isn't in the wrong here. The key points are safety, the impracticality of the setup, and the sister not respecting the author's personal space and concerns.\n"
