It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has a dream house but doesn't want the chaos. \n\nThe sister asked to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author declined, citing concerns about the kids' behavior, liability with the pool, and their house not being child-proof. The sister called the author selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they bought their dream home, maybe want to protect it from potential damage or chaos. The kids aren't well-behaved except for three, and the pool is a liability. They might be worried about safety and stress.\n\nThe sister's perspective: She's hosting a birthday, which is a significant event. The author has attended her Christmas gatherings for 10 years, bringing food. She might feel that the author is now refusing without a valid reason, especially since previous gatherings were at her house.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to say no to hosting. It's their property, and they have legitimate safety concerns. However, the sister might feel it's a family obligation or that the author is being unfair compared to past help. But the author has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own home. The sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong if they clearly state their reasons. The key points are property rights and the author's responsibility for their home. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
