It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (AITA) has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the author's house, which has a backyard, grill, and pool. The author refused, and now the sister is upset, calling them selfish. They haven't spoken in two months because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the reasons the author gave for saying no. The main points are:\n\n1. The sister's kids are not well-behaved except the oldest three. The author's house isn't \"child-proof,\" which I take to mean it's not safe for young kids. The pool is a concern because of drowning risks. So the liability is a big worry here.\n\n2. The sister usually hosts gatherings at her own house because it's more convenient for her with 14 kids. The author usually travels to their place instead. The sister's Christmas gatherings have been at her house for over a decade, and the author contributes desserts each year. So the author has been helping in the past but says no to this specific event.\n\n3. The sister is upset and called the author names. The author is now being blamed, but the author feels they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author right to say no? Well, considering the safety aspect. If the author's house isn't child-proof and they have a pool, allowing 50 people including 14 kids could be risky. The author has a right to protect their property and ensure safety. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the potential for problems.\n\nAlso, the sister hosting at her own home is more practical because she has the space and the kids are already there. The author has been helping by providing desserts and others help with cooking and cleaning. So the author isn't being selfish if they're not wanting to host such a large event at their house, especially with the safety concerns. The sister might be expecting the author to accommodate, but the author has valid concerns about liability and the chaos that 14 kids could cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel hurt or think the author is being unfair, especially if they've always hosted at her place before. But the author's reasons are about safety and their own home's preparedness. It's their house, and they have the right to decide how to use it. The sister's reaction might be a bit over the top, but the author's reasoning seems reasonable.\n\nSo I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have valid safety concerns and the sister should understand that the author's house isn't suitable for such a large, chaotic event.\n"
