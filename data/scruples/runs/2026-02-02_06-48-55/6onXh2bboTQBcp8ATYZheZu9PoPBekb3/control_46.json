It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream house, and the sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a nephew's birthday with 50 guests. The author said no, and the sister was upset, calling them selfish. The author's reasons are that the kids aren't well-behaved (except the oldest three), the house isn't childproof, and the pool is a liability. The sister had hosted Christmas there before, but the author thinks it's different. They've contributed to the Christmas food for years, but now the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, the main point is whether the author was wrong to refuse. The sister's request is pretty big\u201450 people in a house that's not designed for that. The author's concerns about safety, especially the pool, make sense. Hosting 14 kids is already tough, but adding 50 guests might be overwhelming. The author is prioritizing their own property and safety, which is their right. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that since the author has the space, they should contribute more. But the sister has a history of hosting big events at her own home, so maybe the author isn't obligated to host this. The author's contribution to the Christmas events shows they've been helpful before. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained their reasons. The sister's kids haven't even been to the house, so maybe the author isn't being selfish but protecting their own space. \n\nLiability is a big factor here. If something happened at the pool, the author could be held responsible. They have a right to set boundaries for their home. The sister's accusation of selfishness might be misplaced because the author is considering their own comfort and safety. There's also the distance\u20145 hours away, so maybe the sister didn't think through the logistics of bringing 14 kids that far for a party. \n\nThe fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests a big rift, but the author's stance seems reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author had valid reasons to decline based on safety, property, and personal boundaries.\n"
