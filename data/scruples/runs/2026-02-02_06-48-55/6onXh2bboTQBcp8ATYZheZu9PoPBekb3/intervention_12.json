It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author is clearly uncomfortable with. The house is their dream home, and they\u2019re worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool.\n\nThe sister felt hurt and called the author selfish, leading to a two-month silence. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They bought a dream house with their husband. Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids, especially with the pool involved, sounds like a lot. The author has valid concerns about safety and the potential for chaos. They also mention that their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. That's a lot of responsibility, and the liability of a pool is a real concern. Plus, they\u2019ve been hosting events at their sister\u2019s place before, contributing with desserts and helping out, so maybe they feel they\u2019ve already given enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset because she wanted to host at a more convenient place (the author's house) and felt it was a favor. She might feel that the author is being selfish, especially since they\u2019ve done this for Christmas for years. The fact that they haven\u2019t spoken in two months shows the tension here. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their own space, liability concerns, and the sister's expectations versus the author's boundaries. The author had the right to say no, especially considering the risks involved. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she didn't consider the author's feelings and the practical issues. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they set a boundary to protect their home and safety. The sister should have respected that decision, even if she was disappointed. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the sister felt it was her only option, but the author had the right to decline. Yeah, B makes sense.\n"
