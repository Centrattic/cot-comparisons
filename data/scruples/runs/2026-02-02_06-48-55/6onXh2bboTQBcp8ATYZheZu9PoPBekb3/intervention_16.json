It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host the birthday party at her house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought her dream house, which is now her private property. Allowing a party with 50 people, including 14 children, could be overwhelming and risky, especially with the pool. The author mentions liability concerns, which are valid. Parents often worry about safety, especially with young kids and a pool.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10 years at her house, and the author contributed food. But the user points out that the situations are different. Hosting a birthday party at someone else's home with children who haven't been there before and potential safety issues isn't the same as contributing to a family gathering at the sister's home. The author had legitimate reasons for declining: safety, the chaos of 14 kids, and the fact that her house isn't \"child-proof.\" \n\nThe sister called the author selfish and an asshole, which seems harsh. The author didn't force the sister to host elsewhere, but declined based on her own comfort and safety. It's about personal boundaries and property rights. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to host, especially with such a large group and potential risks.\n\nAlso, the sister hasn't visited the author's house because it's a 5-hour trip with 14 kids, so it's not like they interact much. The author's refusal isn't about favoritism but about her own home's safety and sanity. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her home's safety and her own well-being, which is reasonable. The sister's reaction is more about feeling rejected or unappreciated, but the author's decision is justified.\n"
