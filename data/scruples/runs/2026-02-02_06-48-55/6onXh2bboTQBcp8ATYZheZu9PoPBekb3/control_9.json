It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is worried about chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They said no, and now there's a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author bought their dream house, which they probably want to keep in good condition. Having 50 people over with 14 kids who aren't well-behaved sounds stressful and risky. The pool liability is a valid concern too. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt because they've always met at her place, and maybe she expected a favor this time.\n\nThe author mentions that they usually go to her sister's place for gatherings, and they don't mind the travel. But this is a big event at the author's home. The sister called them selfish, but maybe the author is just being realistic about their own space and safety. The author has contributed to previous events with food and help, so they're not entirely not participating. \n\nFamily dynamics can be tricky. The sister might feel entitled because of past interactions, but the author's right to set boundaries with their own home is important. It's their property, and they can choose who uses it and under what conditions. The sister's kids haven't even been to the house before, so maybe the author has good reasons for that as well. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to their home, the safety concerns, and the fact that they've been accommodating before. The sister might need to understand that this request is different because it's a large event at the author's place. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're protecting their property and their peace of mind.\n"
