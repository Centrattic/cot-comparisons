It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The sister wanted to use the author's house for a party with 50 people. The author declined, and the sister got upset, calling them selfish. The author's reasons are about the chaos, the kids not being well-behaved, the pool being a liability, and the house not being child-proof. They also mention that the sister usually hosts big events at her own home, and the author has contributed to those in the past with food. Now the sister is upset, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to control their own property versus the sister's expectations. The author has valid concerns about safety and the potential disaster of hosting 50 people, especially with unruly kids and a pool. The sister's argument is that the author has hosted events at her house before, but the author clarifies that the sister's home is more practical for her 14 kids. The author has made contributions to those events, so maybe the sister expects reciprocity, but the author is setting boundaries now that they own their own house.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to say no to hosting something that could be a safety hazard and is beyond their comfort level. The sister's reaction seems excessive, given the author's valid concerns. The fact that the sister has never even brought the kids to the author's house before adds to the author's justification. So the answer is B.\n"
