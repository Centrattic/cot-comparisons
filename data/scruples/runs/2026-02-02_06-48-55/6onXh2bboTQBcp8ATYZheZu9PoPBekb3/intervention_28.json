It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is already a lot to handle. The author bought their dream home and is concerned about safety with the pool and the chaos of so many kids. They didn't say yes to the party, and now there's a rift.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: the sister's kids are hard to manage except for the oldest three. The house isn't childproof, and the pool is a liability. They also mention that 50 people are invited, which adds to the stress. The sister is upset because she's been hosting Christmas for years at her place, but the author points out that the setup is different. The sister feels slighted, maybe thinking the author isn't supporting family gatherings.\n\nBut the author also notes that they usually visit the sister's place, not the other way around, because traveling with 14 kids is a nightmare. So maybe the author is justified in not wanting to host such a large event, especially with safety concerns. The sister's reaction of calling them selfish seems harsh given the author's valid concerns. However, the sister might feel that the author isn't helping out with the family obligations, hence the argument about fairness.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author has the right to refuse, especially regarding safety. The liability of the pool is a big deal. The author isn't in a position to be forced to host. The sister's past hosting of Christmas doesn't mean the author should host this birthday. The author has been contributing in other ways (dessert, helping clean), so the sister's accusation might be misplaced. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
