It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The sister wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author declined, leading to a two-month silence and the sister calling her selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. She mentions her house isn't child-proof, the pool being a liability, and the potential for disaster with so many kids. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. The author lives 5 hours away, so maybe traveling to the sister's place is more feasible. The sister has hosted Christmas gatherings for years, but the author argues that's different.\n\nI should think about fairness. The sister has hosted big events before, so maybe the author's refusal is reasonable given the risks. The sister didn't consider the author's safety concerns. On the other hand, the sister might feel slighted, especially since the author usually travels to her place. But the author has valid safety and logistics issues. The sister's reaction might be over the top if she didn't consider the author's valid concerns. Also, the author offered to meet at the sister's place instead, which is where they usually meet. The sister's insistence on the author's house might be unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the author's refusal is justified because of safety and practical reasons. The sister's reaction might be too harsh. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
