It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They mention that the sister called them selfish, but the author has their reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream house and wants to protect it. Hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids is a big responsibility. The sister has never brought her kids there before, so maybe the author is justified in being cautious. The sister hosted Christmas gatherings for years, but that's a different scenario. The author contributes in other ways, like bringing dessert and helping with cleanup, so maybe they've done their part.\n\nThe sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author has valid concerns about safety and the mess. It's their home, and they have the right to set boundaries. The fact that they usually meet at the sister's place because it's easier for her to manage the kids makes sense. The author isn't refusing all family gatherings but is setting limits for their own well-being.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their property and safety, and the sister's reaction seems disproportionate. The author's reasons are reasonable, and they've made compromises in the past by attending events at the sister's place. The sister should respect the author's decision without cutting off communication for months.\n"
