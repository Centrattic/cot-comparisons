It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and she wanted to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author said no because of the chaos and safety concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. The house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. With 14 kids already being a challenge, adding 50 people might be overwhelming. Plus, the author mentions that their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three, so there's a risk of accidents or damage. The author also points out that they usually go to the sister's house for gatherings, not the other way around, so this is a shift in the norm.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels hurt and called the author selfish. She had hosted Christmas for 10 years, so maybe she felt this was similar. The author is contributing by bringing dessert each year, so they might feel they've helped enough. But the sister might see the birthday as a special event that requires more from the author.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. The sister's kids have never been there before, so the author isn't accommodating a regular situation. The main issue seems to be the sister's expectation based on past gatherings, but the author's refusal is about their own comfort and safety. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own home's safety and their peace of mind. The sister's reaction might be over the top, but the author had valid reasons. So the answer should be B.\n"
