It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has a big house with a backyard and pool. The sister wanted to host the party there but the author said no because of the chaos and safety concerns with the pool.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author's reasoning is that they don't want their house to be overrun by 14 kids, especially since the pool is a liability. They also mention that the sister has never brought the kids to their house before, so maybe this is a new request that's causing tension. The sister is upset, feeling that the author is being selfish, especially since the author usually goes to the sister's house for gatherings. \n\nI should consider the key points: the author's right to privacy and safety versus the sister's desire to host the party. The author bought their dream home, so they have the right to set boundaries about how their property is used. Safety is a major concern here, especially with a pool and many kids. The sister, on the other hand, might feel that the author isn't considering their family's needs or past contributions (like bringing desserts and helping with setup).\n\nBut the sister's argument is that they've always met at her house for the past 10+ years, implying that hosting at the author's house is a new request. The author might be justified in saying no because of the logistical challenges and safety issues. The sister's reaction seems harsh if the author is genuinely concerned about property use and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister feels that the author isn't being supportive as a family member, especially since the author usually travels to their place. The sister might feel that the author is turning the tables now. But the author has the right to refuse if they feel it's too much for them to handle. \n\nI need to balance the rights and responsibilities here. The author isn't obligated to host the party just because they asked. The key is whether the author's refusal is reasonable. Given the safety concerns and the fact that the sister's kids have never been to the house before, it's reasonable for the author to say no. The sister might need to accept that hosting at the author's house isn't feasible. \n\nSo the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to safety and personal boundaries. The sister's reaction is maybe a bit unfair if the author explained their concerns clearly.\n"
