It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The author bought their dream house, and the sister wanted to use it for a party with 50 people. The author said no and the sister is upset, thinking the author is selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons are about safety, especially the pool being a liability, and the chaos of 14 kids they've never had over. They also mention that in the past, they meet at their sister's house because it's easier for the sister to manage the kids. The sister is upset, comparing it to hosting Christmas for 10 years, but the author feels it's not the same because hosting a party with 50 people at their house is different and risky.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have valid concerns about safety. The pool is a big liability, especially with many kids. They also mention their house isn't child-proof. The author's house is their personal space, and they have the right to decide who uses it. The sister's kids haven't been there before, so maybe the author isn't responsible for accommodating them. The sister's argument about hosting Christmas might not be a fair comparison because that's a different scale and context. The author also contributes to the events by bringing dessert, so they're already participating, just not hosting.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel slighted, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing safety and their own comfort. The sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author an asshole. The author's reasons are legitimate, so they're not in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
