It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not allowing their sister to host her kid's birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author's house isn't child-proof. The sister was upset and hasn't spoken to the author in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author bought their dream house with their husband. They didn't want the sister to host the party there because of the 14 kids, liability from the pool, and the house not being child-safe. The sister had previously hosted Christmas gatherings for over a decade, but the author isn't comparing that to this. They also mention that they usually visit the sister's place instead of her coming to theirs because it's a 5-hour trip. The author provides dessert for 25 people each year, and their parents help with the event. \n\nThe sister called the author selfish and an asshole, leading to a two-month silence. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the reasons the author gave. Having 14 kids at a 3-year-old's birthday would be extremely chaotic. The author's house isn't set up for that many children, which could be a safety issue, especially with the pool. The author also didn't want to take the risk of kids drowning. That seems like a valid concern. \n\nThe sister's perspective is that she's been the one hosting big events (like Christmas) for years, and the author is refusing this time. But the author's situation is different: the sister is hosting a party at the author's home, which has a pool and isn't child-proof. The author might not have the resources or willingness to handle 14 kids and 50 guests. \n\nThe sister's argument that she's done the hosting in the past might not be fair because the author's refusal is for a specific event (birthday) that's different from Christmas. Also, the author is contributing in other ways (dessert, parents helping). \n\nThe author's main reasons are safety and the inherent chaos of 14 kids. Those are reasonable. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole might be harsh, but maybe the author should have handled the refusal more sensitively. However, the sister's kids have never been to their house, so maybe the author's stance is justified given the potential risks. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were justified. Here, the author's refusal is based on valid concerns, even if it upset the sister. The sister might feel entitled after years of hosting, but the author has the right to set boundaries for their own home. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They provided a valid reason for refusing, and the sister's kids haven't been there before, so the author isn't obligated to host. The sister's reaction might be the problem here.\n"
