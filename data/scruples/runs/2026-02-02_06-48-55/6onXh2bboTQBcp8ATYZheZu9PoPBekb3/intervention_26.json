It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the sister who said no to hosting the party) is in the wrong. The main points from the situation are:\n\n1. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the author's house with 50 people, using the backyard, grill, and pool.\n\n2. The author refused, citing concerns about the chaos, safety (pool liability), and the kids not being well-behaved. The sister took offense and called the author selfish, leading to a two-month silence.\n\n3. The sister argues that she's hosted Christmas for 10+ years, but the author points out the difference in scale (Christmas might have been at the sister's house with family help, while the birthday is a bigger event at the author's place with more people).\n\nNow, considering the author's reasons: they mention safety concerns (pool liability) and the logistical nightmare of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The house isn't \"child-proof,\" which is a valid safety issue. Also, the author has been contributing to past events by providing desserts and helping with cleaning. The sister's previous hosting at her own home was more manageable because she's where the kids are, and the author has to travel to help. \n\nThe sister's request seems to put a lot on the author without considering the practical aspects. The author's refusal is about protecting their property and safety, not just being selfish. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's reasons are valid. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't obligated to host. They've already contributed in other ways. The sister might feel slighted, but the author's decision is based on real concerns. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
