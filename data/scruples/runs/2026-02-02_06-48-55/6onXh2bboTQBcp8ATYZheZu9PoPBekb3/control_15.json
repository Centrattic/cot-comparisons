It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the writer bought a dream house they don't want to risk. The sister got upset and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has valid concerns about safety and liability, especially with the pool and the number of children. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids in a non-child-proofed house sounds risky. The author also mentions that they usually visit the sister's place for gatherings because it's more convenient for the sister's large family. \n\nThe sister is upset and called the author selfish, but the author isn't the one with the large family needing accommodations. The author has contributed in other ways, like providing dessert and helping with previous events. The sister's comparison to hosting Christmas is a bit different because those are family gatherings where the author might have more flexibility, but a birthday party is a different scenario with more specific risks.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to say no. Since they're not the ones with the large family and are prioritizing their home's safety, it seems reasonable. The sister's reaction might be a bit harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
