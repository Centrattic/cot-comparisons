It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and the author has a dream house with a pool, which they're worried about. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the sister wanted to host a birthday with 50 people at the author's house. The author says no because of the chaos, the kids' behavior, the pool being a liability, and their house not being childproof. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author mentions that the sister usually hosts big events at her own house, like Christmas, and the author contributes by bringing dessert every year. So the author feels like they've done their part in helping out. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house before, and the author prefers it that way. The main concerns seem to be safety (pool, not childproof) and the logistical nightmare of 14 kids plus 50 guests.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is wrong. On one hand, the sister is asking for a favor, and the author is setting boundaries for their own home. They have valid safety concerns. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt because the author is refusing her a big event in a convenient location. But the author doesn't have an obligation to let others use their home. They might have a right to protect their property and safety. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe the author could have explained their reasons more clearly or offered alternatives, like helping with the party elsewhere but not hosting. However, the sister's past hosting at her own home and the author's contributions (dessert, helping with cleaning) might show that the author has been cooperative in other ways. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't obligated to let their sister host at their house. They have a right to their own space and safety. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own home's safety and comfort. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
