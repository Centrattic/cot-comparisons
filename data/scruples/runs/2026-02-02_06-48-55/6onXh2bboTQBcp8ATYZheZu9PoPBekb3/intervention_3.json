It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a kid's birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds overwhelming. The author bought their dream house and doesn't want her sister's kids there because of safety concerns and the mess. They said no, the sister got upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons are about safety and their own comfort. They mention the pool being a liability and the kids not being well-behaved. They also point out that they contribute to other family events like Christmas by bringing dessert and helping with cleaning. The sister, on the other hand, sees hosting at the author's house as a way to avoid the hassle of bringing 14 kids to a 5-hour distance, and she's upset that the author refused, comparing it to past events.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's property, the safety of the kids, and the balance of contributions. The author has the right to say no to hosting, especially given the risks involved. The sister's frustration might stem from feeling that the author isn't contributing as much as they did in the past, but the author's contribution (dessert, help with cleaning) might not be the same as hosting a large event. Also, the sister's comparison to the Christmas event isn't fair because hosting a party is different from contributing to a shared event.\n\nThe author's decision is about their own safety and comfort, which is valid. They have a right to set boundaries, especially when it comes to their home and potential liabilities. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs in this case. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
