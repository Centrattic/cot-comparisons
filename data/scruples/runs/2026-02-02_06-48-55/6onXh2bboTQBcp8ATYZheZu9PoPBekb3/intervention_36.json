It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her sister host her nephew's birthday at her house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought her dream house and is worried about liability, especially with the pool. The sister got angry and they haven't talked in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons: safety concerns (pool liability), the chaos of 14 kids, and maybe not wanting her home to be used for large events. The sister's perspective: she's hosting a family tradition, maybe felt slighted since the author usually comes to their place, and now is being denied.\n\nThe sister's argument that the author has hosted Christmas events before might not be the same. Christmas is a big event, but maybe the author was okay with that because it's a family tradition and maybe the setup was different. The author mentions the pool as a liability, which is a valid concern. Also, her house isn't child-proof, which could lead to accidents.\n\nThe sister's kids haven't been to the author's house, so maybe the author isn't used to their behavior. If the kids are not well-behaved, that adds to the risk. The author also mentions contributing to other family events by bringing desserts and others helping with cooking and cleaning. So she's not refusing all family obligations.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe not. She's setting boundaries for her own home. It's her right to decide how her property is used. The sister's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling her selfish and an asshole. The author's reasons are practical and safety-focused. The sister might feel entitled, but the author isn't obligated to host. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister is taking it too personally. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's protecting her property and safety. The sister might need to respect that. Answer B.\n"
