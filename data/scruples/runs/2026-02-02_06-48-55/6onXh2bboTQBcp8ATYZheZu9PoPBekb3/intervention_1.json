It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author's house is a dream home. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party, but the author said no. The sister is upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's side. They mention that their house isn't childproof, which is a valid safety concern, especially with the pool. Having 50 people over, including 14 kids, could be a logistical nightmare. The author also doesn't want the kids coming to their house because of past experiences with the kids not being well-behaved. Plus, they've been meeting at the sister's house for Christmas for years, so maybe it's a pattern of convenience.\n\nOn the sister's side, she might feel that since the author's house is bigger and has the necessary amenities, it's a better place to host. She might believe that the author is being selfish, especially if they've never invited the kids before. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests that the sister feels wronged, but the author has their reasons.\n\nThe key points here are safety, convenience, and past behavior. The author's concerns about safety (pool liability) are legitimate. Hosting 50 people isn't trivial, especially with 14 kids. The sister might not have considered the author's perspective, especially since the author has a valid reason to be cautious. Also, the author mentions that they contribute to the food and help with cleaning, so they've been involved in other ways. The sister's comparison to hosting Christmas might not be fair because that's a different scenario with different numbers.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on practical reasons, not just being selfish. The sister's reaction might be overblown if the author clearly communicated their concerns and the reasons. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. The sister should have understood the safety issues and the logistical challenges. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
