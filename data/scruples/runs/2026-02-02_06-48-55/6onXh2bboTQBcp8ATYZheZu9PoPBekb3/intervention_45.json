It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author is concerned about liability, the chaos, and the fact that the house isn't child-proof. The sister felt hurt and called the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They bought their dream house, probably put a lot of effort into it. Hosting a big party with 14 kids and 50 guests would be stressful, especially with a pool. Liability is a real concern here\u2014kids in a pool can be dangerous. The author also mentions that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, so even more reason to be cautious. Plus, they didn't mention inviting the sister over before, so maybe they're setting boundaries now.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that since they usually meet at her place for big events, this was a fair request. She had hosted Christmas for years, so maybe she felt it was a balanced exchange. But the author isn't obligated to host. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author has valid reasons. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows it's a significant rift, but the author's safety concerns are legitimate. \n\nI think the key points are liability, personal space, and the author's right to set boundaries. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and safety. So the answer is B.\n"
