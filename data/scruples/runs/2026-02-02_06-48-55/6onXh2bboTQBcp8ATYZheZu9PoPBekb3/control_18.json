It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a kid's birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The sister had previously hosted Christmas gatherings with all the kids at her place, and the author usually visits there. Now, the sister wanted to use the author's house for a birthday party with 50 people. The author declined, citing safety concerns (pool, not child-proof) and the potential chaos.\n\nThe sister called the author selfish and an asshole. The author's reasoning seems logical: they bought their dream house, and the setup isn't suitable for a large kids' party. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, increasing the risk. The author has contributed to past events (desserts, help from parents), so they feel they've done their part.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted big events at her home before, but the author is pointing out that hosting at their house is different due to the pool and the number of kids. The author also prefers not to have the sister's kids in their home, which is a personal boundary. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their property. The sister's request might be reasonable from her perspective, but the author's concerns about safety and the impracticality of the situation are valid. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the potential risks involved. The sister might feel slighted, but the author's decision isn't necessarily selfish\u2014it's about protecting their home and safety. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
