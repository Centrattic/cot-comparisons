It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has 14 kids and usually hosts big events at her place because it's easier. The author bought a dream house and wants to keep it private. The sister wanted to use the author's house for the nephew's birthday, but the author refused, leading to a month-long silence.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author mentions that their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want chaos from the 14 kids and 50 guests. They also mention that they usually meet at the sister's place because it's more convenient, and they've contributed to the Christmas events with food and help from parents.\n\nThe sister called them selfish and an asshole, but the author is standing by their decision. Now, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The sister's side: she might feel that the author is being uncooperative or not supporting family traditions. But the author has valid concerns about safety and the state of their home. The sister's kids haven't even been to the author's house before, which might mean the author isn't comfortable with how their kids behave. The pool is a real safety hazard, especially with many kids. \n\nAlso, the author has been contributing to other family events, so maybe the sister is expecting them to take on more responsibility here. But the author has the right to set boundaries about their home. Hosting a party for 50 people with 14 kids is a lot, and the author might not want that stress or risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel it's a one-time event and the author is being too rigid. But considering the author's reasons\u2014safety, property, and the usual dynamic where the sister hosts\u2014it seems like the author is justified in saying no. The sister's argument about previous Christmas events doesn't hold because those might be different in scale and setup.\n\nSo, the author's decision is about protecting their property and safety. They aren't obligated to host, especially when it's not convenient and poses risks. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
