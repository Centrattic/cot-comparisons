It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. They usually visit the sister's place because traveling 5 hours with all those kids is a hassle. The author bought a dream house with their husband, and the sister wanted to host a 50-person party at their home. The author refused, and the sister called them selfish and an asshole. The author is concerned about safety, especially the pool since their house isn't child-proof. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three.\n\nThe sister brings up hosting Christmas for 10+ years, but the author thinks it's not a fair comparison. The author also points out that they contribute with desserts and their parents help with preparations. Now they haven't spoken in two months, and the sister thinks the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, safety concerns, and the sister's expectations. The author has valid reasons: safety, the number of kids, and the potential risk of the pool. The sister might feel hurt or offended, but the author has the right to set boundaries for their home. The sister's argument about past Christmas events might not be relevant here since the situations are different in scale and context. The author's contributions to past events don't obligate them to host this party. It's important to respect personal space and safety, especially when there are potential hazards. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own property and safety. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
