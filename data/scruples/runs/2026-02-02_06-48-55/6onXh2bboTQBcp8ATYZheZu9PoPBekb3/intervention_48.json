It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author's house is now their dream home. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author said no, and the sister got upset, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concerns are liability (pool safety, kids' behavior) and their house not being child-proof. The sister argues that the author has hosted Christmas at her house for years, contributing with desserts. The author feels it's different because hosting there is more convenient for the sister, but the author's home is a new, personal space they want to keep safe.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's request is for a large party that could be risky. The author has a right to protect their property and personal safety. The sister might feel entitled because of past interactions, but the author's reasons are valid. The sister's reaction might be overblown if the author explained the concerns clearly. However, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, but given the potential risks, saying no isn't unreasonable. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
