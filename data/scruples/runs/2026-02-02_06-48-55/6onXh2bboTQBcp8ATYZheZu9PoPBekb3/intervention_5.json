It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author's house is 5 hours away. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author said no, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. The author has a dream house, and they're worried about the chaos from 14 kids and 50 people. The pool is a liability. The sister argues that the author has hosted other events, like Christmas, but the user points out that they only meet a few times a year, and they usually travel to the sister's place. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, leading to a 2-month silence.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a right to their home and can set boundaries. Hosting a party for 50 people, especially with 14 kids and a pool, is a big responsibility. The author's concerns about safety and property are valid. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt or dismissed, especially if they've had a history of contributing to other events. However, the sister's request seems to be for convenience, not just the author's home. The distance is 5 hours, so maybe the sister was expecting the author to host despite the inconvenience. \n\nThe author's reasons are practical and safety-related. They don't want chaos in their home and are concerned about liability with the pool. It's not like they're refusing all the time; they meet a few times a year, but they go to the sister's place. The sister's comparison to previous events (Christmas) might not be valid because hosting a birthday party for a kid with 50 people is different. Also, the sister hasn't even brought her kids to the author's house before, which is another point. \n\nSo, the author has legitimate reasons to say no. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect their home and safety. The sister might need to accept that the author can't accommodate such a large event, especially with the risks involved. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision based on their own circumstances and safety concerns. The sister's reaction is unkind, but the author's refusal is justified.\n"
