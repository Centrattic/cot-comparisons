It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nSo the setup is that the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and they usually meet at her place because traveling 5 hours with all those kids is hard. The writer bought their dream house and when the sister asked to host a party there with 50 guests, the writer said no. The sister is upset, calling them selfish, and they haven't talked in two months.\n\nThe writer's reasons: their house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want kids drowning on their property. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. Plus, the writer doesn't mind going to the sister's house, which makes more sense logistically since the sister has so many kids.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister's request. Hosting a birthday for a nephew is a common family event. But the writer's house is 5 hours away from the sister's. So the sister would have to travel with 14 kids to the writer's house, which sounds extremely difficult. But wait, the writer mentions that they usually meet at the sister's house because it's more convenient for her to manage the kids. So maybe the sister is asking for something that's inconvenient for herself but expects the writer to accommodate it?\n\nThe writer's house isn't childproof and has a pool. Safety is a big concern here. Pools are a liability, especially with a large number of kids. The writer is within their rights to prioritize their safety and the safety of their property. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds another layer of risk. \n\nThe sister's response was to call the writer selfish and an asshole. That's pretty harsh, but maybe she felt hurt. However, the writer had valid safety concerns. The sister had hosted Christmas for years, but the writer points out that the situations are different. Hosting a Christmas gathering might be more about family tradition and maybe smaller in scale compared to a party with 50 people and 14 kids. The writer also contributed to the Christmas events by bringing desserts and helping with the work, so maybe they feel they've already given enough support.\n\nThe sister might feel that the writer is not being supportive enough, but the writer's reasons are about safety and practicality. It's not like they refused out of spite. The writer is trying to protect their home and prevent potential accidents. The sister's kids have never been to the house either, which the writer prefers. Maybe the writer doesn't want to invite the chaos of 14 kids into their new home.\n\nSo, considering all this, the writer's decision seems reasonable. They are setting boundaries to protect their property and safety. The sister might feel it's a refusal to help, but the writer's reasons are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
