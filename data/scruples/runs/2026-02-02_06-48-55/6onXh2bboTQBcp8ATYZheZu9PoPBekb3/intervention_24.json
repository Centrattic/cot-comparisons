It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. They usually visit the sister's place because traveling 5 hours with all the kids is a hassle. The author bought her dream house and when asked to host the nephew's 3rd birthday, she refused. The sister felt hurt, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months. The author cites safety concerns, liability from the pool, and the fact that her house isn't child-proof. The sister argues that the author has hosted other events before, like Christmas, but those were different because the author volunteered to help with food and other stuff, which she's done here by providing desserts each year.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's main reasons are safety and the logistical nightmare of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister's perspective is that the author is being selfish by not offering her space, especially since she's contributed before. But the author has a valid concern about the risk of having so many kids in her house and pool. It's her property, and she's within her rights to set boundaries. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author explained her reasons. The sister's previous hosting of Christmas doesn't mean the author is obligated to host this birthday. Also, the sister's kids have never been to the house, which the author prefers, adding another layer to her decision.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her home and safety, which is a reasonable stance. The sister's reaction of calling her names and cutting off contact for two months is more extreme. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. So, the answer should be B.\n"
