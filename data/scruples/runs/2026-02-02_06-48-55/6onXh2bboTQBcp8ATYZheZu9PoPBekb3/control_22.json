It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The writer explains that their sister has 14 kids, which they find chaotic. They bought their dream house and wanted to avoid the risk of having so many kids there, especially with the pool and backyard. The sister was upset and called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister wanted to host a party with 50 people at the writer's house, which is a significant number of guests. The writer is concerned about safety, liability, and the general chaos of 14 kids in their home. Their sister has hosted large gatherings at her own house for years, and the writer has contributed to those events in the past, like bringing desserts and helping with cleaning. \n\nThe writer's reasons for saying no are their own safety and comfort. They mention that their house isn't child-proof and that the pool poses a risk. These are valid concerns. Hosting such a large party would require a lot of work and could be stressful, especially with so many children. The sister's argument that they've done it for years at her house doesn't necessarily mean the writer is obligated to host now. Each situation is different, and the writer has the right to set boundaries for their own home.\n\nThe sister called the writer selfish, but the writer's reasons are about their own home's safety and their personal comfort. It's reasonable for someone to decline hosting a large event if they feel it's too much for them. The fact that the sister hasn't accepted the decision and cut off communication might be on her part, but the original question is about the writer's responsibility.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that they usually visit the sister's house instead of the other way around because it's easier for the sister to manage her 14 kids. So, maybe the sister expected reciprocity, but the writer isn't in the wrong for setting limits. The writer has a right to say no without being labeled the antagonist. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but the writer's decision is justified given the reasons provided.\n"
