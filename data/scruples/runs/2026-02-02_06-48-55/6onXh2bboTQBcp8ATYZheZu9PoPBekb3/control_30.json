It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The author has a dream house and is concerned about safety, especially with the pool. They mentioned that their sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author also points out that hosting a party with 50 people at their house could be a liability. \n\nThe sister is upset, called the author selfish and an asshole. They haven't spoken in two months. The sister brings up previous years when they hosted Christmas, but the author argues that the situations are different. The author has contributed to the event in other ways, like providing dessert and helping with cleaning.\n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, the author is setting boundaries. They have a right to protect their property and ensure safety. Hosting a party with that many kids, especially considering the age of the nephew (3 years old), could indeed pose risks. The author isn't refusing to participate entirely; they just don't want the event at their home. They've taken part in other ways, which shows they're not entirely unwilling to help.\n\nThe sister's reaction might be over the top. She's using past events to justify her request, but the author's reasons for declining are legitimate. The author's house is 5 hours away, so traveling with 14 kids is impractical. The author has a valid concern about the pool and property damage. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and safety. They've made alternative arrangements by attending the event at the sister's house. The sister's anger and the two-month silence suggest she might be overreacting. \n\nSo, considering all the factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have reasonable grounds to decline based on safety and practicality. The sister's reaction is more about feeling slighted than the author actually being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
