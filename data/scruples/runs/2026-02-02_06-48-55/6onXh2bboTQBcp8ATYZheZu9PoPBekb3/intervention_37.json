It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and asked to use the author's home for a 50-person party. The author declined, citing chaos, safety concerns (like the pool), and that their house isn't \"child-proof.\" The sister called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons seem valid. Hosting 50 people, especially with 14 kids, in someone else's home is a massive logistical challenge. Safety is a legitimate concern, especially with a pool. The author also mentions that their sister never brings her kids to their house, implying that the request is out of the blue. Plus, the sister has been hosting big events at her own home for years with family help. The author contributing desserts and the parents helping with preparation shows they've already contributed without hosting. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems over the top. Calling someone an asshole for declining a request, especially with valid reasons, isn't fair. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months suggests the sister is holding a grudge without considering the author's perspective. The author's boundaries are about their own home's safety and comfort, which is their right. \n\nThere's also the aspect of convenience. The sister has been the one hosting big events at her house with family assistance. The author isn't refusing all gatherings but is setting a boundary for this specific event. The sister's comparison to past Christmas events isn't a fair comparison because the context is different. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to control their property and safety. The sister's anger seems misplaced. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
