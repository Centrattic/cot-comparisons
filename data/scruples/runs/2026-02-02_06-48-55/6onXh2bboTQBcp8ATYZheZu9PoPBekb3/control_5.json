It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister wanted to host a birthday party at the author's house, but the author said no. The sister got upset and now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author has their own house, which is a dream home. The sister wants to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author is worried about safety, especially the pool being a liability. Also, the author mentions that the sister's kids haven't been to their house before, and they prefer it that way. The sister is upset and called the author names. The author also points out that in the past, they've helped with Christmas at the sister's house, contributing desserts and others helping with the work.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the author's right to say no, the safety concerns, and the sister's reaction. The author is responsible for their own property and safety. Hosting 14 kids plus 50 guests is a huge responsibility. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The author has valid reasons for refusing, especially regarding the pool and the potential for chaos. The sister's argument that she hosted Christmas for years doesn't apply here because this is a different situation\u2014specifically a birthday party at the author's home with many more people, including unfamiliar guests.\n\nThe sister's response was to call the author names, which is unkind, but the author's refusal was based on legitimate concerns. The author isn't obligated to host the party if they don't feel comfortable. The sister might feel hurt, but the author is prioritizing safety and their own space. Also, the author has been contributing to the Christmas events, so they aren't being selfish in terms of helping; this is a different request.\n\nSo, in terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on their own home's safety and their comfort level. The sister's reaction is harsh, but the author's reasons are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
