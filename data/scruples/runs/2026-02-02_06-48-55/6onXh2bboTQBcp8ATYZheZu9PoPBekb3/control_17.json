It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe sister has 14 kids, which I can imagine is a lot to manage. The writer bought their dream house and was asked to host the nephew's 3rd birthday, which would involve 50 people. The writer said no, and the sister called them selfish and an asshole. They haven't spoken in two months now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the writer gave for saying no. They mentioned that their house isn't child-proof, there's a pool which is a liability risk, and they don't want the kids, especially since the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. Plus, they don't want the kids coming to their house at all because of the chaos. The sister countered by saying she's hosted Christmas for years, but the writer argues that's different because of the number of kids and the convenience of hosting at her place.\n\nI should think about the key points here. The writer's home is their private property, so they have the right to set boundaries. Hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids, especially with a pool, could indeed pose safety risks. The sister's kids haven't been to the writer's house before, and the writer prefers it that way. The sister's argument about past Christmas events might not be a fair comparison if the circumstances are different (like the number of people and the specific risks involved).\n\nAlso, the sister is calling the writer selfish, but the writer is prioritizing their own safety and property. It's not uncommon for people to decline hosting large events, especially when there are potential hazards. The writer mentions contributing to the Christmas events in other ways, like providing desserts, which might show they've been cooperative in other ways. \n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. Even if the writer's reasons are valid, the sister's response of calling names and cutting off communication for two months might be excessive. However, the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong for saying no, not about the sister's reaction.\n\nSo, weighing the factors: the writer has valid safety concerns, they're protecting their property, and the sister's kids aren't well-behaved. The writer isn't obligated to host, especially considering the risks involved. The sister might feel hurt, but the writer's decision seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
