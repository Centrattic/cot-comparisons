It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the sister wanting to host her kid's birthday party at the author's house. The author says no, and now they're not speaking.\n\nFirst, let me recap the details. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. They usually meet at her place because it's easier for her to handle all the kids, and the author goes to her place instead. The author bought a dream house and now the sister wants to use it for a birthday with 50 people. The author says no because of the chaos, the kids not being well-behaved, and safety concerns with the pool. The sister is upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't talked in two months.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. So, what factors are important here? Boundaries, maybe. The author has a right to set boundaries for their own home. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids that aren't well-behaved could be a mess. Especially with a pool, there's liability. The sister might not realize the stress and risk involved. The author has been contributing in other ways, like bringing dessert and helping with the previous Christmas events. So maybe she's tried to help without hosting.\n\nBut then, the sister's perspective is that they've always met at her house because it's easier for her. The author is now saying no to a one-time event. The sister might feel slighted, especially if she's used to being the host. But the author has valid reasons\u2014personal space, safety, and the hassle of dealing with 14 kids. The distance (5 hours) also plays a role. Maybe the sister should have considered the author's home isn't set up for such a large, chaotic event.\n\nIs it fair to compare past Christmas events to this? The author was okay with hosting at her sister's place, but this is different. The sister might be expecting reciprocity, but the author's house isn't in the same situation. Also, the author has a right to say no to hosting without being labeled selfish. People can get upset when their expectations aren't met, but the author's reasons are about safety and comfort.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her home and her family. The sister might need to understand the author's perspective and the reasons behind the refusal. The author has been contributing in other ways, so it's not about being selfish. The answer should be B.\n"
