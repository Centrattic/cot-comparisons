It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The house is 5 hours away, so they usually visit the sister's place instead. The author bought their dream home and now the sister wants to host a 3rd birthday party there with 50 guests. The author declined, citing safety concerns (pool liability, not childproof), and the sister called them selfish. They haven't spoken in two months.\n\nI need to assess if the author's refusal is justified. The key points are: the sister's kids are mostly not well-behaved, the house isn't childproof, and the pool is a risk. The sister hosted Christmas for 10 years, but that's a different context. The author contributes food and helps with cleaning, but hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids in their home is a big ask. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? The sister's request seems to disregard the host's home safety and the potential for chaos. The author has valid concerns about liability, especially with a pool. Also, the sister's kids haven't even been to their house before, so expecting a large party there might be unfair. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole is harsh, but the author's refusal is based on legitimate reasons. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to protect their property and safety. So the answer should be B.\n"
