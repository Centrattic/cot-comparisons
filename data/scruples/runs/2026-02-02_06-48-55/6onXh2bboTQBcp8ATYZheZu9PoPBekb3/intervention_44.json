It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author's house is 5 hours away. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party. The author said no, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. They mentioned their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want kids drowning. Also, they prefer their sister's kids not to come because they're not well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister felt it was selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas at her house for 10+ years, implying that this should be similar. But the author points out that the Christmas gatherings are at the sister's place because it's easier with 14 kids. The author has contributed to the Christmas events with desserts and help, but the sister is now asking for a different favor.\n\nI need to weigh the author's concerns against the sister's needs. The main points are safety (pool, unchild-proofed house) and the stress of hosting 14 kids plus 50 guests. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house, so maybe the author has a valid fear of chaos. Also, the distance\u20145 hours is a long travel time for kids. The author might be protecting their property and safety, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author isn't being supportive, especially since the author has hosted at their house before. But the Christmas example was different because it's their sister's home, not the author's. The author might feel that this specific request is too much, given the liability and their own home's setup.\n\nThe sister's reaction of calling the author selfish and the two-month silence suggests hurt feelings, but the author's reasons are about safety and practicality. It's not just about being selfish; it's about preventing a potential disaster. The sister might not see the safety concerns, but the author has a responsibility as a homeowner to prevent accidents.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision is based on legitimate concerns. They\u2019re not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
