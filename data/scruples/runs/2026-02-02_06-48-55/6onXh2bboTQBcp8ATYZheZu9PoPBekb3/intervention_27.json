It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author has a new house that's not childproof. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool, but the author refused. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main concerns are safety, especially with the pool being a liability, and the general chaos of 14 kids. They also mention that they usually travel to their sister's place for gatherings, not the other way around. The sister, on the other hand, might feel that since the author has a bigger space, it's a good opportunity and that the author should be more accommodating, especially since they've hosted Christmas events before.\n\nBut the key points here are the author's reasons. They didn't agree to host because of the risks involved with their own kids and the safety of the guests. Also, their house isn't childproof, which adds to the stress. Hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids could indeed be overwhelming and potentially dangerous. The author also mentions that they've always gone to their sister's house for gatherings, so maybe there's a pattern here. The sister might have expected a favor since the author has hosted other events in the past, like the desserts for Christmas. But the author draws a line here, perhaps because the new house is a personal space they want to keep their own.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone an asshole over a refusal, especially when the reasons are valid, might be a bit over the top. The author isn't obligated to host the party, especially with the specific risks mentioned. The fact that they have a history of meeting at the sister's house because it's more convenient for her (due to the number of kids) supports that. The author is making a reasonable decision based on their own circumstances and safety. The sister's argument about past hosting doesn't hold because each event has different factors\u2014Christmas is for family, a birthday might be more for friends and relatives, and the pool adds a new layer of risk.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns and have already contributed in other ways. The sister's expectation might be unreasonable given the context. The answer should be B (No).\n"
