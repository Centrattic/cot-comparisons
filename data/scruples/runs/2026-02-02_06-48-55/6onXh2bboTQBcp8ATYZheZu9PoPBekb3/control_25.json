It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister with 14 kids wanted to host her kid's birthday at the author's house, but the author said no. The sister is upset and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. The house isn't child-proof, and there's a pool which is a liability. The sister has a lot of kids, and her kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author is worried about the chaos and safety. The sister had hosted Christmas gatherings before, but the author is saying that's not the same because hosting a party for 50 people at their house is different. The author also mentions that they usually go to the sister's house and that they've contributed food in the past, so maybe they feel they've already done their part.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that since the author has the space and the resources (like a backyard and pool), they should be able to host. Maybe she didn't consider the author's concerns about safety and the number of kids. But the author has a right to their own property and to set boundaries, especially regarding safety. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house, so maybe the author is justified in not wanting the potential chaos there. \n\nThe key points are safety (pool liability) and the author's personal comfort. The sister's argument about past Christmases might not apply because that's a different scale and setting. Also, the author has been accommodating by going to the sister's place and providing food. The sister calling the author selfish and an asshole seems harsh, given the author's valid concerns. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to protect their home and safety. The sister should respect that. Answer B.\n"
