It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids and her house is already chaotic. The writer bought their dream home and doesn't want the sister's kids there. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The writer refused, mainly because of liability with the pool and the kids being a mess. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safety concerns (pool liability, kids behavior), the inconvenience of hosting 14 kids plus 50 guests, and past contributions to other events. The sister's argument is that the writer has hosted Christmas before, but the writer didn't host the sister's Christmas parties. The sister's Christmas gatherings are at her house because it's more convenient for her to manage 14 kids. The writer has contributed food each year, so maybe they feel they've done their part.\n\nThe question is whether the writer's refusal is justified. On one hand, hosting such a large party with many kids in a new home could be risky. Pools are dangerous, especially with many children. The writer has a right to protect their property and safety. On the other hand, maybe the sister felt it was a reasonable request, especially since prior events were at the writer's home (Christmas). However, the writer clarifies that past Christmas events were at the sister's house because it's more convenient for her. The writer's home is 5 hours away, so maybe it's not as feasible for the sister to travel with all the kids. \n\nThe sister might feel the writer is being inconsistent if they hosted Christmas at their house. But the writer explains that Christmas was at the sister's house because of the convenience. The writer's home is 5 hours away, making it impractical for the sister to visit with all her kids. Therefore, the refusal might be reasonable given the logistical challenges and safety concerns. The writer has valid reasons related to safety and the potential for chaos, which could be seen as justifiable. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the writer isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own home's safety and comfort.\n"
