It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking whether they're in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the person bought a dream house they're protective of. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The person declined, and now there's a 2-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions their sister's kids are not well-behaved, except for the oldest three. The house isn't childproof, and there's a pool which is a liability risk. They don't want kids drowning on their property. Also, the sister's kids have never been to their house, which they prefer. \n\nThe sister argues that the author has hosted Christmas for 10 years at her place, but the author points out that the sister has 14 kids, making it easier for family gatherings there. The author has contributed with desserts and help from parents each year, so maybe they feel they've balanced things out.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their property and safety concerns. They have a valid reason to be cautious about having 50 people plus 14 kids in a house that's not set up for that. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision is about safety and personal boundaries. Hosting a party of that size with young kids in a non-childproof house could indeed be risky. The sister's past hosting doesn't negate the current situation's specific risks. The author isn't obligated to open their home to such a large group, especially with potential dangers involved. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
