It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask the Family (AITA) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister declining her sibling's request to host a birthday party at her house because of the chaos and safety concerns. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author wants to avoid the hassle. The author bought her dream home and is worried about the kids' behavior and pool safety. The sister called her selfish, but the author has reasons: liability, previous inconvenience, and not wanting her kids there.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries for their property. The author isn't obligated to host just because the sister has done so in the past. The sister's comparison to Christmas events might not be fair since hosting a birthday with 50 people is different. Also, the author mentions contributing to the Christmas events with desserts, so she's already helping in her way.\n\nThe sister's reaction (calling her names and cutting off communication) seems harsh. The author's main concerns are valid: safety (pool liability) and the logistical nightmare of 14 kids plus 50 guests. The fact that her house isn't \"child-proof\" adds to the risk. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should be accommodating. But given the circumstances\u2014distance, the number of kids, safety issues\u2014it's reasonable for the author to say no. The sister's demand to host at her aunt's house without considering the author's situation could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her home and prioritizing safety, which is a responsible decision. The sister's reaction is more extreme, and the author isn't obligated to host. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
