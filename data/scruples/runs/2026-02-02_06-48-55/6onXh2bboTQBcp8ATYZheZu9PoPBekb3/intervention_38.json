It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids and asked to use the author's backyard, grill, and pool for a party with 50 people. The author declined, citing safety concerns and the chaos her sister's kids would cause. The sister is upset, called her selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasons: her house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and the kids are mostly not well-behaved. The sister's argument is that the author has hosted other gatherings and contributed with food in the past, so this should be similar.\n\nThe author mentions that they usually meet at the sister's house because of the 14 kids, and she doesn't mind traveling to their place. But hosting at her house would mean more stress and risk. The sister's party is a big event, and the author is worried about safety, which is a valid concern. The pool being a liability adds to that.\n\nThe sister is upset because she feels the author is being unfair, especially since she's been hosting Christmas for years. The author counters by saying the sister's kids have never been to her house and that the situations are different. The sister feels the author isn't contributing enough, but the author points out she provides desserts and others help with the cooking.\n\nI need to consider if the author had a valid reason to say no. Safety concerns are a strong point. If the pool isn't secured properly, it could be dangerous. Also, handling 50 people plus 14 kids might be overwhelming for the author's home. The sister might not realize the specific risks involved or the stress it would cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author isn't being supportive, given their history of hosting at her place. Maybe the author could have offered alternatives, like helping with the party at the sister's house or finding another venue, but she didn't. Instead, she just said no, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points are the author's safety concerns versus the sister's feelings of being snubbed. The author's reasons seem legitimate, especially the pool liability and the kids' behavior. But the sister's perspective is that the author isn't being fair. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person had a valid reason without being overly controlling. Here, the author's reasons are safety and practicality, which are valid. The sister's response of calling her names and cutting off communication might be seen as overreacting, but that doesn't negate the author's right to say no. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
