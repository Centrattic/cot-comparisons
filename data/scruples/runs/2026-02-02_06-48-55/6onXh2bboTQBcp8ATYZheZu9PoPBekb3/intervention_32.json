It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids and wanted to use the author's new house for a party with 50 people. The author declined, and now there's a two-month silence because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought a dream house with their husband, which they probably don't want to risk. The sister's kids are not well-behaved except the oldest three. The pool is a liability concern. The author also mentions they've contributed to other family events, like providing dessert every year for a decade. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, and the author feels it's a recipe for disaster.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's reasons are about safety and personal space. They have valid concerns about the pool and the number of kids. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids could be overwhelming, especially if the house isn't child-proof. The sister's argument is about past events, like hosting Christmas for 10 years, but the author points out that those events were organized in a way where the author contributed without having to host. The sister might feel entitled, but the author's home is private and they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the sister expected to share the responsibility or thought it was fair to use the bigger space. But the author clearly communicated their needs and reasons. The sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole seems harsh, especially if the author provided their reasoning. The fact that the author has been contributing to other events (desserts, helping with food) shows they aren't being stingy but are prioritizing their own comfort and safety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision is about protecting their property and ensuring safety. They aren't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. The sister's response might be more about feeling slighted rather than the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
