It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic and potentially dangerous, especially with the pool and the number of people. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author bought their dream house, which is a personal space they might value. Hosting 14 kids plus 50 guests could be overwhelming. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved, and the pool poses a safety risk. The author isn't against helping but prefers to meet at the sister's place, which makes sense given the logistics. The sister's argument about previous Christmas events doesn't seem directly relevant if the author is comfortable with their own boundaries.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone names and cutting off communication for two months is a strong response. However, the sister might feel slighted because the author isn't accommodating what she sees as a family event. But the author has valid concerns about safety and the stress of hosting such a large group, especially with children who might be unruly.\n\nThe author has contributed in other ways, like providing desserts and helping with clean-up, which shows they aren't entirely unwilling to support the family. The sister's insistence might be overstepping, especially since the author clearly has reasons for their decision. Personal boundaries are important, and it's reasonable to set them, especially regarding home safety and personal space.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have communicated their concerns more effectively. Instead of a flat no, perhaps suggesting an alternative location or setting conditions might have helped. But the sister's response of labeling the author as selfish seems extreme. The author isn't obligated to host, especially with the risks involved. \n\nIn family dynamics, expectations can sometimes be unspoken. The sister might have assumed the author would agree, given past interactions. However, the author has a right to prioritize their own comfort and safety. The key issue here is the sister's reaction versus the author's justified boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The sister's reaction is inappropriate, and the author's reasons are valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
