It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house.\n\nSo, the author has a sister with 14 kids. They usually visit the sister's house because it's easier. The sister wanted to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house, which the author refused. The sister is upset, says the author is selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months. The author is concerned about safety with the pool and the mess, plus the chaos of so many kids. They also mention that in the past, they've contributed to the food and their parents helped too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons for saying no: the chaos of 14 kids, the potential danger with the pool, and the fact that their house isn't \"child-proof.\" They also note that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister, on the other hand, feels it's unfair because she's hosted big events at her house before, and the author is being selfish. \n\nThe author bought their dream home, so maybe they want to keep it private. The sister is asking for a big event at the author's place, which is a significant commitment. The author might have valid concerns about safety, especially with the pool. Also, the sister's kids haven't been to the author's house before, so maybe the author isn't used to dealing with them. \n\nBut let's see. The sister is hosting a birthday for her nephew, which is a relative. The author is the aunt, so maybe there's an expectation that family events should be accommodated. However, the author isn't obligated to host. The sister's argument that they hosted Christmas for 10 years might not be directly comparable, since Christmas is an annual event and a birthday is a one-time thing. The author is contributing in other ways (food, parents helping), so maybe they feel they've already done their part. \n\nThe sister's call to the author a selfish and asshole is harsh, but the refusal might be justified given the safety and logistical issues. The author could have offered alternative solutions, like having a smaller party or hosting elsewhere, but they didn't. However, the author isn't required to host if they're uncomfortable. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author's decision is their own, and they have valid reasons. The sister's reaction is over the top, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
