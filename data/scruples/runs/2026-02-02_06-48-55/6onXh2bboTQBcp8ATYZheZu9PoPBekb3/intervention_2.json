It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing their sister's request to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which makes traveling to the author's house difficult. The author bought a dream house and is concerned about safety, especially with the pool. The sister got upset, called the author names, and now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a safety hazard, and hosting 50 people could be overwhelming. Plus, they mention the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The author has been contributing to the sister's Christmas parties by providing desserts, so they feel they've already given enough.\n\nThe sister, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being selfish, especially since she's hosted the Christmas gatherings for years. She might think that it's only fair to have the birthday at the author's place sometimes. The distance (5 hours) is a factor too; traveling with 14 kids isn't easy, so the sister might not have a choice but to host at a location that's manageable for her.\n\nBut the key points are about safety. The author's house isn't child-proof, and a party with 50 people, plus 14 kids, could lead to chaos. The pool being a liability is a serious concern. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety and the condition of their property. They have the right to set boundaries, especially since they've already been supporting the sister's events by providing desserts and helping with the work. The sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole might be an overreaction, but the author could have handled the refusal with more empathy, maybe offering alternatives like helping with the party at the sister's house or finding another venue.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't obligated to host. They've been accommodating in the past, but this is a different scenario. The sister hasn't been to the author's house with her kids before, so maybe expecting the author to host without prior experience is unreasonable. The author's reasons are valid and safety-focused, which is a strong argument in their favor.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to say no based on safety and practicality. The sister's feelings are hurt, but the author's decision is about protecting their home and avoiding potential disasters. The answer should be B.\n"
