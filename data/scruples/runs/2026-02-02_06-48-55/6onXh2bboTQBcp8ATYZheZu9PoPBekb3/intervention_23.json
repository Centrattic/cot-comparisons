It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author has a dream house they want to protect. They declined the request, leading to a fallout where they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mention liability concerns with the pool, the chaos of 14 kids, and that their house isn't child-proof. They also point out that they usually visit their sister's place for gatherings because it's more convenient for the sister to handle the kids. The sister called them selfish, but the author feels their decision is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister argues that the author has hosted other events in the past, like Christmas, and the author has contributed with food. The sister might feel that this is a one-sided arrangement, especially if the author is always going to their place. The author's refusal could be seen as not reciprocating. But the author has valid concerns about safety and the stress of hosting such a large group, especially with the pool.\n\nI need to weigh the reasons. Is the author being selfish, or are they protecting their property and safety? The sister's reaction is strong, but maybe she didn't consider the author's perspective. The author also mentions that their house is not child-proof, which is a legitimate safety issue. Plus, hosting 50 people with 14 kids could be overwhelming.\n\nBut maybe the author could have offered an alternative solution, like helping with the party in another way or finding a compromise. However, the author's main point is about the liability and stress. It's a tough call. The sister might feel slighted, but the author's concerns are real. I think the answer hinges on whether refusing the request was reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author has valid safety concerns and the sister didn't consider those, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
