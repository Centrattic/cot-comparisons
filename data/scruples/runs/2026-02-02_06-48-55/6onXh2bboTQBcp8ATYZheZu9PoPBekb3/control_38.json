It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids and has never brought them to the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author bought their dream home and is worried about the chaos and safety, especially with the pool. They refused the request, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The sister also mentions hosting Christmas for 10 years, but the author points out that the situations are different because of the number of kids and the setting.\n\nNow, the key factors here are the author's reasons for saying no. They mention liability with the pool, their house not being kid-proof, and the general chaos of 14 kids. Those are valid safety concerns. The sister's kids are not well-behaved except the oldest three, which adds to the risk. The author also mentions they contribute to the Christmas event with food and help from parents, so they're not entirely avoiding family responsibilities.\n\nThe sister is upset because she feels it's unfair, but the author has their own boundaries and valid reasons. The refusal isn't about being selfish but about protecting their property and ensuring safety. Plus, they meet at the sister's place out of convenience, which makes sense given the distance and number of kids. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary here. The sister's reaction might be over the top, but the author's decision is justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
