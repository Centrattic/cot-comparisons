It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister not allowing her to host her nephew's birthday party at her house. The key points from the description are:\n\nThe sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and usually, they visit her place because traveling that many kids 5 hours is a hassle. The author bought a dream house and turned down hosting the party because of the potential chaos, liability (pool safety), and her kids not being well-behaved. The sister is upset, called her selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reasons are valid. She mentions her house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and the kids aren't well-behaved. These are legitimate concerns, especially with a large number of kids. Hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids in a non-child-proof house could indeed be risky. The author also points out that she's contributed to previous events by providing desserts and helping with cleaning, so she's not entirely avoiding her part in family gatherings.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for years, but the author correctly notes that the Christmas events are at the sister's home, which is more convenient for managing 14 kids. The author's home, being 5 hours away, isn't a practical choice for the sister's kids to visit regularly, so the comparison might not hold.\n\nThe author's decision seems reasonable given the safety and practicality issues. She's not obligated to host family events, especially when there are valid safety concerns. The sister's reaction might be overly harsh, given the circumstances. Plus, the author has a right to set boundaries for her own home. The sister's resentment seems to stem from feeling slighted, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety and her own comfort.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
