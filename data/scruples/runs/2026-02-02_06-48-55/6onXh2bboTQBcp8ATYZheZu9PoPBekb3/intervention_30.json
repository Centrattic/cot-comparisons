It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister not allowing her sibling to host a kid's birthday at her house because of the sister's 14 kids and the chaos that would bring. The author (AITA) says they bought their dream house and don't want the kids there, especially the pool being a liability. The sister got upset and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about safety, their preference not to have the kids, and the logistical nightmare. The sister might feel slighted or that the author is being selfish, especially since the author previously hosted Christmas gatherings. But wait, the author says they've been meeting at the sister's house because it's easier with 14 kids. Hosting a birthday with 50 people, including 14 chaotic kids, at their own house is a big ask. The author has valid concerns about safety and their home. \n\nThe sister called them selfish and an asshole, which is harsh, but maybe the author overreacted? On the other hand, the author has a right to their own space and safety. The sister's argument about past Christmases might not be a fair comparison if the circumstances are different\u2014Christmas at the sister's house is for family, but a birthday party at the author's house with 50 people is a different scenario. The author also mentions contributing to the food, so maybe they feel their contributions are enough. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to set boundaries for their home and safety versus the sister's expectation based on past family gatherings. The author isn't in the wrong here because they have legitimate reasons for saying no. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's decision is understandable. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
