It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has 14 kids and has never hosted a party at the author's house. The author bought their dream house and declined the request because of the chaos and safety concerns, like the pool. The sister got upset and called them selfish, leading to a two-month silence.\n\nThe author's reasons include the logistics of 14 kids coming to their house, which is 5 hours away, safety issues with the pool, and the fact that the kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. They also mention that in the past, the sister hosted Christmas gatherings, but the author doesn't think it's the same. They contributed dessert and others helped with cooking and cleaning.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Key points: The author's house is their private property. They have a right to set boundaries. The sister made a request that could be risky and inconvenient. The author has a valid concern about safety and chaos. The sister's reaction might be unreasonable. The fact that they usually meet at the sister's house because it's easier for her to manage the kids makes sense. The author isn't refusing all gatherings but is setting specific limits. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're protecting their home and safety. The sister's request was for a large party with many kids, which the author isn't comfortable with. The sister's comparison to past Christmas gatherings might not be fair if the circumstances are different. The author isn't refusing to participate in family events but is choosing where and how. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole and the silence seems disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
