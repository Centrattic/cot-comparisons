It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. They live five hours away, and the author usually visits her sister's place for gatherings instead of the other way around. The author bought a dream house with her husband, and the sister wanted to host a 50-person birthday at the author's house. The author refused, and the sister is upset, calling her selfish. Now they haven't talked in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons are that her house isn't childproof, the pool is a liability, and she doesn't want her nephew's siblings (who aren't well-behaved except the oldest three) coming over. She also mentions that they all contribute to the Christmas event at the sister's house, so she's not being selfish in other ways.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's protecting her property and safety. The sister, on the other hand, might feel that the author is prioritizing her own comfort over family obligations. But the key points here are the number of kids, the distance, and the potential risks. The sister's kids have never been to the author's house, and the author prefers it that way. The sister's argument that they've hosted Christmas for years might not be directly comparable because the scale and location are different.\n\nI need to consider if refusing is reasonable. The author's house isn't set up to handle that many children, especially with safety concerns. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds another layer of risk. The author might be justified in refusing due to liability and personal space. However, the sister might feel it's a favor she's asking, and the author isn't accommodating. But given the circumstances, the author's reasons seem valid. The sister's past behavior (14 kids, chaotic) could make the author's refusal understandable. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting her home and safety. Answer B.\n"
