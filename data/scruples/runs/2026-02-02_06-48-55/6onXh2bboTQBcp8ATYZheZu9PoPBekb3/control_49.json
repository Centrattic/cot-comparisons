It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister with 14 kids, which is a lot. They usually visit the sister's house because traveling 5 hours with all those kids is a hassle. The sister wanted to host the nephew's 3rd birthday at the author's home, but the author said no. The sister is upset, calling them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons are that their house isn't child-proof, the pool is a liability, and they don't want chaos. The sister argues that she's hosted Christmas there for years, but the author points out that the Christmas gatherings are different because they meet at the sister's house due to the number of kids. The author also mentions contributing to the Christmas events with desserts and help from their parents.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, hosting a party with 50 people and 14 kids in a house that's not set up for that sounds risky. The author has valid concerns about safety and the potential for disaster. They also mention that the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. Plus, they've been doing their part by helping with Christmas events, so it's not about not contributing to family events. The sister's reaction seems harsh given the author's reasons. The author had every right to decline, especially considering the liability and the fact that the sister's kids haven't even been to their house before. The sister might be expecting too much without considering the author's comfort and safety. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
