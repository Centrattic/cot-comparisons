It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids and usually they visit her place. The writer bought their dream house and didn't want the sister to host there because of the chaos and safety issues like the pool. The sister got upset, called them selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and safety. The writer's house is their own, so they have the right to decide who uses it. The sister's kids are not well-behaved, and the writer is concerned about liability, especially with the pool. The sister hosting at her own home for Christmas with all the kids makes sense because it's her space, but the writer is not comfortable with 50 people plus 14 kids at their place. \n\nThe sister might feel entitled because they usually meet at her house, but the writer's reasons are valid. They mentioned the distance, safety, and previous issues with the kids. The sister's reaction of calling them an asshole seems harsh, especially if the writer explained their concerns. Also, the writer contributes to the Christmas gatherings with food, so they aren't avoiding responsibility. \n\nI think the writer is justified in setting this boundary. They have a right to protect their property and ensure safety. The sister's anger might stem from not respecting those boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
