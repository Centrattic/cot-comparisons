It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The author bought their dream house and the sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author declined, and now there's a 2-month silence. The sister called them selfish and an asshole.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the sister's request: hosting a party for one of her kids with 50 people. The author's main concerns are the number of children, their behavior (except the oldest three), and the liability of the pool. The sister has hosted Christmas gatherings for over a decade, but the author points out that those are probably different in scale and purpose. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's home and the reasons for declining. The author's house is their own, and they have a right to set boundaries, especially regarding safety and comfort. Having 14 kids already is a lot, and adding 50 guests including their children could be overwhelming. The pool is a valid safety concern, especially with many kids. The sister's past hosting at her own home doesn't obligate the author to do the same. \n\nThe sister might feel slighted, but the author's reasons are reasonable. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but maybe they didn't consider the safety and practical aspects. The author has been meeting at the sister's place for gatherings, but this time it's a specific request that's logistically challenging. The author also mentions contributing to food and cleaning, so they aren't entirely avoiding helping. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own home's safety and their comfort. The sister's reaction seems harsh, given the circumstances. The author's response was to decline, not to be mean, but to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
