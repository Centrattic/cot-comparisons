It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author said no, and now there's a two-month silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given by the author. They mention the chaos with 14 kids, the house not being child-proof, and liability with the pool. Also, they note that their sister usually hosts big events at her own place, and they contribute by buying dessert every year. The sister is upset and called them selfish and an asshole. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break it down. The sister is asking to use the author's home, which is a personal space. The author has valid concerns about safety and the number of children. They've never allowed their sister's kids to come over, which might be a factor. The sister's argument is that they've hosted at her house before, but the author's home is different. \n\nIs it fair to expect someone to host such a large event at their home? The author has a right to set boundaries, especially concerning their own property and safety. The sister might feel it's a family obligation, but the author isn't obligated to agree. The sister's reaction could be seen as overreacting, given the author's reasons. However, maybe there's a cultural expectation here that's not being met. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more polite or offered alternatives instead of a flat no. But they did mention they contribute in other ways. The sister's claim that the author is selfish might be harsh, considering the author's valid concerns. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to protect their home and safety. The sister's demand might have been unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
