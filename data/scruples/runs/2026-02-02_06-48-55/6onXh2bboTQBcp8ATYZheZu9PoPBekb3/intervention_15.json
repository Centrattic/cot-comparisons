It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting her sister host a birthday party at her house. The sister has 14 kids, and the author bought a dream house. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for a 50-person party. The author said no, and now they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about safety and the chaos of 14 kids. The house isn't child-proof, and the pool is a liability. She doesn't want kids drowning. That's a valid concern. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved except the oldest three. Plus, the sister never brings the kids to her house, which is 5 hours away. The author mentions that they usually meet at the sister's house because it's easier for her to manage the kids. She also contributed desserts for Christmas for years.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels hurt. She called the author selfish and an asshole. Maybe the sister felt that since they usually meet at her house, this was a time to switch. But the author has valid safety concerns. Hosting a party with 14 kids and 50 guests is a lot. The pool is a big risk. The author might not feel responsible to provide space for such a large event, especially when it's not their tradition to host at her house.\n\nThe sister's argument about hosting Christmas for 10 years might not be relevant. Christmas is a different scenario, maybe with family traditions. The author isn't obligated to open her home for a birthday party with those numbers. The sister might not have considered the author's boundaries and the practical challenges.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasons are safety and personal preference. The sister's reaction was harsh, but the author's refusal is based on valid concerns. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't required to accommodate her wishes if it's not safe or comfortable for her. Also, the sister hasn't visited the author's house before, so maybe the author isn't being selfish but rather setting boundaries for her own home.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a right to her home's safety and to set limits. The sister's reaction is over the top. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
