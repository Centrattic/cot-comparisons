It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. \n\nFirst, the key points: The sister has 14 kids, which the author finds chaotic. The author bought a dream house and doesn't want the sister's kids coming over because they're not well-behaved (except the oldest three) and the house isn't child-proof. The pool is a liability concern. The sister felt hurt, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nThe author's reasons are about safety and comfort. The sister hosted Christmas for years, but the author argues that's different because it's at the sister's place, which is more convenient for managing 14 kids. The author has contributed to past events with desserts and other help.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The sister's request was specific: a birthday party at the author's house. The author has valid concerns about safety (pool, kids' behavior) and their own space. The sister didn't ask before, so maybe the author isn't obligated. The sister's reaction seems harsh, but maybe she's frustrated. The author's refusal is based on legitimate reasons, not just selfishness. The sister's history of hosting might make her feel entitled, but the author's home is their own, and they have the right to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their home and safety. So the answer would be B.\n"
