It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which the author mentions is chaotic. The sister had asked to host a 3rd birthday party at the author's house, which is 5 hours away. The author declined, and the sister called them selfish. The author's reasons include the number of kids, the house not being child-proof, safety concerns with the pool, and the fact that they usually meet at the sister's place. They also mention that they contribute to the Christmas gatherings by bringing dessert each year.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to their own property, safety concerns, and the sister's reaction. The author is setting boundaries, which is understandable given the potential risks. The sister's argument about past Christmas events doesn't directly relate to the current situation. The author is being consistent in their approach\u2014usually they go to the sister's place, and now they're saying no to hosting due to specific concerns.\n\nThe sister's call-out as selfish seems harsh. The author is protecting their home and safety. The sister might feel slighted, but the author isn't obligated to host. The fact that the author contributes to other events (like dessert) shows they aren't completely avoiding family responsibilities. The author's decision isn't about being mean but about practical and safety reasons. The sister's reaction of cutting off contact for two months seems extreme compared to the author's request for not hosting a party. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're within their rights to set boundaries, especially regarding safety and personal space. The sister's response is more unbalanced. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
