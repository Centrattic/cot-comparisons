It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which they describe as chaotic. The author bought their dream house and didn't want the sister to bring all the kids there for the party. The sister called them selfish and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid concern about safety with the pool, especially with so many kids. Their house isn't child-proof, which adds to the liability. The sister's kids aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. Hosting 50 people with 14 kids could be a disaster. Also, the author mentions they usually go to the sister's place for gatherings, so this is a reversal of the norm.\n\nThe sister's argument is that she's hosted Christmas for 10 years there, but the author points out that the parents help with food and cleaning. The author isn't refusing all gatherings but is specific about the birthday party's risks. The distance between their houses (5 hours) might make it hard for the sister to come over, hence why gatherings are usually at her place.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to control their property against the sister's request. The author's concerns about safety and chaos seem legitimate. They also mention contributing to the Christmas gatherings with food, so they've supported their part in other ways. The sister's reaction of calling them selfish might be an overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their home's safety and their own comfort. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
