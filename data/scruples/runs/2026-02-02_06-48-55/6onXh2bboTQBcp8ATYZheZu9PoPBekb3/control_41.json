It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their sister to host a birthday party at their house. The sister has 14 kids, which is a lot, and the author bought their dream house. The sister asked to host a 50-person party, but the author said no. The sister called them selfish and an asshole, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid concern about safety, especially with the pool. They mention that their house isn't child-proof and that the kids aren't well-behaved. The sister usually hosts big gatherings at her own place, and the author doesn't mind going there. But hosting at the author's house would involve a lot of people, which could be risky and stressful.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel hurt because the author refused, especially if she's used to hosting and contributing to the food. The author did mention they've always gone to the sister's place before, so maybe the sister expected the same here. The argument is about whether the author overstepped by saying no.\n\nThe key points are safety concerns, the number of kids, and the author's right to set boundaries. The sister's reaction might be intense, but the author has a legitimate reason to refuse. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose perspective you take. The author's reasons seem reasonable, so they might not be in the wrong. The sister might feel slighted, but the author's safety concerns are valid. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
