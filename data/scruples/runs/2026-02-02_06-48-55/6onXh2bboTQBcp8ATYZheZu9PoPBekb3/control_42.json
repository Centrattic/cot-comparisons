It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their sister host a birthday party at their house.\n\nFirst, the author has a sister with 14 kids. The sister asked to host a nephew's birthday at the author's house, which would involve 50 people. The author declined, citing chaos, safety concerns with the pool, and not wanting their own kids to mix with the sister's kids, who aren't well-behaved except for the oldest three. The sister is upset, called the author selfish, and they haven't spoken in two months.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author has a valid reason for declining based on safety and the potential chaos. They mention not wanting kids drowning in the pool, which is a significant liability. Also, the sister's kids aren't well-behaved, which adds to the risk. The sister had previously hosted Christmas for years at her place, but the author isn't comparing the two events. The author even mentions contributing to the event by bringing desserts each year and helping with the work.\n\nThe sister might feel slighted because she's used to hosting and maybe expected the author to accommodate, but the author has a right to set boundaries for their own home. The sister's reaction of calling the author an asshole seems harsh given the author's reasons. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months might indicate the sister is being overly sensitive, but the author's concerns are legitimate.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to prioritize their home's safety and their own comfort. The sister's demand to host the party might be unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
