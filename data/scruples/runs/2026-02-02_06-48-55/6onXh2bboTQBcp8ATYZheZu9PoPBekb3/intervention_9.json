It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house because of the chaos from 14 kids and the liability of the pool.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author bought their dream house and has valid concerns about safety, especially with a pool and many kids. The sister wanted to use the backyard, grill, and pool for the party. The author declined, leading to a conflict and a two-month silence. The sister called her selfish and an asshole, but the author feels it's a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points are: the author's right to privacy and safety, the history of using the sister's house for gatherings, and the practical concerns of hosting 50 people with 14 kids. The sister has hosted Christmas for years, but the author isn't obligated to let others use their home. The author has contributed with desserts, so maybe they've already helped enough.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's decision is about their own home and safety. They aren't required to host events that they feel uncomfortable with. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author has the right to set boundaries. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
