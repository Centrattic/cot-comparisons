It's as chaotic and nightmarish as you can imagine. Usually she never asks to come over to my place because it's a nightmare to travel with 14 kids to come visit their auntie who lives 5 hours away. If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA. So, AITA for not allowing my sister to host my nephew's birthday party at my house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing her sister to host a birthday party at her house.\n\nFirst, the sister has 14 kids, which is a lot. The author bought their dream home and probably doesn't want the chaos of 14 kids plus 50 guests. Safety is a big concern here, especially the pool. The author mentioned the house isn't childproof and the pool could be a liability. That's a valid concern\u2014pool safety is crucial to prevent accidents.\n\nThe sister called the author selfish and an asshole, but the author's reasons seem reasonable. They've always met at the sister's house because it's more convenient for the sister, given the number of kids. The author has contributed to the Christmas gatherings by providing desserts, which shows they've given in the past. Comparing the two events, hosting a birthday for 50 people is different from a Christmas gathering, which might be more structured. \n\nThe sister hasn't visited the author's house with her kids, and the author prefers it that way. It's their home, so they have the right to set boundaries. The fact that they haven't spoken in two months shows the tension, but the author's stance is about safety and personal space. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to safety and personal comfort. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to host a potentially dangerous event. So the answer should be B.\n"
