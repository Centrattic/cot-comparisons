It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling upset that their friend charged them for the pasta ingredients. The friend listed out the Uber rides and the cost of the ingredients, totaling $25 instead of the expected $10. The author paid without objection but is now considering not joining future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the norms around splitting costs when friends share meals. If the friend made pasta at home and invited the author over, is it reasonable to charge for the ingredients? I remember that sometimes when people cook at home for friends, they might split the cost of ingredients, especially if it's a shared meal. However, this can vary based on cultural expectations and the nature of the relationship. If the friend is doing this as a favor, maybe expecting to split costs is normal, but if it's a social event, some might argue that the cost is part of the hospitality.\n\nThe author's initial expectation was around $10, which was probably just for the Uber rides. The friend added $13 for ingredients, which surprised them. The key here is whether the friend should have communicated the expectation of splitting the ingredients cost beforehand. If the friend didn't mention it during the dinner invite, maybe the author wasn't aware they'd be responsible for that. On the other hand, if it's a common practice between them, then the friend might be justified in expecting payment.\n\nAnother angle is the amount. $13 for ingredients could be a significant portion of the total cost. If the pasta was a simple meal, maybe $13 is a bit much. But if it was an elaborate dish with expensive ingredients, that might be different. The context isn't clear on that. Also, the friend might have a policy where they always split such costs, so the author's surprise could stem from not knowing that policy.\n\nThe author's reaction of declining future invitations is a sign of their justified feelings. They might perceive the friend as being more transactional rather than generous. But maybe the friend sees splitting costs as fair and not expecting the author to feel bad. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their feelings and potential future actions.\n\nIn some cases, splitting food costs is standard, so the author might be overreacting if that's the norm. However, charging for ingredients when hosting a friend for dinner might come off as stingy or transactional. The author might not have a problem with splitting the cost of the meal itself, but charging for ingredients could be different. People often expect the host to cover the cost of the meal as part of hospitality, unless they specifically agree beforehand to split the bill.\n\nSo, the friend's approach could be seen as unreasonable if they didn't set the expectation in advance. The author's reaction is about feeling it's weird, which is a common sentiment if the friend didn't communicate the cost division properly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer should be B.\n"
