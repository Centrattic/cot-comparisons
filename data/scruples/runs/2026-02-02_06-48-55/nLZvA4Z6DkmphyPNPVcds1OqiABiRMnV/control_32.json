It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The person was expecting to pay back around $10 for shared Uber rides but ended up paying $25 because the friend added $13 for the pasta ingredients. The person feels it's excessive and plans to decline future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially when they cook, is it expected to split the cost of groceries? I think it's a gray area. Sometimes people might split the cost of shared expenses like transportation, but when it comes to food that one person prepared, it's less clear. The friend might have considered the cost of ingredients as part of their contribution to the meal, expecting the guest to contribute. However, others might see that as being overly transactional, especially if it's a social visit meant to be a kindness or bonding time.\n\nThe person in the story didn't object and paid without argument, but they're now feeling it was a bit much. They're conflicted about whether they're being unreasonable. The key points here are expectations and communication. The friend didn't specify beforehand that they would be charging for ingredients, so the guest didn't expect it. The friend might have thought it was fair to split the cost, but without prior agreement, it can come off as unexpected or even stingy, especially if the amount seems high (like $13 for pasta ingredients, which might be more than necessary or just their markup).\n\nAlso, the person's reaction is to decline future invitations, which might be a bit harsh. However, their feelings are valid if they perceive the situation as unfair. The question is whether the friend was wrong in charging for ingredients, or if the guest is overreacting. In many cases, guests don't split the cost of the food when someone hosts a meal, unless it's a mutual agreement beforehand. So the friend's approach might not be wrong, but the lack of prior communication could be an issue.\n\nBut the person isn't being in the wrong for feeling that way. They had a different expectation, and it's their right to feel that charging for ingredients is excessive. The real problem might be the friend not communicating their intentions beforehand. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
