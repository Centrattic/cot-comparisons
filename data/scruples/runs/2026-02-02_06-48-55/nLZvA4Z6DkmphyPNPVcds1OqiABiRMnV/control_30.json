It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25 back. The breakdown was $7 for an Uber, $5 for another, and $13 for ingredients. The author feels it's weird and plans to decline future dinner invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, are they responsible for paying for the ingredients used in the dinner they attended? Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, the host covers the costs unless it's agreed otherwise. The Uber part makes sense if it was a shared ride, but charging for ingredients might be a bit much. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many places, friends splitting costs for shared expenses like rides is common, but splitting groceries for a meal might be less so. If the friend made it clear beforehand that they expected to split the cost of ingredients, maybe the author should have known. But if it was a surprise, that's probably not fair. \n\nAlso, the amount is $13 for ingredients. How expensive is pasta? Maybe they used high-end ingredients, but usually, pasta isn't that costly. If the friend expected the guest to cover the ingredients, that's a different expectation than just splitting the Uber. The author didn't object but now feels it's justified to not go next time. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend didn't mention the cost of ingredients before the dinner, the author was paying for shared expenses, and the charge for ingredients might be unexpected. The author's reaction is about feeling it's unfair to be charged for the meal they were invited to. \n\nSo, in most social contexts, the host is supposed to handle the cost of the meal. Unless there's a prior agreement to split all expenses, the host typically absorbs the cost. The friend might have been trying to split every expense, which the author isn't comfortable with. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way or declining future invites if that's the case. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
