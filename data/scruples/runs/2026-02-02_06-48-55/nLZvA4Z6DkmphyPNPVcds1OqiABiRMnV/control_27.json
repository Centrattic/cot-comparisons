It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them for dinner, then later charged them for the ingredients used in the pasta. The writer paid without objection but now feels uncomfortable and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs for shared activities. When friends invite each other over for dinner, it's usually understood that the host is covering the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for the cost of ingredients isn't typical unless there's a prior agreement. The host might expect to be reimbursed for shared expenses like Ubers, but food is different. It's part of the hospitality, so adding the cost of ingredients might come off as unexpected and unwelcome.\n\nThe amount in question is $13 for ingredients. That's not a huge sum, but the principle is about etiquette. The writer didn't have prior knowledge of being charged for the food, so the surprise could be why they're upset. Charging for food might make the guest feel like they're paying for the meal, which isn't the usual social norm. However, the writer paid without argument, so their reaction now is about feeling that the friend overcharged or that the act of charging was inconsiderate.\n\nThe friend's approach to listing all expenses, including the pasta ingredients, might be seen as being too meticulous. Friends often split costs informally, and adding up every cent, especially for something like groceries, could strain the friendship. The writer's plan to decline future invites is a strong reaction, but it's based on feeling that the friend's behavior was unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, crossed a social boundary by charging for food without prior discussion. The writer's discomfort is justified because expecting reimbursement for ingredients isn't standard in a friend-hosting scenario. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
