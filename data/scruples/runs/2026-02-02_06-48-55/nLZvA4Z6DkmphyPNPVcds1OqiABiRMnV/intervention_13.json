It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food during a dinner. The friend listed out expenses including Uber rides and ingredients for the pasta. The author paid without objection but now feels conflicted and might decline future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's understood that the host is covering the cost, unless a prior agreement was made otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs, but it's less common unless both parties agreed. The Uber rides are more straightforward because those are shared expenses. However, charging for the pasta ingredients could be where the tension is. \n\nThe author's reaction might stem from not expecting to split the cost of groceries for the meal. If there was no prior discussion about splitting expenses, the host charging for the ingredients might be unexpected. The author didn't object at the time, which could imply they didn't want to cause conflict, but their subsequent decision to decline future invites shows lingering discomfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend didn't communicate the expectation of splitting costs beforehand, the author isn't wrong for being surprised. However, the author didn't clarify the expectations during the dinner, so maybe they should have asked. On the other hand, the friend might have a point if they expected to split shared expenses. \n\nThe main issue is the lack of clear communication. The author might feel it's a breach of social etiquette to charge for the meal, while the friend sees it as fair to split shared costs. Since there's no clear right or wrong without context, but the author's reaction is based on unmet expectations, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. However, if splitting costs wasn't discussed, the friend might be overstepping. But the author's decision to pay without protest might make them complicit in the situation, even if they're upset later. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the friend didn't clarify expectations beforehand. The author's discomfort is valid if there was no prior agreement to split costs for the meal's ingredients. The friend's approach could be seen as unexpected and potentially unfair, leading the author to feel justified in their reaction.\n"
