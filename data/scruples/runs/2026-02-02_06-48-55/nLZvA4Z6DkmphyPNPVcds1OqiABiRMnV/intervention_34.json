It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling upset that their friend charged them for pasta they made. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, then later charged them for ingredients and Ubers. The author paid without complaint but now is considering not accepting future invites because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. When someone invites you for dinner, it's typically seen as a gesture of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unusual because the host usually covers the cost as part of the social event. However, if there's an agreement beforehand to split costs, maybe it's different. But in this case, there's no mention of prior agreement, so it might be unexpected.\n\nThe friend listed the charges as $7 for one Uber, $5 for another, and $13 for ingredients. The author expected around $10, but the total came to $25. The $13 for ingredients seems like a significant jump. Depending on the region and the type of pasta, the cost might be higher, but generally, ingredients for a basic pasta dish shouldn't be that expensive. Maybe the friend bought premium ingredients or there were multiple people? Not sure. But the author might feel it's excessive without prior discussion.\n\nThe author didn't object but now feels it's justified to decline future invites. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend charged for food and Ubers, which might be seen as splitting costs fairly, but the author didn't like it. \n\nSocially, it's common to split shared expenses like Ubers if agreed upon. But charging for the meal itself might not be typical unless it's a potluck or there's a specific agreement. The author might feel the friend is treating the meal as a service, which can be uncomfortable. The friend might not have realized that the ingredients cost more than the author expected. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling charged for something they thought was a friendly gesture. Declining future invites is a personal choice, but the author might be overreacting if the friend had a legitimate reason for the charges. However, if the friend didn't ask the author to contribute beforehand and just listed the charges later, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the friend might be at fault for not discussing the costs beforehand, while the author is justified in feeling upset. However, the author's decision to not attend future dinners might be a bit harsh if the friend had no prior indication that this would be an issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They felt charged for something that was supposed to be a friendly dinner, and the amount charged might have been unexpected. The friend might have overstepped by not discussing the costs upfront. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
