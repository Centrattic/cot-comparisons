It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend invited them over for pasta, which the author enjoyed. Then, when they met up later, the friend asked for $25. The author expected around $10, but the friend broke it down into Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author paid without a fight but feels uncomfortable and plans to decline future invites. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether it's reasonable to charge a friend for dinner. In many cultures, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's typically seen as a gesture of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for the ingredients might be unexpected. However, if the Uber rides were shared, splitting the cost is common. The author is upset because the friend charged for both the rides and the meal, which they find odd. \n\nThe author didn't object but feels justified in their feelings. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the friend expected to be reimbursed for all expenses, maybe they should have clarified earlier. However, the author might have assumed that the dinner was a social event without expecting payment. The friend's approach could be seen as a misunderstanding of social norms. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was part of an agreement to split all shared expenses, including the meal, then maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author might have thought only the Uber was to be split. But the friend's inclusion of the pasta ingredients as a charge might be the main issue here. \n\nSo, considering social norms, charging for the meal might not be expected unless it was a business arrangement. The author's reaction could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong for charging for the meal, making the author not at fault. Hence, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
