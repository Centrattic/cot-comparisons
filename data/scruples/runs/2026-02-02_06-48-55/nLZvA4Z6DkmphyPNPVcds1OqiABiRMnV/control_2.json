It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend made pasta dinner, invited the author over, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid but is now considering not accepting future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the social norms here. When friends get together, splitting costs can be a sensitive topic. If someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually expected that they cover the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as transactional, which could feel odd if not discussed beforehand.\n\nThe friend listed out expenses including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part is more understandable if they were shared and split. But the ingredients for the meal? That depends on the relationship and prior agreement. If the author didn't discuss splitting the cost before the dinner, the friend's action might come off as unexpected. The author's reaction is about feeling charged for a social activity that was supposed to be friendly, not a business transaction.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time but now feels it's justified to distance themselves. The key points here are communication and expectations. If the friend assumed the author would split the meal cost without discussing it, that's a miscommunication. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that the friend overcharged or made the interaction awkward. Declining future invitations is a personal choice to avoid discomfort, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's approach lacked prior communication and might have crossed social boundaries of hospitality.\n"
