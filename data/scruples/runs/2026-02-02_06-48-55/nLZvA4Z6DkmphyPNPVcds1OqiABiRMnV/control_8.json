It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25 back, including $13 for ingredients. The author paid without protest but now feels it's unfair and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a friendly gesture, and guests don't expect to be charged. The friend might have a different view, expecting the guest to cover their share of expenses, especially if they split Uber rides before. But charging for the ingredients could be seen as a bit much since the meal is a gift in that context.\n\nThe author didn't object, which shows they might not want to cause conflict, but their feelings are valid. Charging for food in a social setting can be seen as crossing a boundary. The key points are the expectation of the meal being a social event, not a transactional one. The Uber part is more split, as shared rides are often split, but ingredients are part of the meal, which is usually the host's expense. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. They handled it politely by paying but their hesitation to attend again is understandable. The friend might be overstepping by itemizing and charging for ingredients. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
