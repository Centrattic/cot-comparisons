It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong for finding it weird that a friend charged them for food. \n\nFirst, when a friend invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture rather than a business transaction. The expectation is that the host is covering the meal as part of the invitation. If the host then charges the guest for the ingredients, that might come off as unexpected or even a bit transactional.\n\nThe friend listed specific amounts, including the cost of ingredients. While splitting Uber rides is common, charging for groceries used in cooking might not be something people expect. The author felt it was a lot, especially since the initial estimate was around $10 but turned out to be $25. \n\nThe author paid without objection but plans to decline future invitations, which shows they felt uncomfortable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nIn social contexts, splitting costs is usually discussed beforehand. If the friend expected reimbursement for groceries, maybe they should have mentioned it before the dinner. Charging after the fact without prior agreement might be seen as unreasonable. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the ingredients since it wasn't part of the initial understanding. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions might have caused the misunderstanding.\n"
