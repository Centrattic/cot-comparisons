It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought it was weird and is now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you to dinner at their home, it's usually considered a favor, and they're doing you a courtesy. Charging for the food might be seen as unusual because the host typically covers the cost as part of the hospitality. However, if there were shared expenses like Uber rides, splitting those makes sense. \n\nThe friend added the cost of the pasta ingredients to the total. The author was expecting around $10 for the Uber rides but ended up being charged $25, which included the $13 for ingredients. The author paid without arguments but feels it's unfair. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend expected reimbursement for the ingredients, maybe that wasn't clear beforehand. The author might not have known that they'd be split the cost of groceries for the meal. Charging for ingredients could be seen as unexpected, especially if the meal was a social event rather than a business arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had a prior agreement about splitting all expenses, then maybe the friend isn't wrong. But since it's a personal dinner, the expectation is usually that the host covers the cost. So the friend charging for ingredients might be going beyond what's customary. \n\nThe author's reaction seems justified. They felt the charge was unexpected and excessive. Declining future invitations isn't necessarily the right move, but their feelings are valid. The friend might have been too direct in billing them for the meal, which can feel impersonal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for finding this strange. The friend might have handled it differently. Answer B.\n"
