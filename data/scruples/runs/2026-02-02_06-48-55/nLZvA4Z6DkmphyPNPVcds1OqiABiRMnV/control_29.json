It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's friend invited them over for dinner and made pasta. They had a good time. Later, when they met up again, the friend asked for money back for shared Uber rides and the ingredients for the pasta. The author expected around $10 but was told $25. The friend broke it down into $7, $5 for Ubers, and $13 for ingredients. The author paid without arguing but is now considering not accepting future dinner invitations because they think charging for the food is weird and maybe overcharged.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. When someone invites you over for dinner, is it expected that you pay for the food? In some cultures, it's common to split the cost, but in others, the host covers it as a gesture of hospitality. The author might be upset because they didn't expect to pay for the ingredients. The friend, on the other hand, might have considered it a shared expense, especially since they also had shared Uber rides.\n\nThe friend itemized the charges, which shows transparency. The $13 for ingredients might seem high, but if the friend actually spent that much, maybe it's fair. The author didn't ask about the amount beforehand, so they might have assumed the host would cover it. However, splitting costs for shared expenses like rides is reasonable. The issue is whether charging for the meal itself is appropriate.\n\nThere's a difference between splitting a bill at a restaurant and reimbursing for home-cooked meals. Some people might see it as fair to contribute if it's a regular thing, but if it's a one-time thing, the host might just cover it. The author's reaction could be justified if they felt it was unexpected. However, the friend might have felt it's only fair to split the costs, especially if they're friends who share expenses regularly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend asked for reimbursement for the ingredients, maybe that's not typical, but it's not necessarily wrong. The author didn't specify if they were aware of the cost before the dinner. If they were surprised, that's a valid feeling. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the ingredients, but the author's response of declining future invites could be seen as a bit harsh if the friend was just trying to be fair. However, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
