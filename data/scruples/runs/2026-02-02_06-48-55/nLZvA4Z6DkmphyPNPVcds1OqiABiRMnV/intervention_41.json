It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food and Uber rides. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them $13 for ingredients and the Ubers. The author didn't expect to be charged for the dinner part and now is considering not attending future dinners.\n\nSo, the key points here. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a transactional one. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as unexpected unless there was prior agreement. The author paid without objection but is now feeling uncomfortable.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author's issue isn't just the amount but the fact that they were charged at all for the dinner. Charging for ingredients could be controversial because cooking a meal for a friend is typically a hospitality expense, not something to be reimbursed unless agreed upon beforehand. The Uber charges might be more straightforward if they were shared rides, but adding the ingredients on top complicates things.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Or is the friend being unreasonable by charging for the meal? The friend might have expected reimbursement for the Ubers, which is common when splitting costs for shared expenses. However, charging for ingredients is probably where the line is crossed. The author's reaction isn't about the Uber charges but the meal. Declining future invites could be a result of feeling that the friend is treating social interactions as financial transactions.\n\nSo, considering social norms, charging for a meal you're hosting is unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The author's discomfort is justified. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong, making the author not in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be B.\n"
