It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the person over for dinner, which is a common courtesy. The person enjoyed the evening and didn't object when the friend listed the charges later. The main issue is that the friend charged $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author feels it's a lot and plans to decline future invites.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner, they don't expect guests to pay for the food unless it's a business arrangement or a specific agreement beforehand. Charging for ingredients might be seen as charging for the cost of the meal, which isn't usual in casual settings. However, if they had an understanding that expenses would be split, maybe the friend is just following through.\n\nThe author didn't object in the moment, which could imply they might have agreed to it, even if they felt it was high. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the ingredients. If there was no prior agreement, the friend might have overstepped. The author's reaction is understandable if they feel it's an unexpected charge for a social event.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if they shared Uber rides and split those costs, it's fair to split the cost of the meal as well. But charging for ingredients is different from paying for a restaurant meal. In a home setting, it's unusual unless it's a potluck where everyone brings something. The author's discomfort could be valid because the friend didn't clarify the cost beforehand.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend charged without prior discussion, maybe the friend is at fault. The author's hesitation to attend again is a reaction to feeling it's unfair. However, the author didn't question the amount immediately, which might be seen as passive-aggressive now. But the core issue is the friend's action of charging for the meal ingredients without prior agreement. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. Social norms generally don't include charging friends for home-cooked meals unless agreed upon. The friend might be the one overstepping. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
