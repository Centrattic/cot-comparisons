It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objecting but now feels it was too much and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When friends have dinner, it's common to split the bill or one person offers to pay and the other reciprocates later. But charging for ingredients might be less common. The friend listed out Uber fares, which are straightforward, but the pasta ingredients add a twist. \n\nThe key points here are whether charging for ingredients is acceptable. Some might argue that if the friend made the meal for the guest, it's part of the social gesture to not charge, similar to hosting. Others might say if they're splitting costs for shared expenses, including ingredients is fair. The amount is also a factor\u2014$13 for ingredients could be seen as reasonable or not depending on the item and the relationship.\n\nThe author paid without complaint, which shows they didn't object at the time. But their reaction now is feeling justified in declining future invites. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nIf the friend's action is within social norms, then the author's reaction might be overreacting. But if charging for ingredients isn't typical, then the author's feelings are justified. Also, the Uber expenses were split, which is common, but the food cost is less standard. \n\nI think the author's reaction is understandable. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected in a friendly dinner setting. The friend might have been trying to split costs, but it could come off as transactional rather than a kind gesture. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable with that. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
