It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend charged them for ingredients used in a dinner. The writer paid but feels uncomfortable and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's generally understood that the host covers the cost. Charging guests for ingredients isn't typical unless there's a prior agreement. The friend here listed out the costs, including Ubers and ingredients. The writer was expecting around $10 but was asked for $25, which they found high. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the friend communicate the cost upfront? If the host didn't mention it beforehand, that's a problem. Also, the writer didn't object and paid to avoid being petty, which might suggest they felt pressured. The writer's feelings of being uncomfortable are valid. Socially, splitting costs for shared activities like Ubers is common, but charging for ingredients in a dinner invite is unusual. \n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate if they didn't clarify the expectations beforehand. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They're within their rights to reassess future invitations. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
