It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking it's weird a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The person expected to pay back around $10 for Uber rides but ended up having to pay $25 because the friend added the cost of the pasta ingredients.\n\nHmm. So first, when someone invites you over for dinner, especially a friend, it's usually understood that the host is covering the cost. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be unexpected. The person didn't object at the time but now feels it's a bit much. They might be wondering if their reaction is justified.\n\nThe key points here are expectations. In many social norms, when you invite someone to your home for a meal, the host is expected to provide the food and drinks as part of the invitation. Charging the guest for the cost of the ingredients isn't typical unless there's a prior agreement. The friend might have thought that splitting costs is fair, but the guest felt it was unexpected and possibly excessive.\n\nThe author's dilemma is whether their reaction is justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. Choosing between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf the friend didn't mention the cost beforehand, it's possible the guest wasn't expecting to pay for the food. The act of charging for ingredients after the fact could be seen as not transparent. However, the guest didn't object immediately, so maybe they should have communicated their discomfort then. But maybe the host should have discussed the cost beforehand. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's usually the host's choice to cover the meal. If the host wants to split costs, that should be discussed in advance. Charging for ingredients without prior discussion might be seen as inconsiderate. The guest's reaction of declining the next invitation is a response to feeling charged for something they didn't expect. \n\nSo, if the friend didn't set the expectation beforehand, the guest isn't in the wrong for being upset. The friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
