It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the friend invited them over for dinner. The friend made pasta, and the evening was nice. Later, when meeting again, the friend asked for money back. The user expected around $10 for shared Ubers but was asked $25, which included $13 for ingredients.\n\nThe user paid without objection but feels it's a bit much and plans to decline future invitations. They're wondering if they're in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's about expectations and social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a gesture of hospitality, and charging for the food isn't standard unless there's an agreement beforehand. The user didn't expect to pay for ingredients, which might be why they feel charged. The friend charged for ingredients, which could be seen as expecting reimbursement, but maybe not all of it. The user's reaction is about feeling it's a lot, not just the charging itself.\n\nIn many social circles, splitting costs for shared expenses like Ubers is common, but charging for groceries used in a dinner might not be. The user might feel it's a form of keeping track, but if it's not discussed upfront, it can lead to discomfort. The user isn't at fault for feeling that way because it's not a typical expectation. The friend might have different views on shared costs, but the user's feelings are valid based on social norms.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're justified in feeling charged for something that's usually a social courtesy.\n"
