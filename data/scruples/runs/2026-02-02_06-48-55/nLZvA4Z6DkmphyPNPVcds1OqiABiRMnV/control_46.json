It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that a friend charged them for dinner.\n\nThe situation: The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The AITA part is about whether they're wrong for feeling it's weird to be charged for the meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's understood that the host covers the cost. Charging a guest for ingredients might be unexpected unless there was prior agreement. The friend added 13 dollars for ingredients, which the AITA found excessive. The person paid up but plans to decline future invites, feeling justified or maybe overreacting.\n\nIs the AITA in the wrong? Well, the host might think they're being fair, but guests usually don't expect to pay unless it's a potluck or shared expense. The key here is whether the guest was informed beforehand. If the friend didn't mention splitting the cost, it's reasonable for the guest to feel it's odd. Charging for ingredients without prior discussion could be seen as unreasonable. The amount might also be a factor\u201413 for ingredients seems high depending on the meal, but without specifics, it's hard to say. However, the main issue is the expectation of the host covering their own costs. The AITA isn't in the wrong for being upset because the friend didn't set clear expectations. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
