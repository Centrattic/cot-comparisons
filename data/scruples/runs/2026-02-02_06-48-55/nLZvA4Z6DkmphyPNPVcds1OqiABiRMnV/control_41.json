It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients and Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25 back. The breakdown was two Uber rides totaling $12 and $13 for ingredients. The author felt it was too much, especially for dinner, and plans to decline future invites.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether charging for ingredients is reasonable. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless agreed otherwise. Charging for the ingredients might come off as unexpected and could be seen as keeping track of expenses in a way that's not typical for friends. The Uber part is more straightforward if they shared rides and split the cost, but combining that with the dinner cost complicates things.\n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but felt it was wrong. The question is if they're in the wrong. From a social norm perspective, expecting to be reimbursed for food when you're the guest might not be the norm. However, if the Uber was a shared expense, that's more common. The friend might have been trying to be fair, but the way it was presented could be seen as transactional rather than a friendly gesture.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on common expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling it's weird to be charged for dinner. Friends usually don't split every expense unless there's an agreement beforehand. The friend might have set an expectation that wasn't clear. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
