It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author expected to pay back around $10 for shared Uber rides but ended up paying $25 because the friend added $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author didn't argue but feels justified in declining future dinners because of this.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's reasonable to charge a friend for the cost of a meal they invited you to. In many social contexts, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary for the host to cover the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be seen as inconsiderate or stingy, especially if the guest wasn't aware this would happen. The author might feel that the friend didn't account for the social norm where the host's expense is part of the invitation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that splitting costs is fair, especially if they consider the guest's presence as sharing the expense. However, in some cultures or friendships, splitting the cost of a meal isn't expected unless it's a mutually agreed-upon arrangement. The friend's approach of listing out every expense, including ingredients, might come off as overly meticulous and could disrupt the social expectation of the host covering the meal.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as a reasonable response to a situation where the social norms were not met. Declining future invitations is a personal choice, but the feeling of being charged for something that was supposed to be a shared, friendly activity is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way because the friend's actions deviated from typical social etiquette. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
