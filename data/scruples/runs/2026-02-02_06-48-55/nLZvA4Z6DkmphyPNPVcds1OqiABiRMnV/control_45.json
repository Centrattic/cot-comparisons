It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was invited over for dinner by a friend who made pasta. After a few days, when the friend asked for money back, the author expected around $10 but was asked for $25. The breakdown included Uber rides and the cost of ingredients for the pasta. The author paid without objections but feels uncomfortable and might decline future invites.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend charged for the food's ingredients, which is unusual in many social contexts. 2) The charge was significantly higher than expected. 3) The author is considering not attending future dinners because of this.\n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone invites you for dinner, it's typically seen as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be considered odd in many cultures, where splitting costs for shared expenses (like splits for rideshares) is common, but expecting reimbursement for the cost of the meal itself isn't. However, this can vary based on personal agreements or cultural expectations. If the friend and the author had a prior understanding where they split all costs, then maybe the friend is within their right. But the scenario doesn't mention such an agreement.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on feeling that charging for ingredients is unreasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf the author didn't agree to split the cost of the meal beforehand, then the friend might be overstepping. The friend's action could be seen as turning a social gesture into a transactional one, which the author found uncomfortable. The author's decision to pay without objection might be to avoid conflict, but their feeling of being wronged is valid because the friend's behavior didn't align with their expectations of what a dinner invitation implies.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer should be B (No).\n"
