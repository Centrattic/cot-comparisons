It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend made pasta dinner, invited the author over, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid up but now feels uncomfortable and might not accept future dinner invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social norms here. Typically, when friends invite each other for meals, especially casual ones, it's usually not expected that the guest pays for the ingredients. The host covers the cost as a gesture of hospitality. However, if the meal is part of a shared expense or if there's a prior agreement, maybe splitting costs makes sense. But in this case, the friend listed the ingredients as a separate charge, which seems odd.\n\nThe author gave the money without objections but feels it's a lot. The key points here are whether charging for ingredients in a casual dinner is normal and if the author's reaction is justified. The friend might have considered it a shared expense, but that's not the usual practice. The author's discomfort is valid because expecting payment for a meal you've invited someone over for can come off as transactional rather than friendly.\n\nSo, the author's feelings are justified. Charging for food in such a context is not typical, and the friend's approach might have been inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Their decision to decline future invitations is a personal choice, but the root of the issue is the friend's action, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
