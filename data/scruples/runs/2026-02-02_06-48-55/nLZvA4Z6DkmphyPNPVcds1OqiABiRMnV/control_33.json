It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for the pasta dinner.\n\nFirst, the friend invited them over for dinner. The user expected it to be a friendly gesture, not something they'd have to pay for. The friend then charged them for the ingredients, which seems a bit odd. Normally, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a gesture of hospitality, not an invoice. Charging for ingredients might be seen as expecting reimbursement for the cost, which isn't typical unless they discussed it beforehand.\n\nThe user paid without objections but now feels resentful and plans to decline future invites. They're wondering if they're in the wrong for feeling that way. The key points here are expectations and communication. The friend didn't mention beforehand that there would be a charge for the ingredients, which led to confusion. The user might feel that splitting Uber costs is normal, but charging for groceries is different. \n\nFrom a social norms perspective, hosting a meal usually doesn't involve the guest paying for ingredients unless it's a specific arrangement. The friend's approach might have been abrupt, making the user feel like they're being nickel-and-dimed. However, the user also didn't ask about the charges until after the fact, so maybe they could have clarified earlier. But since the friend didn't mention it beforehand, the user's reaction seems valid. \n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for feeling it's odd. The friend might have handled it better by discussing the reimbursement before the meal. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
