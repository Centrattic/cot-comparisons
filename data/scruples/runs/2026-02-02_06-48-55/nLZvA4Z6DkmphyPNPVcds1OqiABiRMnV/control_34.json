It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So, the situation is that the friend made pasta dinner and later asked for money back for ingredients, Ubers, etc. The author paid but feels it's a bit much and might not go again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when friends invite you over for dinner, it's considered a friendly gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be seen as expecting reimbursement for your own cost, which is different from splitting shared expenses like Uber. But splitting Uber rides is common, so that part is okay. The ingredients part is the issue here.\n\nThe friend listed out the amounts: $7, $5 Uber and $13 for ingredients. The total was $25, which was higher than the author expected. The author paid without objection but felt it was a lot. The key points here are whether it's reasonable to charge for the meal and if the amount is fair.\n\nIn many cultures, expecting repayment for the cost of a meal can be seen as putting a price on friendship. Friends often cover expenses for shared experiences, but when it's a meal you prepared for someone, it's different. The ingredients cost might be the friend's personal expense, so expecting reimbursement could be seen as not considering the meal a gesture of friendship. However, if they had agreed beforehand to split costs, maybe it's okay. But the author didn't mention that. The friend didn't ask if they wanted to split the ingredients cost beforehand, which could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the amount. $13 for ingredients for pasta might seem high. How much does pasta actually cost? If it's a simple dish, maybe the friend overcharged. Or maybe they used expensive ingredients. Without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say. But the author might feel that the friend is treating them as an equal cost-splitter rather than a guest.\n\nThe author's reaction is to decline future invites. Is that fair? If the friend is charging for meals each time, the author is within their right to avoid that. The question is whether the friend's action was wrong. If the friend is charging for ingredients without prior agreement, that could be seen as the friend's mistake. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
