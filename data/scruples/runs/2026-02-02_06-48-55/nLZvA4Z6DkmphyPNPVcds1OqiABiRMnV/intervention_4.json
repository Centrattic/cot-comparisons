It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for feeling it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought the amount owed was around $10 but it was $25, including $13 for the ingredients. The author paid without objection but is now considering not attending future dinners. They're conflicted: part of them feels justified, but maybe they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nIn many friendships, splitting costs like Uber rides is common, especially if they're shared. But charging for the ingredients used in a homemade meal can be more subjective. Some people might consider it a cost that the host should bear, while others might think it's fair to split if the guest is contributing. The key here is whether the friend expected the author to pay for the ingredients and if that expectation was communicated. \n\nIf the friend didn't mention the cost of ingredients beforehand, the author might have a valid point. Friends often cover the cost of meals when hosting, but if the friend made it a rule to split everything, then maybe the author should have known. However, the act of inviting someone over for dinner is usually seen as a gesture of hospitality, so expecting payment for ingredients might come off as transactional rather than friendly. \n\nThe author's reaction isn't about not paying but about the unexpected charge for the meal. Declining future invitations is their way of setting a boundary, which is reasonable if they feel the friend is being too transactional. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, in some places, splitting exact costs is expected, while in others, the host covers the meal. Without prior agreement, the friend might be wrong to expect payment for the ingredients. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable. It depends on the norms of their friendship. If they usually split everything, it's okay. If not, the friend might have overstepped. Since the author paid without objection, maybe they're not in the wrong here. They might be learning the friend's expectations, but the next step of declining future dinners is a personal choice to avoid being taken advantage of. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
