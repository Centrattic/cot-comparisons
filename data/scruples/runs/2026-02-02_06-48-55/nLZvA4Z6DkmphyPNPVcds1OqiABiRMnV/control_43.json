It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objections but is now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when you're invited over for dinner, it's implied that the host is covering the costs, and the guest isn't expected to pay. However, the friend here added the cost of ingredients to what the author owed for Uber rides. That seems a bit odd because food costs are typically part of the host's responsibility unless agreed otherwise. The friend might have felt that since they shared Uber rides before, splitting costs is fair, but adding the pasta ingredients on top might be unexpected.\n\nThe author's reaction is confusion and feeling that it's a lot. They paid without objections, which shows they're not being confrontational, but their plan to decline future invites suggests they feel disrespected. The question is whether the friend was wrong for charging for the pasta. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, unless the guest offered to pay for the food beforehand, the host usually covers that. The friend might have thought splitting all shared expenses was fair, but the author didn't expect food costs. The key here is whether there was a prior agreement. If not, the friend's action could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's action might not be right, but the author's response is understandable. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
