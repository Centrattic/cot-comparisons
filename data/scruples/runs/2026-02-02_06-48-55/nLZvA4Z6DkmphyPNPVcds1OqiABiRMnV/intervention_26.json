It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The friend also added up other shared expenses like Uber rides. The author paid without objection but is now considering not attending future dinners. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's typically considered a courtesy, not a service to be paid for. Charging for the ingredients might be unexpected because the host usually covers the cost as part of the invitation. However, if the friend mentioned splitting the Uber rides beforehand, that's more straightforward. The Uber charges were probably agreed upon, but the ingredients being split might be where the issue lies.\n\nThe author is confused because they expected around $10 but got $25. The friend charged $13 for ingredients. Was that a reasonable split? If the pasta ingredients were bought specifically for the meal, splitting the cost is one thing, but if the friend is charging for their usual grocery expenses, that's different. Also, the author might feel it's odd because the invitation was meant to be a friendly gesture, not a business transaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might be trying to be fair by splitting all shared expenses, even the food. The author didn't object at the time, which could imply they agreed, but now they're regretful. The author's reaction of declining future invitations is a consequence, but is that justified? \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend expected to split all costs, maybe they should have discussed it upfront. The author didn't ask about splitting the food cost, so maybe the friend overstepped. However, the author also didn't clarify the payment terms before accepting. \n\nSo, the key points are: charging for food prepared for a social dinner is unusual, the total amount seemed high, and the author felt it was intrusive. The friend's approach might have been inconsiderate, but the author could have addressed it at the time. However, since the author paid without objection, maybe they have to live with it. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the friend's action of charging for food in a social context is what's unusual. The author's discomfort is justified, and their decision to decline future invites is a reasonable boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
