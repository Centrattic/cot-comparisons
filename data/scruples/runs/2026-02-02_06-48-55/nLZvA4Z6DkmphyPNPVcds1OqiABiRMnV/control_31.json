It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited them over, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author paid but feels it was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the norms around splitting costs with friends. Usually, when someone invites you for dinner, they might expect to cover their own costs unless there's an agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients could be seen as splitting the cost, especially if they used shared resources. But how common is that?\n\nThe author mentions they owed money for Uber rides, which they probably split. But the friend added the pasta ingredients to that. So maybe the friend considered it as part of shared expenses. However, charging for ingredients might not be standard practice. People usually cover their own costs unless it's agreed upfront. \n\nAlso, the amount seems high. 13 dollars for ingredients for two people? That might be a bit much. Maybe the friend thought they should split the cost of the meal, but the author didn't expect that. The key here is communication. If the friend didn't mention beforehand that they'd be charged for the meal, it's fair for the author to feel surprised. \n\nThe author paid without objections but plans to decline future invites. They're not in the wrong for feeling this way. The friend might have overstepped by not discussing the payment beforehand. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
