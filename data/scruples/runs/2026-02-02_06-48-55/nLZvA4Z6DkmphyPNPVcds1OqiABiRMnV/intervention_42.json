It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other shared expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25. The person expected around $10, which was for Uber rides. The friend added the cost of ingredients ($13) to the total. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate to charge a friend for ingredients used in making dinner.\n\nI remember that when friends get together, sometimes splitting costs is expected, especially if one person covers expenses upfront. But usually, people don't charge for shared meals unless there's an agreement beforehand. Maybe the friend expected reimbursement for the ingredients, but maybe the author didn't know that was going to happen. \n\nThe author didn't object and paid the money, but now they're feeling conflicted. Declining the next dinner invite is their response. The key points here are communication and expectations. If the friend didn't mention the cost of ingredients before the dinner, maybe that's where the misunderstanding happened. However, if the friend is covering the cost and then expects to be reimbursed, that's fair in some contexts, but maybe not in casual friendships where splitting costs isn't discussed in advance.\n\nAlso, charging $13 for pasta ingredients might be a bit much. Pasta is generally not that expensive. Maybe the friend overestimated or was being precise, but if the cost is split between two people, $13 per person seems high. That could contribute to the author's feeling of being charged too much.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't agree to pay for the ingredients beforehand. If the friend expected reimbursement, they should have mentioned it at the time. The author might have assumed it was a friendly dinner without needing to pay. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset about it. However, they did pay without arguing, which shows they're considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is covering their own costs and the author agreed to split expenses, but the author didn't clarify the extent, maybe they should have asked. But since the friend listed the charges after the fact, it's more the friend's fault for not communicating upfront. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to be confused and feel the charges were excessive since there was no prior agreement. So the answer should be B.\n"
