It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for finding it weird that their friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients plus other expenses like Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if charging for ingredients is reasonable. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a friendly gesture, not a business transaction. So charging for the cost of ingredients might be unexpected. The person who wrote the story is confused because they thought it was a casual dinner, not something they'd have to pay for.\n\nThe friend listed out specific amounts for Uber rides and the ingredients. The total ended up being higher than expected. The author paid without objections but now feels they might be overreacting. The key points here are expectations and communication. If the friend had said beforehand that they'd be splitting the cost of ingredients, maybe it wouldn't be an issue. But since it wasn't discussed, the friend's action of charging for ingredients might come off as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients might be a point of contention. If the pasta was a simple meal, $13 for ingredients seems high. Maybe the friend overestimated the cost or included things that weren't necessary. The author's reaction is about feeling that the charge was excessive and unexpected.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to split costs for shared expenses like Uber rides. But charging for a meal that was supposed to be a favor or a friendly dinner is less clear. The author isn't wrong to feel that this was unexpected. The friend might have had good intentions but missed the mark on communication.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction is justified. They weren't in the wrong for being upset. The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't at fault here.\n"
