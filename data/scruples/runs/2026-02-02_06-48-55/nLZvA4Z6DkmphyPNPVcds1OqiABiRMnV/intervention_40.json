It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients and Uber rides. The author is confused because they expected a smaller amount and now feel it's too much. They plan to decline the next dinner invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, splitting the cost is common, but splitting every single expense like ingredients might be unusual. Charging for ingredients could be seen as itemizing costs which might not be expected unless\u4e8b\u5148 agreed. \n\nThe Uber rides are clear\u2014they shared rides, so splitting the cost makes sense. But the pasta ingredients... if the friend made the pasta solely for the author, maybe splitting is fair. But if it's a regular thing or just a meal with friends, charging for ingredients might not be typical. The author feels it's too much, charging $13 for ingredients. Maybe the friend overestimated the cost or expected a contribution for the effort. \n\nThe author gave the money without objections to avoid conflict but now feels resentful. That's a problem because it might lead to future issues. The key is whether the friend's request was reasonable. If the friend expected a split of actual costs (like shared Uber) and some contribution for groceries, maybe that's acceptable. But if the author wasn't prepared for that, it's a miscommunication. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend itemized all shared expenses, maybe the author should have known. But expecting to pay for ingredients unless agreed upon is pushing. So maybe the author isn't wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have asked or discussed splitting costs upfront. \n\nHmm. The friend might have thought it's fair to split all shared costs, but the author didn't expect that. The author's response (declining next time) is understandable because they feel taken. But maybe they should have communicated their expectations earlier. However, the friend's approach might be seen as unreasonable. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
