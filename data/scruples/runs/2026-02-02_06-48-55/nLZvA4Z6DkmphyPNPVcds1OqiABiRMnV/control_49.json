It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shared this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The person paid without argument but is now considering not accepting future invitations. They're wondering if their reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the social norms here. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the food might be seen as unexpected or impolite unless there was a prior agreement. The friend listed out the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part makes sense if they shared rides and split costs, but charging for the pasta ingredients is the main point of contention.\n\nThe user paid the money but feels it's wrong. They're second-guessing their reaction. The key points are: 1) Charging for a home-cooked meal without prior discussion. 2) The amount charged (13$ for ingredients might be excessive if the meal was a friendly gesture). 3) The user's decision to decline future invitations, which is their right.\n\nSocially, when you host someone, it's usually your responsibility to cover the costs. Unless there's an explicit agreement to split costs, expecting payment for food could be seen as inappropriate. The friend might have felt it's fair to split Uber costs, but extending that to the meal ingredients is questionable.\n\nThe user's reaction of feeling weird and planning to decline future invites is understandable. They might be overreacting in terms of the long-term friendship, but their feelings are valid. The question is about whether the user is at fault. Since there's no indication the user was supposed to pay for the meal, the friend might have overstepped. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. So the answer should be B.\n"
