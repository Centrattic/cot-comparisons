It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset that their friend charged them for food during a dinner. The author invited the friend over, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The friend paid back the Uber rides, which they didn't mind, but the pasta charge felt high. The user wonders if they're in the wrong for declining future invitations.\n\nHmm. First, when someone invites someone over for dinner, it's usually a social gesture, not an expectation of reimbursement. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as unexpected. The author might feel that expecting payment for food is odd in a friendship. But maybe the friend thought it was fair since they split other expenses like Uber. \n\nThe amount charged was $13 for ingredients. Depending on the cost of pasta ingredients, maybe that's reasonable. If it was just pasta, tomatoes, and some cheese, maybe that's not too much. But if it was more elaborate, perhaps the cost is higher. However, in many social situations, people don't expect guests to pay for food unless it's a potluck or some sort of agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nThe author didn't object when paying but feels uncomfortable now. They plan to decline future invitations, which might come off as a bit harsh. The friend might have different expectations about splitting costs. The key here is social norms. Typically, when someone hosts, they cover the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest might be seen as transactional, which could strain the friendship.\n\nBut maybe the friend had a different perspective, thinking that since they shared other expenses (Uber rides), splitting the food cost was fair. However, it's not standard practice to split food costs unless both parties agree beforehand. The author's reaction is about the principle of being charged for something that was meant to be a kind gesture.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they feel that expecting payment for a hosted dinner is odd, they're not wrong. But if their response is to cut off the friendship, that's a different matter. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their feelings. The answer likely is B (No), because the author's feelings are valid given standard social norms. Charging for food when you're the host isn't typical, so the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way.\n"
