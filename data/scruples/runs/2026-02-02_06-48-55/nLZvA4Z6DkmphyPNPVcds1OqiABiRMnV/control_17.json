It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The scenario is about a friend charging them for a dinner. The friend made pasta and later asked for $13 for the ingredients. The person felt it was too much and now is considering avoiding future dinners with them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The friend invited the person over for dinner, which is typically seen as a social gesture. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting the cost, but the person is uncomfortable with it. The key points here are expectations and norms around social gatherings.\n\nIn many cultures, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's usually their way of being hospitable, not an invoice. Charging for ingredients, especially when the meal was a friendly gesture, can come off as transactional rather than social. The $13 might seem reasonable if it's about covering costs, but the context matters. The person didn't object at the time but is now feeling justified in their reaction.\n\nThe friend's approach might have been a bit off because it could be expected that the person would have offered to contribute to the meal's cost. However, the way the friend listed all the expenses later might have turned a friendly gesture into something transactional. The author's reaction\u2014to avoid future dinners\u2014is a personal choice, but their feelings are valid given the unexpected charges.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions might not be malicious, but they could have been more considerate. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way. They handled it maturely by paying without objections but are now distancing themselves, which is their right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
