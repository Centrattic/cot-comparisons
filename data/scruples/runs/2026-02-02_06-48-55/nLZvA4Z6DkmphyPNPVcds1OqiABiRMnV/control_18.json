It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend cooked pasta and then later asked for money back, not just for shared Uber rides but also for the ingredients. The author paid without a fight but is now considering not accepting future dinner invitations. They're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social norms here. When friends invite someone over for dinner, especially when they cook, it's usually considered a gesture of friendship. Charging for the meal might be seen as transactional, which could feel odd in a casual friendship setting. The author's confusion and discomfort is about being charged for ingredients, which is not a common practice unless it's a business or there's a prior agreement. \n\nThe friend listed all the expenses, including Uber and the pasta ingredients. The amount was higher than expected. The author thought maybe around $10, but it was $25. The key points are: 1) Charging for the ingredients, 2) The amount being higher than anticipated. \n\nIn social situations, splitting costs for shared expenses like rides is common, but charging for food can be a gray area. If the friend had a clear agreement beforehand that they'd split the cost, it might be different. But since there's no mention of that, the friend's action might have been unexpected and possibly off-putting. \n\nThe author's reaction could be justified because they weren't expecting to pay for the ingredients. Friends often cover the cost of food as part of hospitality. Charging for it might come across as not being a true friend but more like a business arrangement. \n\nHowever, the friend might have had a genuine reason, like a tight budget, and thought it was fair to split expenses. Without more context, it's hard to say. But from the author's perspective, feeling that the friend was in the wrong for not being clear about charging for the meal is understandable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since the friend didn't communicate the expectation beforehand and the practice of charging for food in a social setting is unconventional, the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
