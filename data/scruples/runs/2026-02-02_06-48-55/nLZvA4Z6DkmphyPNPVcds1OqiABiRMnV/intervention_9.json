It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients and Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend charged $25 total, which includes $13 for ingredients and Uber rides. The person thought it was around $10. The main issues here are: charging for a meal that was supposed to be a social gathering, the amount being higher than expected, and the person's reaction of planning to decline future invitations.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Sometimes, when friends get together for meals, it's common for one person to cover the cost as a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs, but $13 for ingredients could be a significant portion of the total. The Uber charges are split, which is fair if they agreed to split expenses. However, the friend didn't mention the breakdown beforehand, which might have caused the confusion and the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend actually expected to split the costs, maybe they should have communicated that upfront. If the author assumed the meal was free, then the friend charging later could come as a surprise. But generally, if someone invites you for dinner, especially to their home, it's usually expected that they cover the costs as part of the hospitality. Charging for groceries might not be customary unless it's a shared expense arrangement, like roommates splitting utilities.\n\nSo, the author might feel wronged because the friend didn't set clear expectations. However, the friend might have felt it was fair to split the actual costs. The key points are whether the friend made it clear they wanted to split costs in advance and if the amounts charged were reasonable. If the author didn't expect to pay and it's a one-time thing, maybe the friend overstepped. If they had prior agreements, maybe it's fair.\n\nIn this case, the friend didn't mention the breakdown beforehand, leading to confusion. The author paid without objections but now feels it's a problem. The question is whether the author overreacted. If the friend included the meal cost in the splitting, that's unusual unless agreed upon. So the author might be right to feel it's odd, but maybe not in the wrong. However, if the author didn't agree to split costs and the friend charged them without prior discussion, the friend might be in the wrong. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. I need to decide. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. In many contexts, when a friend invites you for dinner, especially in their home, they cover the cost as a social gesture. Charging for groceries might not be expected unless it's a group expense. The Uber charges are more straightforward if split. The meal charge is the main issue here. If the friend charged for ingredients, that's unexpected. So the author's reaction is justified, meaning the friend is in the wrong. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
