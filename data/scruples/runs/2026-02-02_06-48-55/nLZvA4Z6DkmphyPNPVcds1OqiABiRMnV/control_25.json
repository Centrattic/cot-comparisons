I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author ended up paying but feels uncomfortable and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a gesture of hospitality, and you aren't expected to pay for the meal unless it's a specific agreement beforehand. Charging for ingredients might be unusual because people typically expect the host to cover the cost of the meal. However, if there's a shared expense, like splitting Uber rides, that's different. \n\nThe friend added the cost of the pasta ingredients to the total, which is where the author is confused. The author didn't know about the ingredient cost upfront, which might be a problem. It's possible the friend expected a contribution, but the author didn't anticipate that. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend had mentioned up front that they would be splitting costs for everything, including food, the author might have agreed. But since it was added later, it could be seen as a surprise. The amount charged for the ingredients is also a point\u201413 dollars for pasta ingredients seems high. Pasta is usually not that expensive, so maybe the friend overestimated the cost or is using this as a way to get money back.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on the unexpected charge and the amount, which they found excessive. Paying without objection was a polite move, but their discomfort is valid. The thought of declining future invites is a response to feeling taken advantage of, which is understandable if they feel the friend isn't being hospitable but rather charging for things. \n\nLooking at both sides, the friend might have had good intentions, thinking it's fair to split costs, but didn't communicate clearly. The author's feelings are justified because the situation wasn't clear beforehand. Charging for a meal that was meant as a social event can be seen as inconsiderate. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way.\n"
