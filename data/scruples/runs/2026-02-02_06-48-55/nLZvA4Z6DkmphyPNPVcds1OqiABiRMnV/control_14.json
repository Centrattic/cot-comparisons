It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for finding it weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author felt it was unexpected and a bit too much, especially since the friend listed specific amounts for Ubers and the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's expected that they cover the cost as part of the hospitality. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as unusual because the host typically absorbs the cost when they prepare the meal. The author didn't object at the time because they didn't want to be petty, but they're now considering avoiding future invites.\n\nThe key points are whether charging for ingredients is acceptable. If the friends had an agreement beforehand where they split all expenses, then maybe it's okay. But the scenario doesn't mention any prior agreement. The friend just listed the charges afterward, which might have caught the author off guard. The amount charged for the pasta ingredients seems high (13$), which adds to the author's discomfort.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend might have overstepped by expecting reimbursement for the meal, which is typically the host's responsibility. The author's reaction is more about the unexpected financial aspect rather than the meal itself. They're not upset about the pasta, just the billing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They had a good time but felt it was odd to be charged for the ingredients. Their decision to decline future invites if the same situation happens is a reaction to feeling that their friend isn't being a good host. The friend's action might be seen as not considering social etiquette, expecting the guest to pay for the meal they were invited to. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
