It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author's friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them $13 for the ingredients. The friend also added up the Uber rides, totaling $25. The author felt this was excessive, especially the $13 for ingredients, even though they paid without a fight. They're now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's typically seen as a favor, not an exchange. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected unless there was prior agreement. The friend might have felt that splitting the Uber costs is fair, especially if they shared the rides. But charging for the pasta ingredients is less common. People often expect the host to cover the food cost as part of the hospitality. \n\nThe author's reaction seems reasonable. They didn't argue but felt it was a bit much. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the charges, making it seem like a business transaction rather than a friendly gesture. However, the author could also be overreacting if the friend was just being thorough in splitting costs. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. Charging for ingredients when hosting a meal is unusual.\n2. The Uber costs split is more standard, but the total amount was higher than expected.\n3. The author's response was to pay without protest but plan to decline future invitations, which is a personal choice.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's approach was a bit odd, so the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
