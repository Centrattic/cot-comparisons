It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend charged them for dinner, including the ingredients, and the writer felt it was a lot. They paid but are considering not accepting future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend invited the writer to dinner, made pasta, which the writer enjoyed. Later, when settling shared expenses, the friend included the cost of ingredients for the pasta. The writer expected around $10 but was asked for $25, which included the $13 for ingredients. The writer paid without argument but feels uneasy now.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of splitting costs for shared expenses versus being charged for a social event. Typically, when someone invites you to dinner, it's considered a gesture of friendship rather than a service to be paid for. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs if it's a shared meal or a potluck, but in this case, the friend prepared the meal and then included the ingredients as part of the expense. The writer might not have expected that, leading to the feeling of being overcharged.\n\nConsidering social norms, it's common to split shared expenses like Uber rides, but charging for the cost of a meal you prepared for a friend can be seen as unusual. Unless there was prior agreement to split the cost, the friend might have overstepped. The writer's reaction of feeling weird and deciding to decline future invites could be justified because the expectation of a free meal was disrupted.\n\nHowever, the writer did pay without argument, so there's no immediate conflict. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the ingredients. If the dinner was a genuine invitation, including the meal's cost might be unreasonable. On the other hand, if the friend felt it was a shared expense (like a potluck or a group meal where everyone contributes), it might be different. But in this case, it was a one-on-one dinner, so the friend's action is questionable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the friend might be the one in the wrong for charging for the meal. The writer's feelings are valid because they expected a social visit, not a shared expense. Declining future invites is a reasonable response to avoid similar situations. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
