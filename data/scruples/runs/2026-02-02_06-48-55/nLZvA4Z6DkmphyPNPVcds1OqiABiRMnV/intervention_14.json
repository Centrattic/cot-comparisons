It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author thought it was weird and decided to decline future invites. They paid the money but felt it was too much.\n\nThe key points here are social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's generally understood that they're doing it as a favor or to spend time together, not to charge for the ingredients. Charging for groceries, especially for a casual dinner, is unusual unless it's a business arrangement or there's a prior agreement. The friend added the cost of ingredients to the Uber rides, which the author didn't expect.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time but feels it's justified to distance themselves next time. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the friend didn't mention charging for ingredients beforehand, then expecting to be charged retroactively for that might be unreasonable. However, if there was an agreement to split all shared expenses, including groceries, then maybe it's fair. But in most social situations, unless specified, people don't charge for food when hosting. So the friend might have overstepped. The author's reaction is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
