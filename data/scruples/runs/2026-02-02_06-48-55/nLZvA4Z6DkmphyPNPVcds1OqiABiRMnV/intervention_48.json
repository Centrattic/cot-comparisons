It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and had a nice time. Then, when they met up again, the friend listed expenses: Uber rides and ingredients for the pasta. The author expected around $10 but was charged $25. They paid without objections but plan to decline future invites. They're unsure if their reaction is justified.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients might be seen as turning a social event into a business transaction. However, splitting shared expenses like Uber rides is common. The issue here is the pasta ingredients. \n\nThe key points: the friend charged for both shared expenses (Uber) and the cost of the meal. While splitting shared costs is normal, expecting reimbursement for a meal prepared as a social event can be seen as unusual. People often don't expect to be charged for meals when they're hosted. \n\nSo, the author's confusion is justified. Charging for the pasta ingredients might seem odd because it's part of the hospitality. The amount might also be a factor\u2014$13 for ingredients could be considered excessive if it's just pasta. However, the author didn't object and plans to decline future invites, which might be a bit harsh. But their feelings are valid given the situation.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. Charging for a meal in a social context is not typical, so the friend's approach might be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
