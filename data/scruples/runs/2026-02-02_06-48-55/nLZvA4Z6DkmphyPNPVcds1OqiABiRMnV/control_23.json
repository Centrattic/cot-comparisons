It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses during a dinner. The friend listed out the charges, including ingredients for pasta, which the author found surprising and a bit much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary that they cover the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest for the ingredients might be seen as unusual because the host usually absorbs the cost of providing the meal. The Uber charges could be different if they were shared rides, but the ingredients part is where it gets tricky. \n\nThe author paid without objection but is now hesitant to accept future invites. The key issue here is whether the friend overstepped by charging for the meal. In most social contexts, expecting the guest to pay for the food isn't standard unless there's a prior agreement. The friend might have thought they were splitting expenses equally, but that's not how hospitality usually works. \n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients seems high. If the pasta meal cost $13 in ingredients, that's a lot for a homemade meal. The author's reaction of feeling it's a lot and considering not attending next time is understandable. They might be overreacting a bit, but the main point is the principle of the host covering their own costs. \n\nThe friend might not have realized the social expectation, but the author isn't wrong to feel it's odd. So the answer is more likely No, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend is, but the question is about the author. So answer B.\n"
