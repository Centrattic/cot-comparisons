It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them $13 for ingredients plus Uber rides. The author expected around $10 but got $25. They paid without objecting but are now considering not attending future dinners. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: charging for dinner ingredients and shared Uber rides. Let's break it down. Typically, when someone invites friends over for dinner, it's considered a social gesture and not an exchange expecting repayment unless specified. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless there was prior agreement. The Uber rides, being shared, might be more justifiable as splitting costs is common. But the $13 for ingredients seems like splitting the cost of groceries, which isn't standard unless agreed beforehand. The author didn't object, maybe out of politeness, but feels it was unfair.\n\nNow, considering social norms. In many cultures, when a friend hosts a dinner, it's understood that the host will cover the costs, and guests don't expect to pay unless it's a potluck or agreed otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected and could come off as transactional rather than a friendly gesture. The author's reaction of feeling it's weird and deciding to decline future invites isn't unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the amount charged for the pasta ingredients. If the pasta was for both of them, perhaps splitting the cost makes sense, but $13 might be high depending on what was bought. But without prior discussion, it's a surprise. The Uber charges are split, which is standard, but the main issue is the dinner charge.\n\nSo, the friend's action might be seen as overstepping by charging for the meal, especially without prior notice. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They paid up to keep the peace but are justified in their feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
