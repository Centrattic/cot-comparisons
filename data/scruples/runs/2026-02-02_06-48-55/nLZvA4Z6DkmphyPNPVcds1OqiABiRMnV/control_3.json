It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objections but feels it was excessive and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally understood that the host is covering the cost as part of the invitation. Charging for ingredients might be unusual because the meal is part of the social interaction, not a service with an expected payment. The friend itemized the costs, which includes Ubers and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part is more typical because shared rides often get split, but adding the cost of ingredients is less common unless discussed beforehand.\n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling that the charging was unexpected and possibly excessive. They didn't argue but plan to avoid future invites. The key points here are communication and expectations. If the friend hadn't mentioned splitting the meal costs in advance, the author might not have expected to pay for the ingredients. The 13 dollars for pasta ingredients seems high, so the author's confusion is understandable.\n\nIn terms of fault, the friend might have overstepped by including the meal costs without prior discussion. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They handled it gracefully by paying without a fuss but are justified in feeling it was unusual. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were the issue, not the author's reaction.\n"
