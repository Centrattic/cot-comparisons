It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The friend also listed other expenses like Uber rides. The writer paid up without argument but feels upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around friends charging for meals. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, it's expected to be a friendly gesture without expecting payment. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting hairs or being overly meticulous, especially if the meal was a nice evening spent together.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend charged for the ingredients used in making the pasta, and the total came out higher than expected. The writer feels it's weird and plans to decline future invites. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nSocial interactions often rely on unspoken understandings. If the friend didn't mention the cost upfront, the writer might not have expected to pay for ingredients. Charging after the fact could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, charging for ingredients might be more about splitting costs evenly, but if it's a small group or a casual gathering, the host might cover it as part of hospitality.\n\nHowever, the writer didn't object and paid without issue. That shows they aren't being confrontational. Their intention to decline future invites is a personal choice based on their discomfort, which is their right. The friend's action of charging for dinner might be the root issue here, not the writer's reaction.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might be overstepping by charging for the meal, which is typically a social courtesy. The writer's feelings are valid, and they're not being petty for not wanting to pay for a meal they were invited to.\n"
