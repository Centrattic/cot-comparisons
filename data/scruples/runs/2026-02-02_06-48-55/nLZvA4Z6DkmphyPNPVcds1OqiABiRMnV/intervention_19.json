It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author was invited over for dinner, had a good time, and later met up again. They were supposed to pay back the friend for shared Uber rides, but the friend also added the cost of the pasta ingredients. The author found this odd and now might decline future invites.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nNow, thinking about social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a friend, it's typically considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest for the food might be seen as breaking that norm unless there was an agreement beforehand. The friend listed the Uber costs, which are shared expenses, but the ingredients were part of the meal the host prepared. \n\nPeople usually cover their own shared expenses like Uber, but expecting a guest to pay for the cost of the meal might be unexpected. The author didn't object at the time, but their reaction afterward is to avoid future invites. \n\nIs the friend wrong for charging for the ingredients? Possibly, because it's customary for the host to cover their own meal costs when inviting someone over. The friend might be overcompensating or not realizing the social expectation. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, expecting to pay for the ingredients might feel like splitting a meal, which isn't typical unless agreed upon. The friend's action could be seen as inconsiderate or not understanding the social norm. \n\nThe author's decision to pay without argument but then decide not to attend future dinners is a reasonable response. They're not necessarily in the wrong for feeling that the friend overstepped by charging for the ingredients. \n\nSo, the friend might be at fault here for the way they handled the expenses. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
