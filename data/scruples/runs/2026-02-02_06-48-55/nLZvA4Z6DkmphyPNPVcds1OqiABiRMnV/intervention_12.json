It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe friend invited the author over for dinner and made pasta. The author enjoyed it. Then, when they met again a few days later, the friend asked for repayment of $25. The author expected around $10 for shared Uber rides. The breakdown was $7 and $5 for two Uber rides and $13 for ingredients. The author paid without objections but is now considering declining future dinner invites because of this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that the friend charged for the food.\n\nFirst, I should think about social norms. When a friend invites you over for dinner, is it customary to split the cost of groceries? I know that when people split shared expenses like rides or drinks, it's common. But food that the host prepares might be considered their hospitality. So maybe charging for food is unusual unless it's a potluck or something where everyone brings their own. \n\nThe friend charged for the ingredients used for the pasta. That seems a bit odd because when you host someone, the food is usually considered part of the hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might make the guest feel like they're paying for the meal, which isn't typical unless it's a paid dinner club or similar arrangement. \n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients is $13. If the pasta was homemade, maybe the ingredients aren't too expensive. Maybe the friend overestimated the cost or is being overly literal. Splitting the Uber rides is fair because they were shared expenses. But adding the cost of the pasta ingredients on top might be crossing a line. \n\nThe author's reaction is to feel weird about being charged for the food and considering not accepting future invites. That seems reasonable because it's not common to be charged for the meal itself in a casual social setting. The friend might have had the intention of splitting all shared costs, but including the food cost could be seen as not considering the meal as part of the hospitality. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend had a different expectation. If the friend thought they were splitting all expenses equally, including the cost of the meal, then the author might be at fault for not clarifying earlier. But usually, hosts don't charge guests for the food they prepare unless it's a business or a specific agreement beforehand. \n\nSo the author's feelings are justified because the friend's action is unconventional. The author isn't in the wrong for finding it weird. The friend might have been wrong to charge for the meal. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
