It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited the author over for dinner, cooked pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author felt it was excessive and now plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. When someone invites you for dinner, especially a home-cooked meal, expecting to be charged for the ingredients might be seen as unusual. Friends often cover meals without splitting costs, as it's considered a gesture of hospitality. However, if there were shared expenses like Uber rides, splitting those makes sense. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The friend charged for the ingredients used in making the pasta. \n2. The total came to $25, which the author found high, expecting around $10. \n3. The author paid without objection but feels justified in their reaction.\n\nNow, considering social norms, charging a friend for the cost of preparing a meal isn't typical. It can come off as transactional rather than a friendly gesture. On the flip side, if the friend felt the expenses were significant and wanted to split them, they should have mentioned it upfront. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on the expectation that a friend's dinner is a free, kind gesture. Feeling upset over being charged might be seen as justified because it's not the usual social norm. However, the author didn't object at the time, which could imply they accepted the arrangement. \n\nThe friend might have overstepped by itemizing the costs, especially the ingredients, which are part of the effort put into making the meal. That could make the experience feel less like a favor and more like a service. The author's decision to decline future invites is their right, but whether they're in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and prior agreements. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, if there was no prior discussion about splitting costs for meals, the friend might have been wrong to charge for the ingredients. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset; social expectations vary, but charging for a meal prepared for a friend is often considered impolite. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the friend's actions were out of the norm, and the author's reaction is justified.\n"
