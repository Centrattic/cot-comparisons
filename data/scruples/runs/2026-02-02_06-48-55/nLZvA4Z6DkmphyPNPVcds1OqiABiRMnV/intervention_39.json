It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who invited them over for dinner, then later charged them for the ingredients used in the pasta.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially as a friend, it's typically expected that they're footing the bill as part of the hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected, even if the cost was higher than anticipated. The key points here are the expectation of the meal being a free gesture and the amount charged.\n\nThe author felt it was weird because they didn't expect to be charged for the ingredients. The friend added up specific expenses, which the author found surprising. The author paid without complaints but felt justified in not attending future dinners. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the friend didn't communicate beforehand that they would charge for ingredients, then the author's reaction is understandable. Friends usually cover the cost when hosting, unless there's a prior agreement. The author isn't obligated to pay for the meal unless that was discussed. The friend's approach might have been a bit abrupt, and the author's decision to decline future invitations is a reasonable boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend had a legitimate reason to split costs, especially if they were sharing expenses for multiple things like Uber rides. But the main issue is the meal itself. Charging for ingredients could be seen as turning a social gesture into a transactional one, which the author found off-putting. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's action of charging for the meal wasn't clearly communicated beforehand. The author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
