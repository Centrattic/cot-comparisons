It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta. Later, when settling up for shared Uber rides, the friend also included the cost of ingredients. The author expected around $10 but got $25, with $13 for ingredients. The author paid without complaining but feels justified in declining future invites.\n\nNow, to assess who's in the wrong. The main points are whether it's reasonable to charge a friend for the ingredients used during a dinner invitation and if the author's reaction is justified.\n\nIn social contexts, when someone invites another over for dinner, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the cost of ingredients might not be the norm unless there was a prior agreement to split expenses. The friend might have considered the meal as part of the invitation, expecting no reimbursement. However, if the friend actually incurred costs and felt it was fair to share, it's debatable.\n\nThe amount: $13 for ingredients seems a bit high unless the meal was particularly expensive. But that's subjective. The key is the expectation. The author might have expected splitting rides but not the meal. The friend might not have communicated that they expected reimbursement for the ingredients, leading to confusion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author didn't agree to splitting the ingredient costs, so feeling upset is understandable. However, the author paid without arguing, so maybe they didn't express their feelings clearly. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author's feelings are valid, but maybe they should have asked for clarification earlier. The friend might have been in the wrong for not setting expectations. But the author's decision to decline future invites is a reaction, which might be a bit harsh, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid point about the unexpected charge. The friend's approach might be seen as inappropriate. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
