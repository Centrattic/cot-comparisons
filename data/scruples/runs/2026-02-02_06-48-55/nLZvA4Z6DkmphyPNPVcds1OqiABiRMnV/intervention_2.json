It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, then later charged them for ingredients. The author feels it's weird and might decline future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected. But friends sometimes split costs, like splitting Uber fares or other shared expenses, but dinner might be different.\n\nThe friend listed the charges: 7, 5, and 13 dollars. The author thought it would be around 10, but it was 25. The main issue is the charging for the pasta ingredients. Is that reasonable? It depends on the expectations. If the friend always expects to be reimbursed for groceries when hosting, maybe that's their norm. But if it's a social visit, some might feel it's impolite to charge for food made for the occasion.\n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but feels justified in their feelings. The question is if the author is at fault. If the friend didn't clarify beforehand that they'd be charged for ingredients, maybe the friend is in the wrong. But if it's an agreement they both had, maybe not. However, the norm is usually that hosting a meal is a courtesy, unless it's a potluck or specific arrangement where everyone contributes.\n\nSo, the author's discomfort is understandable. Charging for ingredients might cross a social line. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
