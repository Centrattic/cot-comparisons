It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for ingredients used in a pasta dinner.\n\nFirst, when a friend invites someone over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a transactional one. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected because the expectation is that the host covers the cost of the meal as part of the hospitality. However, people have different views on splitting costs, especially if there's a history of shared expenses like Uber rides.\n\nThe friend added the cost of ingredients to the existing debt from shared Ubers. The author was expecting around $10 but got charged $25. The main points of contention are whether it's appropriate to charge for the meal and if the amount was excessive. The author paid without objections but is now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nIn many social norms, if someone invites you over for a meal, they're not expecting you to pay unless it's a mutual agreement beforehand. Splitting Ubers is more about sharing costs for a shared expense, but groceries for a meal might be seen as the host's responsibility. However, if the friend expected to split all costs, including the meal, that's a different scenario. The key here is whether there was prior agreement on splitting expenses. If not, charging for ingredients could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author's reaction might be justified because the friend included an unexpected charge for a social event. The friend might have set an unclear expectation. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer would be B (No).\n"
