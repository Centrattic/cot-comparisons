It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author felt it was strange, especially since they expected a smaller amount for shared Uber rides. They ended up paying but plan to decline future invites.\n\nSo, the main issue here is splitting the cost of a meal. The friend included the ingredients cost, which the author considers excessive. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and mutual expectations. \n\nIn some cultures, splitting the cost of a meal is common, especially if it's a shared experience. However, if the friend didn't mention the cost beforehand, that could be an issue. The author might feel blindsided. On the other hand, if the friend considered it a fair split and communicated it, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nBut here, the key points are: the author was invited for dinner, the cost of ingredients was unexpected, and the total was higher than anticipated. The author's reaction is based on feeling that charging for ingredients is odd. However, if the meal was part of a shared activity (like a potluck) or if the friend usually expects splits, it might be different.\n\nThe author's plan to decline future invites suggests they feel slighted. But maybe the friend didn't intend to make it a financial transaction. The charge for Uber rides might be more standard, but ingredients? That's less typical unless both parties agreed beforehand.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They felt the charge was unfair, and it's reasonable to express that. The friend might have overstepped by expecting payment for ingredients without prior discussion. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
