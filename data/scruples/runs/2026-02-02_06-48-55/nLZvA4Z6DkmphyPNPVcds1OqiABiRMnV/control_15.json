It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner ingredients. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25, which included the cost of ingredients. The person thought it was only around $10 for Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a kind gesture and the host covers the cost. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as unexpected or inconsiderate. The friend listed out the costs, which adds up to $25, but the person felt it was too much and plans to decline future invites.\n\nThe user is conflicted: part of them feels justified, part thinks they might be overreacting. The key points here are whether it's normal to charge someone for dinner ingredients and if the amount was fair. The friend's approach might come off as transactional, which could explain the guest's discomfort. The $13 for ingredients seems high for a pasta meal, depending on the location and what was used, but that's subjective.\n\nThe user didn't argue at the time, which is understandable to avoid conflict, but their reaction of declining future invites shows they felt strongly. The question is about whether the user is in the wrong. Since the friend didn't communicate beforehand that they'd be charged, the user's reaction seems reasonable. They might not be at fault. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
