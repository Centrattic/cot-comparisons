It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The person was surprised because they expected a smaller amount and now feel the friend overcharged. They paid without arguing but are considering not accepting future invites.\n\nSo, the main points are: charging for food, the amount being higher than expected, and the person's reaction. \n\nIn many social situations, when someone invites another for a meal, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless it's a shared expense beforehand. Charging for ingredients might not be common unless agreed upon. The person might feel the friend is being too literal or expecting reimbursement for personal expenses. \n\nThe friend listed the charges, including Ubers and pasta ingredients. The problem could be that the host might have assumed the dinner was a gesture of friendship, not a transactional exchange. If the person didn't expect to pay for ingredients, that's a valid surprise. \n\nHowever, splitting Uber costs is more understandable if they shared the rides. But the ingredients part is questionable. Maybe the friend thought they should split the cost of the meal, which isn't typical unless discussed beforehand. \n\nThe person's reaction is to decline future invites, which is a personal choice. They didn't argue but felt justified in their feelings. The question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is the expectation. If the host didn't mention upfront that they'd charge for ingredients, the guest isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. Charging for a meal that's supposed to be a social event can be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
