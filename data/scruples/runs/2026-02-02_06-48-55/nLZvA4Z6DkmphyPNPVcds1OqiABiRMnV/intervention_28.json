It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author feels it's weird and plans to decline future dinner invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual expectations when someone invites you over for dinner. Typically, the host covers the cost, right? Unless it's a specific arrangement, like splitting the cost of shared expenses. The author was already owing money for Uber rides, which they split. But the host also charged them $13 for the pasta ingredients. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author agree beforehand to split the cost of groceries? The post doesn't mention that. The friend just listed it as something to be paid back. If they didn't discuss it in advance, charging for ingredients might be unexpected. \n\nAlso, the amount might be a factor. $13 seems a bit high for pasta ingredients, depending on what was used. But the main issue is the principle. Friends often have unwritten rules about splitting costs. If the friend expected to split the grocery bill, maybe the author should have known. But if the friend didn't mention it before, the author could be justified in feeling it's a bit much. \n\nThe author didn't object at the time because they didn't want to be petty, but now they're upset. That's a common scenario in these posts. People sometimes feel awkward about asking for money back after a social event. The friend's action might have been inconsiderate, not splitting the cost beforehand. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were invited, enjoyed the meal, and only found out later about being charged. The friend should have discussed splitting the food cost before the dinner. The author's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and planning to decline next time\u2014is a personal choice, not being in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong; the friend's approach was more questionable.\n"
