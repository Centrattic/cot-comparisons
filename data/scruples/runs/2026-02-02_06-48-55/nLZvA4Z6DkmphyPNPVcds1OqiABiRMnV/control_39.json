It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey had a friend who invited them for dinner, made pasta, and they enjoyed it. Later, when meeting up again, the friend asked for money back for shared Uber rides and the ingredients. The writer expected around $10 but was asked for $25. The breakdown was $7 and $5 for Uber rides, and $13 for pasta ingredients. The writer paid without objection but feels weird about it and might decline the next dinner invitation. They're asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) and whether their reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, I should consider social norms regarding splitting costs when friends invite each other for meals. In many cultures, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually understood that they're covering the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting the cost, especially if there were multiple people involved. However, if the meal was made specifically for the guest, then charging might be less common unless agreed upon beforehand.\n\nThe writer didn't mention discussing splitting costs before the dinner. If that's the case, then the friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients. On the other hand, if the Uber rides were shared and the cost was split, that's more straightforward. The issue here is the ingredients for dinner. The cost of $13 for ingredients seems a bit high, depending on what was bought. But if multiple people were involved in the meal, splitting the cost makes sense. However, in this case, it's just the writer and the friend. So charging for ingredients might be unexpected.\n\nThe writer paid up without arguing, which shows they\u2019re not trying to be rude. Their hesitation to accept future invitations is a personal choice, but it's understandable if they feel their friend's charging was unexpected or inconsiderate. The key points here are communication and expectations. If the friend had mentioned beforehand that they wanted to split the cost of ingredients, there might be less confusion. Since it wasn't discussed, the writer feels it's odd, and that's a valid reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. The friend might have been the one who should have communicated the expectation of splitting costs earlier. The writer's feelings are justified because the situation wasn't clear beforehand. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
