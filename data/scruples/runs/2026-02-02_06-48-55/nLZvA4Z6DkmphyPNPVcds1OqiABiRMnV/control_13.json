It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid but now feels uncomfortable and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting costs in friendships. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's usually a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might be unexpected. The author expected maybe $10 for shared rides, but got a $25 total including the pasta ingredients. \n\nNow, splitting Uber rides makes sense if they split the ride equally. But charging for the ingredients? That's more debatable. If the meal was part of the social interaction, it's common to not split the cost unless it's a specific arrangement. However, if the friend felt that the meal was an expense they incurred and wanted to be reimbursed, maybe they have a point. But the amount charged for the pasta ingredients\u2014$13\u2014is significant. The total cost of groceries for pasta is usually less than that, maybe $5-$10 depending on what's used. So maybe the friend overcharged? \n\nThe author didn't object, which shows they didn't want to cause conflict, but they feel wronged. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the meal. If the meal was an invitation, it's customary to not charge, but if the friend insists on splitting all expenses, maybe it's their way. However, expecting reimbursement for the meal's ingredients might be beyond what's considered normal in a friendship. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction of declining future invites is understandable if they feel it's not a genuine invitation anymore. The key factors are: 1) Was the meal an act of hospitality, thus not to be charged? 2) Was the amount for ingredients reasonable? \n\nI think the friend might have overstepped by charging for the meal, especially if it's not a shared expense setup. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer would be B (No).\n"
