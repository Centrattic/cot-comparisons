It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend invited the author for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought it weird and decided to decline future invites. The friend also added Uber ride costs, totaling $25 instead of the expected $10.\n\nSo, the main issue here is splitting costs when friends share expenses. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's common to not expect to pay for the meal unless it was agreed beforehand. The friend might have considered the Uber rides as shared expenses, which is reasonable if both used the rides together. However, charging for the ingredients is where it gets tricky. Typically, if a friend cooks for you, they might expect you to chip in for things like Uber or other shared expenses, but the ingredients are part of their home and might not be something they expect you to pay for unless it was a significant cost or agreed upon. \n\nThe author didn't object at the time but feels upset afterward. The friend might have thought splitting all shared costs fairly was necessary, but the author feels it's odd to charge for the ingredients. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way or acting on it by declining future invites.\n\nIn terms of social norms, charging for ingredients in a casual dinner setting isn't typical unless there's a prior agreement. The friend might have overstepped by including the ingredients, which could make the author feel uncomfortable. However, the author didn't communicate their discomfort immediately, which might be a point against them. But if the friend didn't mention splitting food costs beforehand, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting the meal to be complimentary.\n\nSo, considering social expectations and the lack of prior agreement, the friend might be in the wrong for charging for ingredients. The author's reaction, while leading to declining future invites, is a personal choice based on their feelings, which are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings or their response.\n"
