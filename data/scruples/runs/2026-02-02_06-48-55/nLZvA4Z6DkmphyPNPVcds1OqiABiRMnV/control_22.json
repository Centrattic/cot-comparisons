It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for food. The friend made pasta and later listed the cost of ingredients as part of the debt from shared Ubers. The author felt it was a lot and might decline the next dinner invite.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend invited the author over for dinner, and during a later meetup, the friend mentioned the total owed was $25, which included $13 for ingredients. The author didn't object but now feels upset about it.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. When someone invites you over for dinner, is it customary to split the cost? That depends on the relationship and prior agreements. If the friend explicitly said they would split the costs beforehand, then charging for ingredients might be fair. But in this case, the author didn't expect it. The friend just listed the ingredients as part of the debt after the fact. \n\nCharging for ingredients when you cook for someone can be a point of contention. Some people might see it as splitting costs, especially if they often share meals and expenses. Others might feel that when you host, it's part of the gesture to cover the food as a kindness. The friend might have thought the author would help with groceries, but the author didn't anticipate that. \n\nThe author paid back without objection, which suggests they didn't want to make a scene. But now they're upset and considering not accepting future invites. The key here is the friend's approach. If the friend made it clear that they would charge for ingredients beforehand, maybe the author would have adjusted their expectations. However, since it was a surprise, the author might feel it's inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the total amount might be a factor. $13 for ingredients in a homemade meal could be seen as reasonable if they usually go out and the cost is split, but if the meal was simple and the ingredients are cheaper, the author might feel it's excessive. The friend's way of adding it to the Uber debt without prior discussion could be the issue. \n\nIn terms of social norms, hosting a dinner typically involves covering the costs, but that's not a strict rule. If the friend usually splits all expenses equally, maybe this is consistent. However, the author's reaction is about the friend charging for the dinner, which they didn't expect. The friend might have overstepped by not discussing this in advance. \n\nSo, the author's feelings are justified because the friend didn't communicate the expectation of splitting food costs before the event. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
