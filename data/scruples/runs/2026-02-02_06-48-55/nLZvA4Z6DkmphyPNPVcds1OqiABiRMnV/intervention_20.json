It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs when someone invites you over. Usually, if someone hosts a dinner, it's expected they cover the costs since it's their hospitality. However, sometimes people split shared expenses like Uber rides. \n\nThe friend charged for the pasta ingredients, which might be seen as unreasonable. The user felt it was excessive, expecting around $10 instead of $25. Charging for ingredients isn't a common practice unless agreed upon beforehand. The user didn't object and paid to avoid conflict, but now they're second-guessing their reaction.\n\nThe key points here are whether the friend should have charged for the dinner and if the user's reaction is justified. The user isn't being petty; they're disappointed that the friend didn't consider it a shared experience. The friend's approach might come off as transactional, which could strain the friendship. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were polite, paid without a fight, and their hesitation to attend future dinners is a reasonable response to the friend's behavior. The fault lies more with the friend for charging for something that's typically not split. So the answer should be B.\n"
