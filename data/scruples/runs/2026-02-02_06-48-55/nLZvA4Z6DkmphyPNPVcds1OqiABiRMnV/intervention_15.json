It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objections but is now considering not attending future dinners because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's generally understood that the host is covering the cost as part of hospitality. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be seen as unexpected unless it's a mutual understanding beforehand. The author didn't expect to be charged, which led to confusion. \n\nNext, the amount charged for ingredients\u2014$13. Is that a typical price for pasta ingredients? Maybe, but the key issue is whether splitting costs for a shared meal is customary. Some people might split expenses if they're friends splitting the meal, but in this case, the friend was hosting and the author was a guest. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as being too literal or not considering the social context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they paid without objection but feel hurt and plan to decline future invites. The question is whether their reaction is justified. If the friend had a different expectation, maybe they should have clarified. However, if the host didn't mention splitting costs beforehand, the author's surprise is understandable. \n\nThe author's self-doubt is part of the question. They wonder if they're overreacting. The key factors here are communication and social norms. If the friend assumed splitting costs, maybe the author should have discussed it earlier. But since it's a dinner invitation, the expectation is usually that the host's cost is covered by the invitation as a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients might not be the norm unless it's a potluck or a specific agreement.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they didn't object at the time, which might suggest they accepted the payment, but their subsequent decision to decline future invites is based on their feelings about being charged. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether charging for ingredients is reasonable. If the friend felt they needed to split costs, maybe they should have mentioned it beforehand. The author's reaction is more about the principle of being charged for a meal they were invited to, which could be seen as a breach of hospitality norms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend's action of charging for ingredients could be the issue here. The answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
