It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients and Uber rides, totaling $25 instead of the expected $10. The author feels it's weird to be charged for the food and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary that the host covers the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for food might be seen as unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The author didn't expect to pay for the ingredients, so that's a key point.\n\nThen, the Uber charges. Sharing rides and splitting costs is common, so charging $7 and $5 for Ubers adds up to $12, which the author might expect. But the $13 for pasta ingredients seems like the main issue. Was there a discussion beforehand about splitting the cost of groceries? If not, the friend might have overstepped by expecting reimbursement.\n\nAlso, the author paid without objections but feels justified in their reaction. Declining future invites is a possible consequence. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for food, making the author's feelings valid.\n\nSocial etiquette usually implies that when you're hosted, the host's expenses are their responsibility unless agreed otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as not respecting that norm. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. However, maybe the friend thought it was fair to split all shared expenses, which could be a point of view.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is at fault. The friend's action of charging for the pasta ingredients is questionable, so the author's reaction is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
