It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is at fault for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nSo, the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and a few days later, when settling shared Uber rides, the friend also included the cost of the pasta ingredients. The writer expected around $10 but got $25 because of those added costs. They paid without arguing but are conflicted about declining future invitations.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over, it's usually understood that they're hosting, so charging for the meal might be unexpected. Even though the writer shared Uber rides, which is a common split, expecting reimbursement for the food seems odd. The amount for the ingredients ($13) is a significant portion of the total. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to split grocery costs when a friend hosts. Some people might see it as fair to split expenses if both are contributing, but typically, when you're invited to someone's home for dinner, the host covers the cost. Unless there was a prior agreement to split everything, including groceries, the friend might have overstepped. \n\nAlso, the writer's reaction is to feel justified but also worried about being petty. They paid up but are considering not attending next time. Socially, expecting to be charged for a hosted meal could be seen as making the gesture less generous, which might explain why the writer is uncomfortable. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might have mishandled the situation by charging for the dinner ingredients. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
