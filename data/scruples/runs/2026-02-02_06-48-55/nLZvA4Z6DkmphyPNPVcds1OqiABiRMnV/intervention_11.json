It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought maybe they owed around $10 for shared Uber rides but ended up being charged $25, including $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author paid without objection but now feels weird and plans to decline future invites if the same happens.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong. They mentioned they might just be overreacting but feel justified. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B)... Well, in social situations, charging a friend for dinner can be a gray area. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a courtesy, not an expense to be reimbursed. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting hairs, especially if the meal was part of a friendly gathering. The Uber charges might be more understandable if they were shared, but adding the cost of the food could be viewed as not considering the social norm of hospitality.\n\nThe friend might have a point in wanting to split costs if they had a prior agreement, but the author didn't expect that. The author's reaction\u2014paying without a fight but now being hesitant\u2014is a common response when someone feels taken advantage of, even if it's minor. However, the key issue here is whether the friend overstepped by charging for the meal. \n\nSince the friend didn't mention charging for ingredients beforehand, it might have been a surprise to the author. In many social contexts, when someone hosts, they don't expect reimbursement for food unless there's a specific agreement. So, the friend's action could be seen as inconsiderate or not understanding the social norm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
