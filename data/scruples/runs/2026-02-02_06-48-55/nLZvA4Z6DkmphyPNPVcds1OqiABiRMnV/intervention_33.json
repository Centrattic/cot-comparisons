It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author was expecting to pay back around $10 for shared Uber rides but ended up paying $25 because the friend added $13 for ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually seen as a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected and could make the guest feel like they're being billed for a meal that was meant to be a social activity. However, if the friends had a prior understanding that costs would be split, it might be different.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time but plans to decline future invitations. Their feelings are hurt because they feel it's strange to be charged for food. The friend's perspective is that she covered the cost of ingredients, so it's fair to split those expenses. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if there was no prior agreement about splitting costs, the friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients. The author's reaction is about feeling it's unusual, not about not paying what was agreed. But maybe the author should have clarified expectations beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have a valid point if she considers splitting all shared expenses, including groceries. However, charging for the food might be seen as transactional rather than a friendly gesture. The key is whether the author expected to pay for the food. Since the friend invited them, charging for ingredients could be seen as unexpected, making the author's reaction justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The friend might have been unreasonable in charging for ingredients without prior discussion. The author's feelings of being uncomfortable and deciding to decline future invitations is a reasonable response given the unexpected charge.\n"
