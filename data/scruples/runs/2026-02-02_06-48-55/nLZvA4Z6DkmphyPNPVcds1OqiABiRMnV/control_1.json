It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food during a dinner invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially as a friend, it's usually expected that the host covers the cost. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected unless there was prior agreement. The author didn't object at the time but feels uncomfortable now, which is a common reaction.\n\nNext, the amount charged. The friend listed specific expenses: Uber rides and ingredients. The Uber part makes sense if they shared the cost, but charging for pasta ingredients could be seen as splitting hairs. Friends might not expect to be charged for the cost of a meal unless it's a business arrangement.\n\nThe author's intention to decline future invitations because of this suggests the issue is more about perceived generosity and friendship. If the friend is being transactional, it might affect the relationship. But is the author wrong for feeling this way? Probably not. It's about social expectations versus personal boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author didn't object immediately, which might make them seem okay to charge, but their feelings afterward are valid. The key here is that the friend's action might be seen as inappropriate, not the author's feelings. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
