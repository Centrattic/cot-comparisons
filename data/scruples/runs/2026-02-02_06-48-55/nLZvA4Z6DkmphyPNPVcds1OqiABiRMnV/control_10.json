It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for money back. The charges included Uber rides and the ingredients for the pasta. The person is confused because they expected around $10 but got $25. They paid without objection but are now considering not attending future dinners. They're unsure if they're being petty or justified.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and norms in friendships. Typically, when someone invites you for a meal, they don't expect you to pay unless it's a specific arrangement. The friend here broke down the costs, which might make the person feel it's transactional instead of a friendly gesture. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unusual because the host usually covers the cost when they cook for someone. However, if there was prior agreement to split costs, it's different. The person didn't mention such an agreement. \n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients ($13) seems high if it's just pasta, which might be a point of contention. The Uber rides are more straightforward to split, but combining them with the meal cost could be why the person feels it's too much. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If there was no prior agreement to split expenses, then charging for ingredients might not be expected. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the charges, making it feel like a business transaction. The author's reaction of being confused and deciding to decline future invites is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't clarify the arrangement before accepting the dinner. But in most social contexts, hosts don't expect guests to pay for their meal unless it's a shared expense. So the friend's action might be the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
