It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The friend added up the Uber rides and the ingredients, totaling $25 instead of the expected $10. The author paid without protest but is now considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally understood that the host covers the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be unexpected. The Uber rides were shared, so splitting costs makes sense, but the ingredients part is where the issue lies. \n\nIn social norms, when you host someone, you usually don't expect them to pay for the food you prepared. However, if the guest contributed to the cost beforehand, maybe that's different. But in this case, the friend added the ingredients to the amount owed. The author might feel it's unreasonable because it's part of the hospitality. The friend might have a different perspective, thinking that since they shared rides and the food was prepared specifically for the guest, splitting ingredients costs is fair. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset. The author didn't object and paid, but their reaction is internal\u2014maybe they feel the friend is not a good host or is being too transactional. The question is whether that feeling is justified. \n\nSome might say the author isn't in the wrong because hosting typically includes covering the meal. Others might argue that if the friend wanted to split costs, especially if the guest is often sharing rides and expenses, maybe it's fair. But charging for ingredients might be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe author's intention to decline future invites might be a reaction to feeling the friend is being transactional, which is a personal choice. The friend's approach might be seen as inflexible or not considering social norms of hospitality. So the author's feelings are likely justified, meaning they are not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
