It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeling upset that their friend charged them for food. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later included the cost of ingredients in the amount owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, it's usually seen as a gesture of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might seem odd because people typically don't expect to pay for the food unless it's a shared expense arrangement beforehand. \n\nThe friend might have thought it's fair since they covered the Uber rides, but extending that logic to the ingredients might not be common. The writer's reaction is understandable because it's unexpected to be charged for the meal itself. However, the writer didn't object and just paid, which shows they tried to keep the peace. Their hesitation to attend future dinners is a natural response if they felt it was unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend had mentioned splitting costs upfront, maybe it would be different. But since it came up later without prior discussion, the writer's discomfort is valid. The key here is whether expecting to pay for ingredients is standard. Since it's not typical, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer would be B.\n"
