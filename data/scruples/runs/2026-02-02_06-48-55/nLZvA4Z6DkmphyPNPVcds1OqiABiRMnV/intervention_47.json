It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for food during a dinner invitation. The friend charged for Uber rides and ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's common to assume that the meal is a gesture of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected because people usually cover their own costs when hosting. However, shared rides are different; splitting the cost is reasonable since both used the service. \n\nThe author didn't object and paid without issue, which shows they understood the charges after explanation. Their main issue is the principle of being charged for the meal. Declining future invitations is their response, which might be a bit harsh, but their feelings are valid if they felt it was an overcharge or a breach of social norms.\n\nThe friend's approach could be seen as keeping a strict account, which might not align with the informal nature of a dinner invitation. The amount charged for pasta ingredients ($13) might seem high depending on what was used, but that's subjective. The key point is whether splitting costs for shared expenses is expected. If the Uber was a shared expense, splitting it makes sense, but charging for the meal's ingredients is where the line might be crossed.\n\nSo, the author's discomfort is understandable. They might not be in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's approach was perhaps too transactional for a social gathering. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
