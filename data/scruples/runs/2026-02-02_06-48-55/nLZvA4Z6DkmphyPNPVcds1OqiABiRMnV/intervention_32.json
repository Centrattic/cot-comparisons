It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients, Ubers, etc. The author ended up paying but feels it was excessive and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around friends inviting each other for dinner. Typically, when someone invites you for a meal, it's expected that the host covers the cost as part of the hospitality. Charging a guest for ingredients might be unusual unless it's a recurring thing where costs are split. The key points here are: was the dinner a one-time event, and was splitting costs discussed beforehand?\n\nThe friend included the pasta ingredients in the total owed, which adds up to $13. If the dinner was a casual invite without prior agreement to split costs, charging for ingredients could be seen as unexpected. The author didn't object at the time but now feels it's unreasonable. Declining future invites is a possible reaction, but is the author in the wrong for feeling that way?\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have genuinely wanted to split expenses, especially if they shared Ubers before. Maybe the author assumed the dinner was a gift, but the friend had different expectations. However, charging for ingredients used in a home-cooked meal might not be standard. It's possible the friend is keeping track of all shared expenses, including past Ubers and the dinner, which the author didn't anticipate.\n\nThe author's main grievance is the inclusion of the pasta ingredients. If the friend had asked to split the cost beforehand, it would be different. Since it came up later as part of a total owed, the author might feel blindsided. The question is whether the friend overstepped by charging for the meal ingredients, making the author's reaction justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend had the choice to either make the dinner as a gesture of friendship or to track expenses. If they intended to charge, perhaps they should have mentioned it upfront. The author's decision to pay without objection might be to avoid conflict, but their feelings of being charged for a meal they expected to be free isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their reaction. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
