It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner and later charged them for the ingredients used. The author felt it was excessive and decided to decline future invites. They're unsure if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When friends invite someone over for dinner, it's generally understood that the host covers the cost. Charging the guest for ingredients might be unusual unless there was prior agreement. The friend listed specific amounts for Uber and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part makes sense if they split costs, but the ingredients? That's where it gets tricky.\n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but felt it was wrong. Was the friend justified in charging for ingredients? If the dinner was a favor or a gesture of friendship, expecting reimbursement for ingredients could be seen as transactional. However, maybe the friend felt they should split expenses equally. The amount seems high for just ingredients, especially if the meal was a casual get-together.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mention discussing splitting costs beforehand. If the friend had mentioned expecting payment, maybe the author would have agreed or declined. But since it was after the fact, the author's reaction is understandable. The key point is whether charging for a meal among friends is socially acceptable. In most cases, hosts don't charge guests for food unless it's a business arrangement or agreed upon in advance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The friend might have overstepped by charging for the meal. The author's decision to decline future invites is a personal choice, but their feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
