It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend charged them for the ingredients used to make pasta during a dinner invite. The author paid without objection but now feels upset and might decline future invites. They're conflicted about whether they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend invited the author for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for Uber rides and the ingredients. The author thought it was weird, especially the ingredient part, and paid but feels it's too much. The question is if the author is in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nIn social norms, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as turning a friendly gesture into a transactional one. However, the friend did share Uber rides beforehand, which might have been an agreement to split costs. The confusion arises from the ingredient cost being included.\n\nThe author's reaction is to pay without objection but feel upset afterward. The friend's actions could be seen as expecting reimbursement for all expenses, including the meal, which might not be the norm. The author's hesitation to attend future dinners is a consequence of feeling it's too much.\n\nNow, considering cultural differences. In some contexts, splitting costs for shared expenses is common, but expecting repayment for the meal's ingredients might be unusual unless pre-discussed. The friend might have felt the need to itemize everything, but it could make the host's gesture feel less generous.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to pay, just feeling it's excessive. They're not in the wrong for being upset by the friend's approach, especially if it's the first time such a thing happened. The friend's actions might be the issue here, not the author's reaction.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The friend's inclusion of the ingredient cost might be the problem, not the author's feelings about it.\n"
