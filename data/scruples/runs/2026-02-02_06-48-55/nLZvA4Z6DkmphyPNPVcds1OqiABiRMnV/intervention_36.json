It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. The situation is that the friend invited them over, cooked pasta, and later asked for $25, which included $13 for ingredients. The author feels it's weird and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When friends invite someone over for dinner, it's usually seen as a gesture of hospitality, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected unless previously discussed. The author's reaction of being confused and feeling it's a lot might be valid because the expectation is that the host covers the cost of the meal as part of the invitation.\n\nHowever, the friend did share Uber costs, which is more common. The issue is the $13 for ingredients. Depending on the friendship and local customs, splitting costs can vary. If the friend itemized everything, it might come across as keeping track of expenses in a way that's too detailed for a casual setting. The author didn't object but plans to decline next time, which is their choice, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nArguments could be made both ways. The author might be overreacting if the friend intended to split costs and the author should have known. On the flip side, the friend might have been too direct or the amount was unreasonable. Since the author didn't argue but is now hesitant, maybe the friend went too far in calculating every expense, making the author feel it's more transactional than friendly. \n\nSo, the author's feelings are justified if the expectation was informal hospitality. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
