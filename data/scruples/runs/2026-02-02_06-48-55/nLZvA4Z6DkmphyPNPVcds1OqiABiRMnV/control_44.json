It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author was expecting a small amount but ended up paying $25, including the Uber rides and the $13 for ingredients. The author didn't object but now feels they might be overreacting and is considering declining future invites.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider social norms and expectations. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's typically seen as a gesture of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for the ingredients might not be the norm unless it's a pre-arranged understanding. The $13 for ingredients could be a point of contention because making food for a friend is usually a shared expense or not expected to be paid. \n\nThe Uber part is a bit clearer since shared rides are usually split. However, charging for ingredients might depend on the relationship. If the friend had mentioned beforehand that they'd expect reimbursement for the ingredients, maybe it's understandable. But since it came up later without prior notice, it could be seen as unexpected and possibly inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's reaction of giving the money without objection but feeling hurt and considering not attending future dinners is a common response. They aren't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have been overstepping by charging for the meal, which the author didn't agree to beforehand. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault here. The friend's actions might be questionable, but the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
