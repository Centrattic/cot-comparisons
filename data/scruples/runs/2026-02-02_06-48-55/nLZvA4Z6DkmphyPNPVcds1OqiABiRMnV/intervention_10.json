It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The friend invited the author for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author felt it was weird and overpriced, so they plan to decline future invites.\n\nThe author's question is if they're in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A or B.\n\nHmm. When friends invite each other over, it's usually a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected. The friend listed specific amounts, but expecting the guest to pay for groceries might not be standard. \n\nBut maybe they had an agreement beforehand? The post doesn't mention that. If the friend didn't mention charging for food in advance, that could be an issue. The author might not have known they were expected to pay. \n\nAlso, the cost seems high. 13$ for ingredients for pasta? That depends on where they live and what was used. But pasta can be made cheaply, so maybe it's overpriced. The author giving the money without objection shows they didn't want to argue, but their reaction is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend set up an expectation of a social dinner, then billed for ingredients without prior agreement. The friend might have been inconsiderate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
