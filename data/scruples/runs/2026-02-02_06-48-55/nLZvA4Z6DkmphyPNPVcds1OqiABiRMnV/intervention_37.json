It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients. The author paid up but feels it's odd and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally an act of hospitality. Charging for food might make some people uncomfortable because it can feel transactional. But maybe in some contexts, splitting costs is common, especially if friends often share expenses.\n\nThe friend listed out specific amounts for Ubers and ingredients. The author thought the total was higher than expected. Charging for ingredients might be a point of contention. If the dinner was a favor or a gesture of friendship, expecting payment could seem odd. However, if the friends usually split costs equally for shared activities, maybe it's fair.\n\nThe author paid without arguing, which shows they didn't want conflict. But their discomfort is valid. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the pasta ingredients. If the dinner was a social event, the friend might have been expecting reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, which is reasonable. But in many cultures, it's customary for the host to cover their own food costs when inviting guests, so charging them could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients might be seen as excessive if it's just a casual dinner. The author's reaction of planning to decline future invites is a response to feeling it's unfair. Whether the author is at fault depends on the expectations both parties had. If the friend made it clear beforehand that they'd split all costs, maybe the author should have known. But if it was a surprise, the friend might not have considered that it's customary for the host to handle food costs.\n\nSo, the author's feelings are justified. Charging for food in a social setting is not typical, so the friend might be in the wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way.\n"
