It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. \n\nFirst, the friend invited the author for dinner and made pasta. The author went, had a good time, and later met up to pay back some money. The friend calculated the debt, including the cost of the pasta's ingredients. The author found it odd that they were charged for the food, especially since the amount was higher than expected. They paid without protest but are now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nSo, the key points here are: charging for a meal made for a friend, the amount charged, and the author's reaction. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's typically an act of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as unexpected or unwelcoming. However, splitting shared expenses like Uber is more common. The author didn't object at the time, so maybe they feel wronged now. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the friend expected reimbursement for the meal, maybe there was an unspoken agreement. However, the author didn't ask to be charged for the ingredients. The friend might have set the expectation, but the author's discomfort is valid. \n\nThe author's decision to decline future invitations is a personal choice. They might feel the friend was using the meal as an expense, not a gesture of friendship. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. They might be overreacting if the friend just wanted to split costs. But if the friend's approach was unwelcoming, the author's reaction is justified.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They felt the charging for food was odd and reacted accordingly. The friend's approach might not have been considerate, leading to the author's decision. So, the answer would be B.\n"
