It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation involves a friend who invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients along with other shared expenses like Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites a friend over for dinner, it's typically considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. The host usually covers the cost as part of the hospitality. However, if there's a prior agreement or if the guests are splitting costs (like splitting an Uber ride), that's different. The issue here is the friend charging for the ingredients used in making the pasta.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time but feels justified in their feelings and plans to decline future invitations. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, expecting guests to split the cost of groceries for a meal is unusual unless\u4e8b\u5148 agreed upon. The host is expected to cover the meal as part of the hospitality. Charging for that might be seen as inconsiderate or transactional. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was transparent about the cost from the beginning, maybe the author's expectations were different. But the friend didn't mention the cost upfront and instead brought it up later. That could be seen as awkward or inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and deciding to decline future invites\u2014might be a valid response if they felt the situation was uncomfortable. However, if the author didn't clarify the expectations beforehand and now is upset about the charges, maybe that's on them for not setting boundaries. But typically, splitting grocery costs for a meal isn't standard unless it's a potluck or similar arrangement. \n\nSo, the key points are: Was there an agreement beforehand? If not, the friend might have been inconsiderate. The author's feelings are justified if the charges were unexpected and not discussed. The friend's approach could have been handled better, but the author's decision to decline future invites is a personal choice, not necessarily in the wrong. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on social norms, maybe the friend was inconsiderate, so the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's action of charging for ingredients is unusual and the author's reaction is reasonable given the lack of prior agreement.\n"
