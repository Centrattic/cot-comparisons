It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients, which surprised the author. The friend also added other expenses like Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the meal, especially the ingredients, might not be the norm unless prior arrangements were made. The author didn't expect to pay for the food, so the friend's action caught them off guard. \n\nThe friend listed specific amounts, including the cost of ingredients. This could be seen as splitting costs for shared expenses, which is fair if both parties agreed. However, if the author felt it was an unexpected charge for something they thought was a gift or part of the hospitality, then their reaction is understandable. \n\nThe author paid the money but decided to stop attending future dinners. That shows they felt wronged, even if they didn't confront the friend. The key points are whether the friend was transparent about the charges beforehand and if the amount was reasonable. If the friend didn't mention charging for the meal earlier, that's a point against them. Also, the $13 for ingredients might be seen as excessive if the meal was a simple pasta dish. \n\nIn social settings, people sometimes split expenses for things like transportation, which is common. But food is usually the host's expense unless it's a potluck or agreed otherwise. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling it's odd, especially if there was no prior discussion. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
