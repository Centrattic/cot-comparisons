It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later asked for $25 back. The author expected around $10 for shared Uber rides but was charged an additional $13 for the pasta ingredients. They paid without issues but are now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nI should consider social norms here. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's understood that they're covering the cost as part of the hospitality. Charging the guest for ingredients might be unusual. However, if the friends had an agreement beforehand to split costs, maybe it's different. The key point is that the author was charged for both shared rides and the food.\n\nThe author's reaction might be based on the principle that when you host a dinner, you don't expect the guest to pay for the meal. The $13 for ingredients seems a bit high, especially if the guest wasn't aware that they'd be responsible for that. The author might feel it's unfair to have to pay for the dinner when it was part of the social arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was fair to split all shared expenses, including the meal. But since the author wasn't informed beforehand about splitting the cost of the pasta, it could be a miscommunication. The author's confusion is valid because it's not typical to charge for a meal when you're the host unless agreed upon in advance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend's action of charging for ingredients might be the issue here. The author's reaction is about their feelings being hurt or a sense of unfairness, which is subjective. But since the friend didn't clarify beforehand, the author is justified in feeling that way. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
