It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author feels that the amount was too high and now is considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's generally expected that the host is covering the cost as part of the social gesture. Charging for groceries might be unusual unless there was a prior agreement. The friend listed out specific expenses, but the author found it unexpected and maybe excessive. \n\nThe key points here are social norms and expectations. In many cultures, when you host someone, you don't typically itemize the cost of ingredients and expect them to pay. The Uber rides could be split, but the food cost is a bit different. The author didn't object at the time, probably to avoid conflict, but their feelings are justified if they didn't expect to pay for the ingredients.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's reaction seems reasonable. The friend may have overstepped by charging for the pasta ingredients. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They handled it politely, so their feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
