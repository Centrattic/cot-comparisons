It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend made pasta, invited them over, and later charged them for ingredients. The author feels it's excessive and plans to stop attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the expectations around social gatherings. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually an act of hospitality, not an opportunity to split costs. Charging for ingredients could be seen as transactional, which might not align with the social norms of such events. The friend listed out the Uber rides and the cost of ingredients, which might come across as keeping track of expenses in a way that's more business-like than friendly. \n\nThe author didn't object when paying, showing they didn't want to cause a scene, which is polite. But their feelings of being overcharged and deciding not to attend future dinners are their personal response. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, it's common to share expenses for shared activities, like splitting an Uber fare. However, charging for the cost of a homemade meal can be seen as unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The friend might have felt that since the author was there, they should contribute, but the way it was handled could be off-putting. \n\nThe author's reaction might be justified if they feel the expectation was unspoken. If the friend expected reimbursement for ingredients without prior discussion, that could be the friend's misstep. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about an unexpected or unwelcome charge for dinner. Declining future invites is their choice based on their comfort level.\n\nSo, considering social norms and the lack of prior agreement, the author's feelings are valid. The friend may have overstepped by itemizing the cost of the ingredients, making the interaction feel transactional. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
