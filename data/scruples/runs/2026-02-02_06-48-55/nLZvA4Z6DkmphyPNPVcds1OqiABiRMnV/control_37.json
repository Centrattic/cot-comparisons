It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend made pasta and later listed the ingredients cost as part of the debt. The author paid without objection but is now conflicted about whether their reaction is justified.\n\nCharging for food can be a gray area. Friends often share meals without expecting payment, but if there's an agreement beforehand, it might be different. The author didn't mention any prior discussion. The friend added the cost of ingredients, which might not be standard unless both parties agreed. The amount seems high for just ingredients. Maybe the author expected splitting costs for shared expenses like Uber, but not the dinner itself. \n\nThe author's reaction, while not confrontational, is to decline future invites. That's a personal choice. They're not in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable with the charge, especially if there was no prior agreement. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the pasta ingredients, which could make the meal feel transactional. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the friend's request wasn't clearly communicated beforehand, and the author's feelings are valid. They handled it politely and are considering future boundaries, which is reasonable.\n"
