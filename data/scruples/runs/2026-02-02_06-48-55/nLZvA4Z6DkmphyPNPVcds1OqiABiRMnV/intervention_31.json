It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs when friends meet up. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's a kind gesture, and charging for the food might be unexpected unless it's a shared expense arrangement. The friend added the cost of ingredients to the total, which the author found surprising and possibly unfair.\n\nThe author paid without objection but feels justified in declining future invitations. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIf the friend made it clear beforehand that they would split costs, maybe it's different. But since the author was caught off guard, it might be a miscommunication. However, the friend included the ingredients, which could be seen as a personal expense. People often cover shared expenses like Ubers, but groceries for a meal at someone's home might be considered their personal expense. \n\nThe author's reaction might stem from unspoken expectations. They might not consider groceries as something to split, especially if the meal was a favor or social gesture. The friend might be overstepping by including that cost. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's approach could be the issue here. The author's decision to decline future invitations is a reaction to that, but it's their way of setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
