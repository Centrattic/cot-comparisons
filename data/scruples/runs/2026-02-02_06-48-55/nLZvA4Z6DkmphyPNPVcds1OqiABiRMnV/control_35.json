It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later listed out expenses including the ingredients. The author paid without objection but now feels conflicted and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. Friends often cover expenses for shared activities, but when it's a dinner invitation, is the food typically expected to be free? Maybe the friend thought splitting all shared costs, including ingredients, was fair. However, charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected if the guest didn't offer to contribute beforehand.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time, which might be seen as accepting the arrangement, but their discomfort now is valid. They might feel that the host shouldn't pass on the cost of preparing the meal unless discussed. The key points are communication and expectations. If the friend didn't mention the cost upfront, the author's reaction is understandable. It's about whether splitting food costs is a common practice in their friend group. If it's standard, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if not, the author isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients ($13) seems high. If the pasta was homemade and the ingredients were expensive, maybe the friend had a reason. But typically, when hosting, the host covers the cost unless there's an agreement to split. The author's feeling that it's odd is reasonable, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's approach might be unconventional without prior discussion.\n"
