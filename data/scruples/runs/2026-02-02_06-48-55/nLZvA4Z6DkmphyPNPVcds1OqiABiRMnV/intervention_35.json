It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought it was weird and expensive, paid without arguing, but now plans to decline future invites. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. If someone invites you for dinner, it's generally an act of friendship, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless agreed upon beforehand. The friend listed specific amounts for Ubers and the pasta ingredients. The author was expecting around $10 but got $25. The ingredients part is the key issue here.\n\nIn many cultures, when a friend hosts a meal, they don't expect to be reimbursed unless there's a prior agreement. Charging for ingredients could be seen as making the guest pay for the host's meal costs, which might not be customary. The Ubers were shared, so splitting those costs is more common, but the ingredients? That might be crossing a line unless it's an ongoing arrangement where contributions are expected.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time, maybe to avoid conflict, but feels justified in their reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. If the friend didn't mention charges beforehand, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, if there was an unspoken expectation of splitting costs, maybe the author should have contributed. But since the ingredients were for the pasta the author ate, expecting payment might be unreasonable unless it's a recurring thing where they pool resources.\n\nAlso, the amount seems high for ingredients. $13 for pasta ingredients seems a lot unless it was a very elaborate meal. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially if they didn't expect that. Declining future invites is a possible reaction, but maybe they should communicate their feelings first.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend might have been in the wrong by charging for the meal without prior agreement. The author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
