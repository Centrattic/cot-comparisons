It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for a dinner they made. The writer was invited over, enjoyed the meal, and later found out the friend charged them $13 for ingredients, along with Uber rides. The writer paid without objections but is now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around shared expenses. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, especially in a personal context, it's usually not expected that the guest would be charged for the meal. The host covers the costs as a gesture of hospitality. The writer's friend split the Uber rides, which is common if they're splitting expenses equally. However, charging for ingredients might be where it gets tricky.\n\nThe $13 for ingredients: if the host usually covers their own costs when hosting, charging for ingredients could be seen as splitting the cost, but in a casual friendship, this might not be the norm. The writer might feel it's unexpected because they didn't agree beforehand, which is important. If the host had said, \"I'll charge you for the ingredients,\" beforehand, maybe the writer would have been okay. But since it was a surprise, it's understandable to feel it's odd.\n\nAlso, the amount. The writer expected around $10 but was asked for $25. The added $13 for pasta ingredients is the main point. If the ingredients were expensive or if it's a one-time thing, maybe. But pasta is usually not that costly. Charging for ingredients could be seen as being overly literal about splitting costs, which might not be the social norm in many cultures.\n\nThe writer's reaction: they paid without a fight but now are thinking of declining future invites. That's a valid reaction if they feel it's unfair. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the meal. From a social standpoint, friends often don't split costs for meals when hosting unless it's agreed beforehand, especially if there's a balance of who hosts whom. The writer might not be in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients unless there's a prior agreement.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend's action of charging for ingredients might not be the norm in casual friendships, and the author's discomfort is justified.\n"
