      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients and Uber rides. The author paid without objections but feels they might be overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The main points are: charging for ingredients and Uber rides. Let's start with the food. If someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients could be seen as expecting reimbursement for the cost they incurred. However, the amount charged (13 dollars for ingredients) might be seen as a bit much if the meal was a casual get-together. People might expect you to cover the cost of the meal if you were asked, but expecting exact reimbursement for ingredients could be frowned upon, especially if it's a small group or a friendly dinner.\n\nThen there's the Uber part. The friend listed charges for two Uber rides. Splitting costs for shared expenses like rides is common and usually acceptable. However, the total came out to 25 dollars, which the author expected around 10. The discrepancy here is significant. The author paid without objection but feels upset about it. \n\nThe key factors here are the context of the dinner invitation and the expectations around shared expenses. If the Uber rides were shared and agreed upon beforehand, splitting the cost is fair. But charging for ingredients when the meal was a social event is where things get tricky. It's not typical to charge a guest for food unless it's a business arrangement or a specific agreement was made beforehand. \n\nThe author's reaction might be justified if the friend didn't mention the charges beforehand. Charging for ingredients could come across as keeping track of expenses in a way that's more transactional than friendly. The fact that the author paid without objection shows they're trying to be polite, but their discomfort is understandable. Declining the next invitation could be a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable if they feel uncomfortable with the friend's approach to expenses.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid concern about the friend's approach to charging for a social meal. The friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients, expecting reimbursement for a casual dinner. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
