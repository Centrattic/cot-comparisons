It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The friend also charged for Uber rides, which the person had expected, but the total was much higher than anticipated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally understood that the host covers the cost of the meal unless otherwise agreed. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected because people usually don't split food costs unless it's a potluck or a specific arrangement. However, the Uber rides were shared, so splitting those costs makes sense. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author was expecting a small amount (~$10) but was charged $25, which includes $13 for ingredients.\n2. The author didn't object but felt uncomfortable and decided not to accept future invites.\n3. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way or not.\n\nFrom a social perspective, splitting costs for shared expenses like Ubers is common. But charging for the ingredients used in the meal is where the issue lies. Typically, when you're invited to someone's home for dinner, the host provides the meal as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the food could be seen as making the dinner a transactional event rather than a social one. However, if the host anticipated that the guest would be staying or contributing to the cost, maybe there was an unspoken agreement, but the story doesn't mention that. \n\nThe friend's approach of listing out all the costs in a detailed manner might come off as keeping track in a way that the guest wasn't prepared for. The author might have felt that the dinner was a friendly gesture and not an invoice. The fact that the author paid without objection but is now hesitant to attend future dinners suggests a breach of unspoken expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend was transparent and just splitting all shared expenses. If the friend had said upfront, \"I'll need you to split the Uber and the cost of the meal,\" then the situation might be different. But since it was a surprise, the author felt it was unexpected. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have been too direct or failed to communicate the expectation beforehand. The author's reaction is a matter of differing expectations in social interactions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
