It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, especially a casual dinner, it's understood that the host covers the cost. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected, even if the friend is trying to be fair. The user was confused because they thought the dinner was a gesture of friendship, not a paid service.\n\nThe amount charged is $13 for ingredients. The user thought $10 was expected, but $25 total (including Ubers) seems higher. The key point is whether it's reasonable to split the cost of meal ingredients. Some people might think splitting costs is fair, especially if they're splitting the meal, but in many cases, the host covers it unless agreed otherwise beforehand. \n\nThe user didn't object and paid without issue, but they're now considering not attending future invites. That reaction might be due to feeling the cost was unreasonable or that the friend overstepped. The user's feelings are valid if they didn't agree to split costs in advance. \n\nLooking at both sides: The friend might have felt it's fair to split expenses, but the user wasn't expecting it. The friend didn't communicate this expectation before the dinner. The user's hesitation to attend again is a natural response if they felt it was an unexpected bill. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were invited and expected the dinner to be a social gesture. The friend's approach might come across as transactional, which can strain friendships. The user's reaction isn't petty; it's about unmet expectations. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
