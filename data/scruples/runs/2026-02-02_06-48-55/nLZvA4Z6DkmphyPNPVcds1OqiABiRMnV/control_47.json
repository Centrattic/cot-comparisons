It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. The host covers the cost as a way of showing hospitality. Charging the guest for the ingredients might come off as expecting reimbursement, which can be seen as odd in a friendship where expenses are usually informal and not itemized.\n\nThe friend listed specific amounts for each Uber ride and the pasta ingredients. The guest expected around $10 but was asked for $25. The guest paid without objection but is now considering not attending future dinners. The key points here are the expectation of reimbursement for a shared meal and the itemized breakdown, which might have been unnecessary or made the guest uncomfortable.\n\nThe author might feel justified because it's unusual to charge a friend for dinner, but maybe they should have discussed it beforehand. However, the friend's approach seems a bit transactional for a friendship context. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, especially since they paid without issue and aren't refusing future interactions just yet. So, the answer is B.\n"
