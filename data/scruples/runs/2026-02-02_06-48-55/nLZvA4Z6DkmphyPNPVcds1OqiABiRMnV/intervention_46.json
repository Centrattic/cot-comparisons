It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend invited the author for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for money back for ingredients and Uber rides. The author expected around $10 but was asked for $25, which included $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author paid without objection but feels justified in declining the next invite.\n\nNow, the key points here are: \n\n1. Charging for food during a friend's dinner. Normally, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's customary not to charge unless it's a business arrangement or there's a prior agreement. Charging for ingredients might be seen as turning a social gathering into a transactional one, which can feel odd or unwelcome.\n\n2. The amount charged for ingredients. The friend charged $13 for the pasta ingredients. How much is typical? If the cost of ingredients is proportional to what the host spent out of pocket, it's reasonable. But if it's inflated, that's an issue. However, the author doesn't mention that the cost was unreasonable or that the host was being greedy. The author's confusion might stem from not expecting to be charged for the meal at all, regardless of the amount.\n\n3. The author's reaction. They paid up but feel justified in not attending next time. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, friends often cover expenses when they split costs, but charging for a meal that was an invitation could be seen as inappropriate. The host might have thought it was fair to split costs, but the guest might expect the host to absorb the meal cost as part of the invitation. However, the author didn't object, which might suggest they didn't want to cause conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the host was upfront about splitting costs or charging for ingredients from the start, maybe not. But since the author was surprised and felt it was weird, their reaction is understandable. The host might have overstepped by including the pasta cost, especially if it was a social visit. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling it's weird. The host might be in the wrong for not being clear about expectations beforehand. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
