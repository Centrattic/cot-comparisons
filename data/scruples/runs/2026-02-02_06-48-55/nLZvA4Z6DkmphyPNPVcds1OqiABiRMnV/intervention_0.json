It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was invited over for dinner, had a nice time, and later when settling shared expenses, the friend included the cost of ingredients for the pasta. The author expected around $10 but was asked for $25, which included the $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author felt it was strange and decided not to object but plans to decline future invites.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. They want a choice between A (author is wrong) or B (author is not wrong).\n\nLet me consider. Charging for ingredients might not be common in friendships unless agreed beforehand. Typically, when someone invites you for a meal, it's considered a hospitality gesture, not a transaction. However, if there was a prior agreement to split all costs, maybe it's fair. The key points here: the author didn't expect the ingredients to be charged, and the friend didn't clarify this upfront. The author felt it was excessive, which is why they're upset. \n\nIs the author at fault? Maybe not. Friends often assume that inviting someone for dinner is a kind gesture without expecting payment for food. The friend might have made an assumption about splitting expenses, but it's unclear if that was discussed. The author's reaction\u2014feeling it's odd and deciding not to go next time\u2014seems reasonable given the lack of prior discussion. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend did the right thing by itemizing the costs. If they shared Uber rides before, splitting those makes sense. Including groceries might be a different matter. It's possible the friend thought they should split all shared expenses, including groceries. However, in many social contexts, the host covers the meal unless otherwise agreed. The author's confusion is valid because it wasn't clear beforehand. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong). The friend might have handled it differently by discussing the cost of groceries first. The author's reaction is justified as they weren't expecting it. Declining future invites is a personal choice but not necessarily wrong.\n"
