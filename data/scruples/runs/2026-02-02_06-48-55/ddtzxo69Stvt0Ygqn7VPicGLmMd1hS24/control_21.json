My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong after publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. So, the author's sister has a history of lying, making up stories for attention, and has been in legal trouble because of it. The sister now claims she was raped, but the author doesn't believe her and told the family she's lying. The author is now doubting if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author has valid concerns given their sister's history. The sister's pattern of lying is well-documented, so the author's skepticism might be based on real experiences. On the other hand, the topic of rape is extremely sensitive. Publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can be harmful, regardless of the person's history.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean they're lying this time. The author is making a judgment that might invalidate the sister's experience if she is being truthful. The sister might be genuinely traumatized, and the author's public accusation could cause further emotional harm. Also, the author didn't go to the authorities or encourage the sister to report the crime, which is a critical point. Reporting to the police would be the proper channel rather than making public accusations.\n\nThe author's method of confronting the sister in front of the family is another issue. Public shaming or confrontation can be counterproductive, especially in sensitive situations. It might lead the sister to feel disbelieved or not supported, which is the opposite of what's needed if someone is a victim of sexual assault. The author might have wanted to protect the family from being deceived, but the approach could have been more supportive, like encouraging the sister to seek help or report the incident through proper channels.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the sister's story has inconsistent details. While that's a red flag, the author didn't mention consulting with professionals or authorities before making the accusation. The right approach might have been to express concerns privately, suggest professional help for the sister, or involve a trusted authority figure instead of publicly denouncing her.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the burden of proof is high for accusations like this. The author is essentially making a serious claim that could have legal repercussions if proven false. Publicly accusing someone of lying about rape without evidence can damage their reputation and relationships, which is a serious consequence.\n\nHowever, the sister's history complicates things. The author isn't just dismissing a single claim but addressing a pattern of behavior. But even then, the method and timing of the author's response might be inappropriate. The key points are: the public nature of the accusation, the lack of support for the sister if she's telling the truth, and the potential harm caused by invalidating her experience.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, even if the author's concerns are valid, the way they handled the situation might be considered wrong. The correct approach would be to handle such sensitive matters with care, seek professional help, and avoid public accusations that can cause further trauma.\n"
