My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of being a compulsive liar. She's been in legal trouble for making up stories, like filing a false police report and getting kicked out of college for lying. The sister now claims she was raped, but the story keeps changing details. The author confronts her in front of the family, accusing her of lying. The family is upset, and the sister is upset, leading the author to question if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister has a history of lying, which the author is aware of. But rape is a serious allegation. Even if someone has a history of dishonesty, it's important to take their claims seriously and not dismiss them outright. However, the author is not saying they believe the sister, but rather pointing out inconsistencies and past behavior. The problem here is how the author handled the situation\u2014publicly calling the sister a liar in front of the family during an emotional moment. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history. On the other hand, the way they addressed it might have been inappropriate. It's possible that the author should have handled it more privately to avoid public shaming, even if they believe the sister is lying. Also, there's a risk of invalidating a genuine claim if the sister is telling the truth this time, despite her past. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're protecting the family from being manipulated again, but their approach could have been more supportive. It's a balance between skepticism and empathy. The fact that the sister is refusing to report to the police and changing her story might support the author's doubts, but the author's method of confrontation might have been harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are: 1) Public confrontation vs. private discussion. 2) Supporting the sister vs. protecting the family from potential lies. 3) The risk of dismissing a valid claim. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in how they handled it. Even if they have reasons to doubt the sister, publicly accusing her with the family present could have been hurtful and dismissive. The author might have been right to question inconsistencies but should have approached it differently. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
