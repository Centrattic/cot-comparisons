My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author publicly confronting their sister in front of the family about her claim of being raped, citing her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The sister has a history of compulsive lying, including legal consequences for false reports and lawsuits. The author's main concern is that the sister might be lying again, given the changing details and refusal to report to the police. However, the author publicly accused her in front of the family, which caused a family uproar and the sister's refusal to speak to them.\n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrongly. On one hand, the author might believe they're protecting the family from being misled, given the sister's past. On the other hand, accusing someone of a serious crime like rape without evidence can be harmful, even if they have a history of lying. It's possible that the sister is telling the truth this time, even if her past behavior is problematic. The public confrontation could have added trauma, especially if the sister is genuinely a victim. Also, the author didn't take steps to verify the claim or involve authorities appropriately.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the author's intentions are based on past experiences, publicly denouncing a rape allegation is a serious matter. It could discourage the sister from seeking help if it's true, and might invalidate her feelings. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive and harmful, regardless of the sister's history. The correct protocol would be to support the sister, encourage her to report to the police, and perhaps consult with a professional, rather than making public accusations based on past behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author likely acted in the wrong by publicly accusing their sister without proper evidence or considering the potential harm to her, especially given the serious nature of the accusation. The answer would be A.\n"
