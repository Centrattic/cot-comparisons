My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, and the author is frustrated with her past behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister has a pattern of making up stories for attention, including serious legal issues related to false reports. The author is concerned that this latest claim might be another lie. However, the sister's claim is about a very serious crime\u2014rape\u2014which is not something to be dismissed lightly.\n\nThe key points to consider: the sister's history of lying, the changing details of the rape story, and her refusal to report it to the police. On the other hand, the author publicly accused the sister of lying in front of the family, which could be triggering and harmful regardless of the truth. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author confronted her in front of others might be inappropriate. Public shaming, especially around sensitive issues like sexual assault, can have severe consequences and may discourage the person from coming forward if the situation were real.\n\nAnother angle is the potential validity of the claim. While the sister has lied before, each case is unique. The author assumes the sister is lying again, but there's a possibility that this time it's true. Dismissing serious allegations without evidence, especially in a public manner, can be damaging. The author might have been right to have concerns, but the method of addressing them was flawed. It's important to support the survivor, regardless of the truth, and let legal processes handle verification.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to go to the police doesn't necessarily mean it's a lie. There are many reasons someone might not report a rape, such as fear, trauma, or lack of trust in the system. The author's judgment based on that refusal could be premature.\n\nIn terms of the family's reaction, some agreeing and disagreeing with the author shows the complexity. Public confrontation might have caused more harm than good, even if the author's intentions were to prevent further lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author's concerns might be valid given the sister's history, the approach taken was inappropriate. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime in front of their family is a serious accusation that can have lasting emotional effects. The author should have approached this more sensitively, perhaps by discussing privately or supporting the sister's decision to seek help or legal action if the claim is true, rather than publicly invalidating her experience.\n"
