My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister's allegations of being raped, and the author publicly called her out in front of family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of making up stories for attention. She's been in legal trouble before for false reports, like claiming a roommate attacked her with a knife when she actually stabbed herself. She's also been sued for slander and libel. The author feels that this current story about being raped is another lie because the details keep changing. The sister initially said it was one man in a park, then two men kidnapping her, and the time frame keeps shifting from \"spring last year\" to \"two years ago in December.\" Plus, she's refusing to report it to the police.\n\nThe author confronted her in front of the entire family, which caused a big reaction. Now, they're second-guessing if they were wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons to be suspicious given the sister's history. It's possible that the sister is lying again, and the author is trying to prevent her from causing more harm, like legal issues if she falsely reports this. The author might think they're protecting the family from being manipulated again.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the sister has lied before, it's still important to take allegations of rape seriously. The author publicly accused her of lying without providing evidence, which could be very damaging if the sister is telling the truth this time. Publicly calling her a liar could discourage her from seeking help if she actually was raped. Also, the author didn't support her in other ways, like encouraging her to go to the police, which is a key step in addressing such claims.\n\nThe author's approach was confrontational and done in front of the family. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the sister privately first, express concerns without publicly shaming her, and perhaps involve a professional or authorities if there's a pattern of false claims. The author's public confrontation might have invalidated her feelings and caused further trauma, especially if she's genuinely suffering.\n\nAlso, there's a risk that even if the sister has lied before, this could be a rare exception where she's telling the truth. The author's immediate dismissal without considering that possibility could be wrong. Rape is a serious issue, and the consequences of not believing someone can be severe, even if there are doubts.\n\nThe author's motivation is to stop the sister's lies, but the method used might have been harmful regardless of the sister's truthfulness. The family's reaction shows that there's a split, and the sister is now estranged from the author. The author might need to consider whether their approach was more harmful than the sister's potential lies.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns might be understandable given the sister's history, the way they handled the situation\u2014publicly confronting and accusing the sister without evidence\u2014could be seen as wrong. It's important to balance skepticism with empathy and proper channels for addressing such serious accusations.\n"
