My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author accuses their sister of lying about being raped because of her history of lying. The sister has a pattern of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. The author confronted the sister publicly in front of the family, saying they don't believe her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of lying, which might make the author skeptical. But rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it can have significant consequences. Even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean they're lying now. The author might be projecting past behavior onto the current situation without sufficient evidence.\n\nThe author's approach was public confrontation, which could be hurtful and counterproductive. It might have invalidated the sister's feelings and made her less likely to seek help if the situation is real. Also, the sister's changing story is a red flag, but that could be due to trauma rather than lying. People with trauma sometimes have fragmented memories or might not immediately remember all the details.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't report the alleged rape to authorities. Instead, they publicly accused the sister, which could prevent the sister from getting the support she needs if it's true. The right approach might be to encourage her to come forward to the police or a trusted authority figure, rather than dismissing her publicly.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the sister's history is valid. There's a balance between believing victims and recognizing patterns of deceit. But accusing someone of lying without concrete evidence can be damaging. The author might not be wrong in their skepticism, but the way they handled it was problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely caused harm regardless of the sister's truthfulness. Dismissing a rape claim, even with reasons, can be seen as invalidating and could be wrong. But the sister's history complicates things. However, the method of public confrontation and the potential discouragement of seeking help if it's real points towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
