My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of making up stories for attention. She's been sued for slander and libel, filed false police reports, and even got kicked out of college for lying. Now the sister is claiming she was raped, but the details are changing each time, and she's not going to the police. The author confronts her in front of the family, accusing her of lying again, which causes a family uproar.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the sister's history is pretty bad. She has a pattern of lying, which does raise a red flag. The author is concerned about her sister's behavior and wants to prevent her from getting into more trouble. But on the other hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright, especially in public, could be harmful. Even if the sister has lied before, it's possible she's telling the truth now, or at least the author shouldn't make that judgment publicly without proper investigation.\n\nThe key here is the author's approach. Telling the sister and the entire family that she's lying without giving her the opportunity to provide evidence or without going through proper channels (like involving authorities) might be inappropriate. Even if the author has valid concerns, confronting her in front of the family in an emotional way could damage their relationship and invalidate any potential truth in her claims. The author should have considered more private and supportive ways to address the situation, maybe consulting with other family members or professionals before making such a public accusation.\n\nAlso, the sister not going to the police might be due to her own fears or trauma, not just lying. The author's assumption that she's lying again might be ignoring her potential genuine distress. So, while the sister has a history of lies, the author's public confrontation is probably not the right approach. The author should take responsibility for the way they handled it, regardless of their suspicions.\n"
