My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, but the author confronted her in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of making false claims, including legal issues. The author's concern is that this pattern might continue. However, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright can have severe consequences.\n\nThe key factors here: the sister's past behavior vs. the gravity of the current claim. The author points out inconsistencies in the story, which the sister hasn't clarified. But the author also admits that rape is a serious issue and that the sister is refusing to report it, which is a red flag.\n\nNow, the author confronted the sister publicly, which could be seen as harsh. Even if the author's intent was to prevent another false accusation, doing it in front of the family might have been unkind and potentially harmful. The sister might feel invalidated, which could prevent her from seeking help if she's telling the truth. \n\nBut the sister's history complicates things. The author's skepticism is understandable given the past. However, even with that history, accusing someone of lying about rape is a huge call. The author might not have considered that the sister could be truthful now, despite her past. Also, the author didn't seek evidence or involve someone else (like authorities) before confronting her publicly.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop a potential false report. On the other, they might be invalidating a serious claim. The public confrontation adds to the problem because it could alienate the sister and make her less likely to come forward if she's truthful.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). Publicly accusing someone of lying about rape, even with prior issues, is a serious matter. The author's approach was confrontational without seeking support or evidence. They should have handled it more privately and perhaps involved professionals if they were concerned about false reporting.\n"
