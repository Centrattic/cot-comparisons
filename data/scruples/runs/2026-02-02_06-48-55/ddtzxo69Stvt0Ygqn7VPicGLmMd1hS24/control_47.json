My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister has made multiple false claims in the past, leading the author to believe she's lying now about a rape. The author publicly confronts the sister in front of the family, which caused a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. The author mentions she's a compulsive liar with a documented history of making up stories for attention. There's evidence like lawsuits, a false police report, and being kicked out of college. That's a lot of red flags. The author is not just guessing; there's a pattern here.\n\nBut then, the subject here is a serious one\u2014alleged rape. That's a traumatic experience, and it's important to handle these situations with care. Even if someone has lied before, it's possible they could be telling the truth this time. However, the sister's story keeps changing, and she hasn't reported it to the police. The author is concerned that she might be lying again, leading to potential legal issues for her.\n\nNow, the author's actions: publicly calling out the sister in front of the family. The family is divided, and the sister is upset. The author might have been trying to be honest and protect the family from being manipulated, but the way they did it was confrontational and public. That could have been hurtful and unwise, even if the intention was good.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for the truth based on past experiences. On the other hand, the topic is sensitive, and public confrontation might not be the best approach. It's possible the author should have spoken to the sister privately first, or consulted with others before making the accusation in front of everyone. Also, the author's approach might have dismissed the sister's feelings and potential validity of the claim, which could be harmful if she was actually telling the truth.\n\nSo, considering the sister's history, the author's concerns are not baseless. But the method of addressing it might be what's problematic. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for questioning the sister's story, but the way they communicated their doubts could be seen as wrong. The key here is balancing the need to address the sister's pattern of lies without dismissing the possibility that this might be a genuine case. The public confrontation might have been the main mistake, hence the author could be partially at fault for their approach.\n"
