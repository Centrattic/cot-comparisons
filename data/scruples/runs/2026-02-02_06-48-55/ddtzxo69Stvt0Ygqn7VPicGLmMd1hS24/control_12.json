My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories and being legally sanctioned for it. The author's sister has a pattern of lying, changing stories, and not reporting to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a serious accusation about their sister's credibility, which is a sensitive topic. Rape is a grave matter, and dismissing someone's claim can have severe consequences, even if there's a history of dishonesty. However, the sister's pattern of lying is well-documented, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront their sister in front of the entire family, which might have been hurtful and public. Even if there's suspicion of lying, the method of addressing it can affect how it's perceived. Publicly shaming someone, especially about such a sensitive issue, could be seen as harmful regardless of the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt justified given the sister's history. But it's important to balance the sister's past behavior with the gravity of the current claim. Even with a history of lying, it's possible that this time is different. The author's approach might prevent the sister from seeking help if she's telling the truth. \n\nAlso, the author didn't take steps to verify the claim or encourage the sister to report it to authorities, which could have been a better course of action. Instead, they publicly accused her, which could invalidate her experience and damage family relationships. \n\nSo, considering the approach taken and the potential harm caused, the author might be in the wrong. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation and public accusation could be inappropriate. The right approach might involve private discussion, encouraging legal action, or seeking support rather than public confrontation.\n"
