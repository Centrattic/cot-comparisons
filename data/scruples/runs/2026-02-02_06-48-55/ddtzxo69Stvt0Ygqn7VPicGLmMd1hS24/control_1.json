My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. The sister recently came forward with a rape claim, changing her story and not providing specific details. The author confronted her in front of the family, saying they don't believe her and compared it to her past lies. The family is divided, and the sister is now upset, not even looking at the author.\n\nFirst, I should consider the seriousness of the accusation. Rape is a severe crime, and dismissing it, especially in a public manner, can have serious consequences. Even if the sister has lied before, making such a claim is a big deal. The author might think they're protecting the family from another lie, but publicly accusing someone of a crime like rape can be damaging and may not be the right approach.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of how the author addressed it. Confronting the sister in front of the entire family could be seen as shaming her or not providing a safe space. It's important to handle sensitive issues with care, especially when someone's credibility is at stake. The author might have valid concerns based on the sister's history, but the method of confrontation could be inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to go to the police is a red flag, but that doesn't automatically mean she's lying. Some victims don't report due to fear, trauma, or other reasons. The author might not fully understand why she's not going to the police, so jumping to conclusions could be a mistake.\n\nThe author's history with the sister's lies is significant. They mention multiple instances where the sister's stories were proven false. However, even with that history, it's crucial to approach the current situation with sensitivity. Publicly denouncing the claim without giving the sister the benefit of the doubt, or without proper evidence, could be wrong. The author might need to handle it more privately and perhaps encourage the sister to seek help for her compulsive lying rather than just confronting her in front of others.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the sister. If she is indeed a victim, the author's public accusation could invalidate her experience, cause further trauma, and discourage her from coming forward in the future. Even if the sister has lied before, treating this claim differently because of her history might not be fair or supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their past experiences with the sister's lies are too numerous and damaging to ignore. They could be trying to protect the family from being misled again. However, the way they handled it\u2014publicly accusing her in a family setting\u2014might not be the best approach. It's possible that a more private conversation, perhaps involving professional help, would be more constructive.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, accusing someone of a crime like rape without evidence can have legal repercussions. The author might be risking their sister's trust and potentially her well-being by not supporting her if she's telling the truth this time. Even if they are right about her lying, the method of confrontation could be harmful and not in the best interest of the family dynamics.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author might have good intentions based on their sister's history, but the way they addressed the issue is problematic. Dismissing a serious claim like rape in public and without proper support or evidence is generally considered wrong, as it can harm the person and their willingness to seek help. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because validating the sister's experience, regardless of past issues, is important, and public confrontation is not the right way to handle it.\n"
