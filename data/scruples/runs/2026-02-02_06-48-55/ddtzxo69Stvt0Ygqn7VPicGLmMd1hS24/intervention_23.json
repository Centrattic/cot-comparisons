My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author publicly confronting their sister in front of family, accusing her of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, but this is a serious allegation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is described as a compulsive liar with a history of making up stories for attention, leading to legal issues. The author has a valid reason to be skeptical based on past experiences. However, the key here is the subject matter: the sister is accusing of being raped, which is a serious and sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront her in front of the entire family, pointing out inconsistencies and accusing her of lying. Even though the author may have a justified reason to doubt the sister's claims, the manner in which they addressed it could be problematic. Publicly humiliating someone, especially regarding such a traumatic and sensitive issue, might exacerbate the situation and prevent the sister from seeking help if she were telling the truth.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police adds complexity. If she's genuinely a victim, there could be reasons beyond her control for not reporting\u2014like fear, shame, or not knowing how to come forward. The author's public accusation might push her further away from seeking support. On the other hand, if the sister is lying, the author might be protecting the family from ongoing manipulation.\n\nThe author's intention might be to stop their sister's lies, but the method could be seen as disrespectful and harmful. It's important to consider the potential impact on the sister if she were telling the truth. Publicly accusing someone of lying about a rape can be seen as dismissive and invalidating, regardless of the person's history. Even if the author believes they're right, the approach might have been wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author might have a point about the sister's past behavior, the way they handled the situation could be considered inappropriate. It's possible the author should have addressed the issue privately, perhaps working with authorities or professionals rather than making a public accusation. This would allow for a more measured response without publicly shaming the sister, which can have its own consequences.\n\nIn summary, while the sister's history raises valid concerns, the author's public confrontation in front of the family could be seen as inconsiderate of the situation's gravity. The answer hinges on the approach taken rather than the underlying skepticism. The author might not be entirely wrong for doubting, but the manner of their response is likely problematic.\n"
