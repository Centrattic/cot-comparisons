My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a sister who's been making up stories for attention. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. Now, the sister is claiming she was raped, but the story keeps changing. The author confronts the sister in front of the family, accuses her of lying, and compares it to past lies. The family is upset, the sister is upset, and the author is now doubting their approach.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the sister's history of lying. The author provides examples of past incidents where the sister lied and got legal consequences. The sister's current story about rape is inconsistent, with changing details and refusal to report to the police. The author is concerned it's another lie and confronted her publicly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to confront her like that. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the family from the sister's lies and prevent her from committing a serious legal mistake (like false rape allegations). On the other hand, the author publicly called the sister a liar, which could be very hurtful and dismissive. Rape is a serious accusation, and even if the sister has a history of lying, the author's approach might not be appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the sister has a proven history of making up things. The author isn't just accusing without reason. The sister's story has inconsistencies, which the author points out. The author might believe that the sister is lying again, and the author's intention is to prevent her from getting in more trouble.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it\u2014public confrontation\u2014might be the issue. Even if the author's concern is valid, calling the sister out in front of the family could be damaging. It's possible that the author should have handled it more privately, maybe spoken to the sister alone or informed the family first before confronting her. Also, even with a history of lying, the author shouldn't dismiss the possibility that this might be true. Rape is a serious matter, and the author's public accusation could invalidate a genuine trauma if the sister is telling the truth this time.\n\nThe dilemma is between protecting the family from the sister's lies versus potentially undermining a real situation. The author's approach was harsh and public, which might be seen as wrong regardless of the sister's history. The right approach might have been to express concerns privately and supportively, encouraging the sister to speak with authorities while not publicly accusing her of lying.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, even if the author's concerns are based on past behavior, publicly accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter. It's important to handle such situations with sensitivity and support, not public confrontation. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation is inappropriate and could cause further harm if she is actually a victim. The author should have approached the situation more carefully and privately.\n"
