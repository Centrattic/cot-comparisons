My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is they're questioning if they were at fault for accusing their sister of lying about being raped, given the sister's history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's background. The author mentions she's a compulsive liar with multiple legal issues from past lies. That's a big point. Compulsive lying for attention, being sued for slander and libel, and even filing a false police report. So there's a pattern here that the author is pointing out. \n\nBut the key issue is the accusation of rape. Rape is a serious crime, and the author is dismissing their sister's claim based on her past behavior. Even if she has a history of lying, that doesn't necessarily mean this time is a lie. Each situation is different, and trauma can affect how someone remembers events. The sister's story changing over time is a red flag, but so is the author's public accusation without any evidence.\n\nThe author confronted their sister in front of the whole family. Even if they have reasons to doubt, doing it in public might have been more harmful. The sister is already vulnerable, and the author's approach could have invalidated her feelings or made her less likely to seek help. Also, the author didn't take the proper steps, like reporting to the authorities, which is the appropriate channel for such allegations.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's refusal to go to the police. But the onus isn't on the accuser to pursue legal action; it's the responsibility of the authorities to investigate. The author's job isn't to judge but to support or encourage the proper process. By publicly calling her a liar, the author might have caused further emotional harm, especially if the sister is telling the truth.\n\nHowever, the sister's past behavior does raise legitimate concerns. The author's frustration is understandable given the sister's history. But the approach taken was confrontational and public, which could be seen as insensitive. Even if the sister is lying, the method of accusation matters. It's possible that the author should have discussed their concerns privately and perhaps advised the sister to report the incident properly instead of making public accusations.\n\nIn terms of the broader social context, rape is underreported, and many survivors face disbelief. The author's actions might contribute to a hostile environment for someone who might be telling the truth. Even if there are inconsistencies, the appropriate response is to support the survivor and encourage reporting, not public shaming based on past behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for their public accusation and dismissal of their sister's claim without proper evidence or support channels. Even if the sister is lying, the method of confrontation and the lack of a supportive approach could be problematic.\n"
