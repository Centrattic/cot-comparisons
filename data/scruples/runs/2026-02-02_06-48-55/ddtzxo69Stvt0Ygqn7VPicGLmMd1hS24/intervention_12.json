My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for questioning their sister's rape claim. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying and has been in legal trouble for making up stories for attention. The sister now claims she was raped, but the story keeps changing, and she won't go to the police. The author publicly confronts the sister in front of the family, accusing her of lying. The family is divided, and the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Rape is a serious and sensitive issue. Even if someone has a history of lying, the act of accusing them of lying about such a traumatic event could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The author acknowledges the sister's past, but that doesn't necessarily justify public confrontation. The sister might be in genuine distress, and dismissing her could prevent her from getting the support she needs if the claim is true. However, if the author has valid reasons based on past behavior, maybe there's justification.\n\nBut even if there are reasons to doubt, the method of confronting her in front of the family might be unhelpful. Public shaming could isolate her further and might not lead to a constructive resolution. The author might have a point in being concerned about false accusations, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's refusal to report to the police is a red flag. In real cases of rape, victims often face barriers to reporting, but the author's sister's behavior (changing details, not reporting) aligns with her history of lying. Yet, the author's public accusation could make the sister less likely to seek help if she actually was a victim.\n\nThe key here is balancing belief in the sister's past behavior against the gravity of the current claim. Even with a history of lying, it's possible she's telling the truth this time. The author's approach might have been too harsh and public, contributing to a hostile environment. The appropriate response might have been to express concerns privately and supportively, perhaps encouraging her to seek help rather than publicly accusing her.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author made a mistake in how they handled the situation, even if their concerns were based on past experiences. The public confrontation and accusation without a more private and supportive approach likely added harm, regardless of the truth behind the sister's claim. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
