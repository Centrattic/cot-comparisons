My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister after she claimed to be a victim of rape. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues related to false reports.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's history of lying is significant. She's been sued for slander and libel, filed false police reports, and lied about college incidents. The author is skeptical because the story keeps changing and she's not cooperating with authorities. However, the author publicly accused her of lying in front of the family, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is concerned about the sister's history and wants to prevent potential legal trouble. On the other hand, public accusation of a serious crime like rape, even with prior context, can be harmful. Rape is a serious issue, and dismissing someone's claim can invalidate their experience and discourage them from seeking help. The author's public confrontation might have exacerbated the situation, causing emotional distress and family conflict.\n\nEven if the sister has lied before, each claim should be treated with caution but also with sensitivity. The author's approach was blunt and public, which might not be the best way to handle such a sensitive issue. It's possible that the author should have approached the sister privately first or encouraged her to report it through proper channels instead of making a public accusation. The fact that the sister is reluctant to go to the police is concerning and might indicate other issues, like fear or shame, which the author didn't address.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial judgment might be clouded by past experiences. While the sister's history is a factor, it's important not to assume guilt without evidence. The author's public accusation, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as dismissive of the sister's possible trauma. The family's mixed reaction shows that the approach was problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the sister's history of lying, the way they addressed the situation was inappropriate. Publicly accusing someone of a serious crime without a private discussion first could be considered wrong. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their method of confrontation was unkind and potentially harmful, regardless of their intentions.\n"
