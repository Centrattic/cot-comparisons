My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. The sister now claims she was raped, but the author doesn't believe her and called her out in front of the family. The sister's story has inconsistent details, and she's not reporting it to the police. The author is second-guessing if they were wrong to confront her publicly.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a heavy accusation. Even if the sister has a history of lying, that doesn't necessarily mean this specific claim is false. Rape is a traumatic experience, and people can react differently, sometimes not reporting immediately or having inconsistencies due to stress or fear.\n\nThe author's approach was to publicly confront the sister in front of the family. This could have been hurtful and dismissive, potentially worsening the sister's trauma if the claim is true. Publicly calling someone a liar, especially in a family setting, can be damaging regardless of the truth. It might also discourage the sister from seeking help or support if the claim is genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's past behavior. The sister's pattern of lies is documented, and the author is trying to protect the family from being misled. However, the method of confronting it in a public, emotional setting might not be the best approach. A private conversation with the family to discuss concerns, perhaps involving a trusted authority or counselor, might have been more appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. The author is not in a position to determine the truth of the rape claim. That's a matter for law enforcement or legal authorities. The author's role should be to support the sister if the claim is true, rather than publicly accusing her of lying. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the proper course of action would involve advising the sister to report the incident to the police and letting the legal system handle it. However, the sister refuses to go to the police, which complicates things.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact on the family. The author's confrontation caused a rift, with some family members agreeing and others disagreeing. Public confrontations can lead to long-term family tensions, especially when emotions are high.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, individuals are generally expected to take allegations of serious crimes seriously, unless there's clear evidence of fabrication. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of the sister's potential trauma, even if the sister has lied before. The key issue here is balancing the sister's history of lies against the gravity of a rape accusation.\n\nI should also consider that false rape accusations are rare, although not impossible. The author's assumption that the sister is lying might be influenced by past experiences, but each situation should be evaluated on its own merits. Dismissing the claim based on past behavior without concrete evidence could be harmful.\n\nIn summary, while the author has legitimate concerns about the sister's credibility, the way they handled the situation\u2014publicly accusing her in front of the family\u2014was likely inappropriate. The author should have taken a more private and supportive approach, perhaps encouraging the sister to seek help or involving professionals to handle the situation more sensitively. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
