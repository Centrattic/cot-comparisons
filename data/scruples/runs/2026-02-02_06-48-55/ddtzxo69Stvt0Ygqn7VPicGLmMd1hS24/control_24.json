My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. Now the sister is claiming she was raped, and the author publicly confronts her, saying they don't believe her. The sister changes her story and refuses to report it to the police. The author is questioning if they did the wrong thing by confronting her in front of family.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's history. The user mentions multiple instances of her lying for attention, legal problems, and changing stories. That suggests a pattern of behavior. But rape is a serious accusation, and even if there's a history, it's important to handle it carefully because of the trauma involved.\n\nThe author's approach was to publicly accuse the sister of lying during a family gathering. That's a big move. Publicly confronting someone about such a sensitive issue could be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful, especially if the person is genuinely a victim. Even if the sister has lied before, the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt here. It's possible that the sister is telling the truth this time, despite past issues. \n\nHowever, the sister's inconsistency in the story and refusal to report might make the author's skepticism understandable. But the way the author handled it\u2014publicly calling her out in front of family\u2014could have exacerbated the situation. It's possible that the author should have talked to the sister privately first, or perhaps encouraged her to report the incident through official channels. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a documented history of making things up, which might make the author's concern valid. But even with that, the method of confrontation matters. Publicly accusing someone of lying, especially in a family setting where emotions are high, can be seen as inconsiderate and damaging. The author might have wanted to protect the family from being misled, but the approach could have been more compassionate and less confrontational.\n\nAlso, there's a risk in dismissing a rape claim, even if there's suspicion. Rape is underreported, and victims might not tell their stories consistently, especially if they're in shock or traumatized. The author's public accusation might invalidate the sister's feelings, whether she's lying or not. \n\nSo, while the author has reasons to be skeptical, the way they handled the situation could be seen as wrong because it's a public confrontation, lacks support for the sister if she is a victim, and might have worsened the family dynamics. The author might have acted out of frustration and a desire to stop the sister's lies, but in doing so, they may have failed to consider the seriousness of the accusation and the potential impact on their sister, regardless of the truth.\n"
