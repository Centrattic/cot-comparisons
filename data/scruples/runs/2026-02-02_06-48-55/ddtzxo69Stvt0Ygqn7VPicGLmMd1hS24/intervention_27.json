My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about lying about being raped. The author provides a detailed background about their sister's history of lying, with past instances of lawsuits and false police reports. They also mention inconsistencies in the sister's current story about rape, like changing the number of assailants and the timeline, as well as her refusal to report to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. The author's sister is an adult in her mid-30s with a known pattern of deceit. The author is concerned about the potential consequences of a false rape accusation, which could lead to legal issues for the accused if the story is fabricated. However, rape accusations are extremely serious, and dismissing them outright, even with skepticism, can have severe consequences for the accuser if they are telling the truth.\n\nThe author chose to confront the sister in front of the entire family, which might have been hurtful and public. Even if the sister has a history of lying, the rape allegation is a sensitive issue. The author's approach might have invalidated the sister's experience if she is indeed telling the truth. The sister might feel betrayed and not supported, which could prevent her from seeking help even if it's true.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns given the sister's history. They might be trying to prevent a false report that could harm others. However, there's a fine line between being cautious and being dismissive. The author could have handled it more carefully, perhaps by consulting with a professional or the authorities before making such a public accusation.\n\nLegally, there's a difference between expressing skepticism and accusing someone of lying without evidence. If the sister did report the rape to authorities and it was found to be false, the author might not be liable. But in a family context, the author's public confrontation could be seen as harmful regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n\nEthically, the key points are the potential harm to the sister if she's truthful versus the risk of a false report. The author's approach might have been too direct and public without ensuring all facts were considered. It's possible that the sister is genuinely traumatized and the author's reaction could prevent her from getting the support she needs.\n\nIn summary, while the author has reasons to be skeptical, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter without a formal investigation is problematic. The author's actions might be seen as invalidating the sister's experience and could have done more harm than good, regardless of the truth. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their intent was to prevent a potential false report.\n"
