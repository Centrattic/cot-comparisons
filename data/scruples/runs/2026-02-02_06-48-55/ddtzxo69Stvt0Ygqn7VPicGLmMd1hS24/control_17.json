My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying about traumatic events, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. The author mentions she's a compulsive liar with legal issues from past false claims. That's significant because it might make the author skeptical. However, rape is a serious accusation, and even if the sister has lied before, that doesn't automatically mean she's lying this time. Each situation is different, and trauma can affect how someone recounts events.\n\nThe author confronted the sister in front of the entire family, which could be seen as public shaming. Even if the author's intentions were to call out lies, doing it in front of others without private discussion first might have been hurtful. Public confrontation can be damaging, especially in sensitive situations like this. The family's mixed reactions also show the complexity of the issue.\n\nAnother point is that the sister is refusing to report to the police. The author is concerned about potential legal consequences if the sister is lying again. But the author's approach was to accuse her publicly without offering support or verifying the situation further. It might have been better to address the sister privately first, perhaps suggesting getting legal or therapeutic help to address her history of lying and the current claim.\n\nThe author's justification is based on the sister's past behavior and inconsistencies in the story. However, everyone can have inconsistencies when recounting traumatic events, even if they're truthful. The sister's refusal to report might be due to fear, shame, or other reasons unrelated to lying. The author didn't consider alternative explanations for the sister's behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author believes the sister is lying, publicly accusing her without evidence can be harmful. It might invalidate the sister's experience if she's telling the truth, and it can strain family relationships. The author's approach might have been too confrontational and lacked empathy.\n\nSo, while the sister's history is a factor, the way the author handled the situation\u2014public confrontation, making accusations without private support, and dismissing the sister's claim outright\u2014could be seen as wrong. The author should have taken a more supportive and less accusatory approach, perhaps seeking professional help to navigate the situation.\n"
