My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accused their sister of lying about being raped, given her history of lying. The sister has a pattern of making up stories for attention, multiple lawsuits, and past incidents where she lied, like the knife attack and the plagiarism. The sister's story about the rape changed details over time and she's not going to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is questioning their sister's credibility based on past behavior. However, there's a risk in dismissing serious allegations, especially given that rape is underreported and many victims don't come forward due to fear, shame, or other reasons. The author's approach of publicly confronting the sister might have been harsh, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nThe sister's history is a factor, but each situation is unique. The author might believe their sister is lying because of the inconsistencies and past behavior, but it's possible the sister is telling the truth this time. The author's response was to accuse her in front of the family, which could have been hurtful and discouraging for the sister to seek help if she truly was a victim.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of supporting a family member who comes forward with such a traumatic experience. Even if there are doubts, it's crucial to take the claim seriously, encourage professional help, and avoid public confrontation that could invalidate the person's feelings. The author might have acted out of frustration but not in a supportive way.\n\nHowever, the author isn't in the wrong in the sense that they have legitimate concerns based on past behavior. The problem is how they handled it. Publicly accusing someone of lying, especially about a serious allegation like rape, can be harmful regardless of the truth. It's important to approach such situations with sensitivity and perhaps involve professionals rather than family confrontation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were appropriate. While their concerns might be valid, the public confrontation and dismissive approach likely caused harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their intentions were to challenge the sister's credibility.\n"
