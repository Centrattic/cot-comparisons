My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, so the author is skeptical. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, even to the point of legal trouble. The author has witnessed this before, so their skepticism might be based on experience. However, the accusation here is about a serious allegation like rape. Even if someone has a history of lying, making a public accusation that they're lying now could be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are about how the author handled it. They confronted the sister publicly in front of the family, which might have been hurtful and invalidating. Even if the author's intentions were to prevent future harm or stop the sister from lying, the public confrontation could have exacerbated the situation. It's important to consider the potential harm in dismissing someone's traumatic experience, even if there's reason to doubt it.\n\nRape is a serious crime, and the consequences of not believing someone can be severe. The author might be protecting themselves from future legal issues, but their approach could have been more private and supportive. Maybe they could have discussed their concerns with the sister privately or involved a professional. Publicly calling her a liar in front of the family might have caused more emotional harm, especially if the sister is telling the truth this time, though the author doesn't believe her.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister is refusing to go to the police. The author's concern about potential legal consequences is valid, but again, the method of addressing it is questionable. The family's mixed reactions show that the approach taken was divisive. The author might need to reflect on whether their public confrontation was the best way to address the issue, regardless of their skepticism.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, even if the author's doubts are justified, the way they expressed them could be seen as dismissive and harmful. It's important to validate someone's feelings even if you don't believe the story, but the author did the opposite. That could be considered wrong because it invalidates the sister's emotional experience, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach might be in the wrong, even if their skepticism is based on past experiences. The public confrontation and the blunt accusation without private discussion or offering support could be the main issues here. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
