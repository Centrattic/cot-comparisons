My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The situation is complex because the sister has a history of lying, but rape is a serious and sensitive issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of lying\u2014legal issues, lawsuits, changing stories. The author believes she's lying again here, pointing out inconsistencies in her story and her refusal to report to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author's past experiences with the sister's lies might make them skeptical. They might think they're protecting the family from another false claim. But on the other hand, accusing someone of lying about rape is extremely serious. Rape is a traumatic experience, and even if there's a history of lying, it's crucial not to dismiss someone's claim without proper evidence. Publicly confronting her in front of the family could have worsened the situation, causing emotional harm regardless of the truth.\n\nThe sister's refusal to go to the police is a red flag, but that alone doesn't prove she's lying. Some victims might not report due to fear, shame, or other reasons. The author's approach was confrontational and public, which might have been unproductive and hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's intent was to call out the sister's lies, but the method\u2014publicly accusing her without evidence\u2014could be seen as dismissive and damaging. Even if the sister has lied before, each situation is different. The author didn't seek to support or help, just to accuse. This could prevent the sister from seeking real help if she were a victim.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to balance belief in victims with critical thinking. However, the author didn't provide support or suggest alternatives like encouraging the sister to contact authorities or seek counseling. Instead, they publicly denounced her, which can be harmful regardless of the truth. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it sensitively, even if their suspicions are based on past behavior.\n"
