My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has a history of lying. She's been in legal trouble for false police reports and plagiarism, and has sued others for slander and libel. The sister's stories, including this rape claim, are inconsistent with details changing over time. Also, she's not reporting it to the police, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author publicly called her out during a family gathering, which led to tension. The family's reaction is mixed, and the sister is now upset. The author is wondering if they did the right thing by speaking up directly or if they should have handled it differently, like in private.\n\nOn one hand, the sister has a pattern of deception, so the author's suspicion might be based on prior behavior. But on the other hand, the author is publicly accusing her of a serious crime. Even if there's a history of dishonesty, rape is a severe issue and should be taken seriously. Publicly challenging her like that could be harmful, especially if the sister is actually in distress. The author's approach might have been confrontational and invalidated her feelings, which isn't supportive. If the sister is genuine, this could prevent her from getting help. However, the author's concern is valid given the sister's history, and they might fear legal consequences if she continues to lie.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The sister's history of lying, 2) The author's public accusation, and 3) The sister's refusal to report. The author's action could be seen as wrong because they dismissed the claim without proper evidence, even if their intent was to prevent future issues. It's important to handle such sensitive matters with care and not make public accusations without concrete proof, regardless of past behavior. The correct answer is A, as the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of a serious crime based on their own judgment rather than evidence.\n"
