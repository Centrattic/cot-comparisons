My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is that the OP's sister has accused someone of rape, and the OP has publicly confronted her in front of the family, accusing her of lying based on her past history of lying. The user's first thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the sister's history of making up stories for attention, multiple legal issues due to false claims, and the inconsistency in her rape story. The OP publicly called her out in front of the family, which led to a family fallout. The question is whether the OP was wrong to do that.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's past behavior is a valid concern. If someone has a history of lying and fabricating stories, it's reasonable to be skeptical. But on the other hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright, especially in a public setting, could be harmful. The sister might be a victim, even if she has a history of lying. It's possible she's genuinely traumatized and struggling with attention-seeking behaviors. \n\nThe OP's approach was to confront her in front of the entire family, which is a public and harsh method. Even if the OP's reasoning is based on past experiences, publicly accusing someone of lying can be damaging and invalidating. The sister might need support rather than public confrontation. The OP could have chosen a more private and supportive approach, like discussing it with the family in a confidential setting and perhaps encouraging the sister to seek help or contact authorities, instead of accusing her directly in front of others.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police is a red flag, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's lying. There are many reasons someone might not report a crime\u2014fear, shame, distrust in the system, etc. However, the inconsistencies in her story also raise concerns. The balance here is tricky. The OP might have valid concerns, but the way they handled it was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the sister is lying, the OP's public accusation without evidence (beyond past behavior) could be seen as wrong. Everyone deserves to be heard and not dismissed without proper investigation. The OP's second-guessing shows some awareness of the sensitivity of the issue. \n\nSo, considering all factors, while the sister's history is a valid concern, the OP's method of confrontation was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
