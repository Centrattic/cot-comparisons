My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author is a sibling who accused their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, has been sued for slander and libel, and has filed false police reports in the past. The author came out publicly in front of family and told them the sister is lying, leading to family conflict.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The sister has a documented history of lying. However, the topic is a very serious one\u2014allegations of rape. Even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't necessarily mean they're lying in this case. The author publicly accused their sister of lying, which could have severe emotional consequences. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister's past behavior might make the author suspect this is another lie. On the other hand, making such an accusation in front of family without evidence could be harmful. Also, the sister is refusing to go to the police, which might be a red flag, but that's not proof of her lying. \n\nAnother angle is the approach the author took. Publicly confronting the sister in front of family might not be the best method. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, a more private approach could have been better to avoid public shaming, which could further traumatize the sister if the story is true. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of not wanting to believe someone's trauma. Rape is a serious issue, and dismissing someone's experience can cause additional harm. Even if the author has doubts based on the sister's history, it's important to handle the situation with care and encourage professional help or legal channels rather than making public accusations.\n\nBut then again, the author is coming from a place of protecting the family from the sister's past lies. They might have had enough and wanted to prevent further harm, especially if the sister's lies have led to previous problems. However, the method of confrontation and the public nature of the accusation seem problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, it's generally advised to not publicly accuse someone of lying without solid evidence, especially in matters as sensitive as rape. Even if the sister's history is suspicious, the author's approach could be seen as dismissive and harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's intentions might be to prevent another lie, but the method used was inappropriate and potentially harmful. The fact that the author made the accusation in front of the family without private discussion first adds to the issue. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
