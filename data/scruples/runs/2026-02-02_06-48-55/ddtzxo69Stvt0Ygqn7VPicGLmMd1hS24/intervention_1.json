My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has a history of lying, even being sued and charged for false reports. She makes up stories for attention, and this time she's claiming rape with inconsistent details. The author confronts her in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's past behavior. The sister's history of lying might make the author skeptical. However, accusing someone of a serious crime like rape, especially in a public family setting, can be very damaging. Rape is a sensitive issue, and dismissing someone's claim, even with skepticism, can retraumatize them. \n\nBut the sister's pattern of lies is significant. The author isn't just reacting to a one-time claim but has a history of the sister making up stories. The author might be trying to prevent her sister from causing more harm or getting into legal trouble. However, the way the author handled it\u2014publicly confronting her in front of family\u2014could be seen as harsh and potentially invalidating if the sister is telling the truth this time.\n\nThere's also the question of due process. Even if the sister has lied before, each claim should be taken seriously. The author's public accusation might be seen as a violation of the sister's privacy and dignity. But if the sister is indeed lying again, the author is trying to protect the family from being manipulated.\n\nI need to consider the balance between protecting the family from lies and respecting the sister's dignity. Also, the potential consequences if the sister is actually telling the truth. The author's approach might prevent the sister from seeking help if it's a real trauma.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are to stop the sister's lies, but the method was public shaming, which is problematic. Even if the sister is lying, the way the author handled it could be considered wrong. The correct approach might have been to discuss privately, support if it's true, or seek professional help. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it publicly without supporting evidence.\n\nBut the sister's history complicates things. If the author is right, then the sister might avoid legal trouble. However, the public confrontation is still a breach of trust and could be harmful. The answer hinges on whether the method of confrontation was appropriate, regardless of the justification.\n"
