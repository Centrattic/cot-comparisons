My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her potential rape claim, given her history of lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. The author mentions that the sister is a compulsive liar with a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from false reports. The sister's current story has inconsistencies in details, like the number of attackers and the timeline. The author is concerned about her pattern of lying and wants to prevent her from causing more harm.\n\nBut then, the topic is a serious one\u2014alleged rape. It's a traumatic experience, and even if there's a history of lying, the claim still needs to be taken seriously. The author's approach was to publicly accuse her sister of lying in front of the family, which might have caused further emotional distress. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The sister's history of lying.\n2. The author's public confrontation.\n3. The sensitivity of the topic.\n4. The sister's refusal to report to the police.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent their sister from getting into more trouble by exposing the inconsistencies. On the other hand, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue can be harmful and may discourage her from seeking help if the claim is real. The author's method might have been harsh, but their intent could be to stop the sister's behavior. \n\nHowever, even with the sister's past, the author didn't present evidence, just their own judgment. Publicly shaming her might have been unwise. The author should have considered a more private and supportive approach, maybe involving authorities if they were concerned about her making false claims. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they publicly accused their sister without evidence, which could invalidate her if she's telling the truth now. But if the sister's history is strong enough, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way they handled it\u2014public confrontation without evidence\u2014could be problematic regardless of the sister's history.\n"
