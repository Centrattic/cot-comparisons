My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for publicly calling their sister a liar about a rape claim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories for attention, including legal troubles from false reports. The brother is questioning her latest claim because her story keeps changing, and she's not contacting the police. He confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the key points here are the sister's history and the brother's approach. On one hand, the brother has valid concerns given her past behavior. But rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright, even with skepticism, can be harmful. The brother's public confrontation might have invalidated her feelings and caused further trauma, especially if she was being truthful this time. Even if she's lying, the way he addressed it in front of the family could be seen as cruel and dismissive, adding to her emotional distress.\n\nHowever, the sister's pattern of deceit is significant. The brother might feel justified in his skepticism given her history. But the problem is that his response was public and confrontational, which might not be the healthiest approach. The right approach might have been to express his concerns privately, perhaps suggesting she seek support or report it, while still being cautious about the inconsistencies.\n\nSo, the brother's intentions might be to prevent her from causing more harm, but his method was public shaming, which is problematic. Even if he's right or wrong about her lying, the way he handled it is questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of how he publicly accused her without giving her privacy or support.\n"
