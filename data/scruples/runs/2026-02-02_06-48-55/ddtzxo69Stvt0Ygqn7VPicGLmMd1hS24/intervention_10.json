My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister accusing someone of rape, and the author doesn't believe her, calling her out in front of the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is described as a compulsive liar with a history of legal problems from making false claims. The author mentions past incidents where she lied about knife attacks and plagiarism, leading to lawsuits and college expulsion. The current rape accusation has inconsistent details over time, and she's not reporting it to the police. The author confronted her publicly, which caused a family fallout.\n\nBut the key point here is the topic: rape. Even if the sister has a history of lying, accusing someone of a serious crime like rape is extremely sensitive. Publicly accusing her of lying could have serious consequences. Rape is underreported, and victims often face disbelief or stigma. However, if there's a pattern of false accusations, that complicates things.\n\nThe author's approach was to call her out in front of the entire family. Even if his intentions were to prevent her from lying again, doing so in a public setting (family gathering) might be unkind and escalate the situation. He should have perhaps addressed it privately first, maybe involved authorities or a counselor to handle it appropriately. Public confrontation could make her feel shamed or retaliated against, and it's possible she might take legal action for defamation, especially if the accusation is true. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is indeed lying, the author is trying to protect the family from her manipulative behavior. But the problem is, without concrete evidence, making such a public accusation is risky. It's important to take any rape claim seriously, regardless of the person's history. Even if they are a habitual liar, the author should not dismiss the claim outright without proper investigation. It's possible she genuinely experienced trauma and is expressing it through lies, or maybe this time is different. \n\nThe author's response was to accuse her in front of everyone, which is not only hurtful but could prevent her from coming forward in the future if it's true. Also, the article mentions she's not going to the police, which is concerning. The author might have acted out of frustration but in a way that's unhelpful and potentially harmful. The best approach would be to support her and encourage her to seek help while also being cautious about her history. However, the author's public confrontation seems to have crossed a line, regardless of the sister's past. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
