My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's sister made a claim of being raped, and the author publicly called her out in front of the family, saying they think she's lying. The sister has a history of lying, even being sued for slander and making false police reports. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a big deal. Even if the sister has lied before, the author is making a public accusation that could damage the sister's reputation and relationships. The sister's well-being is crucial here, and the author's public confrontation might have caused emotional harm, especially if the sister is genuinely in distress.\n\nBut the author also has a valid concern about the sister's history. However, past behavior doesn't necessarily prove current lying. The author might be projecting past patterns onto this new situation. Even if the sister has lied before, each situation is different. The author's approach was to address it in front of the family, which could be seen as harsh and dismissive, especially in a sensitive matter like rape.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility to support someone who might be a victim. Even if the author suspects a lie, the appropriate response might be to encourage the sister to seek help or talk to authorities rather than publicly calling her out. The sister might be in need of support regardless of the truth, and the author's public accusation might prevent her from getting that help if she's telling the truth.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of confronting the sister\u2014publicly and confrontationally\u2014could be counterproductive. It might make the sister less likely to open up or trust anyone, even if she's being truthful. The author mentions that the sister refuses to go to the police, which is another red flag, but the author's approach might not be helping either.\n\nConsidering all this, even if the sister is lying, the author's public accusation without supporting evidence or a more private, supportive approach could be seen as wrong. The author has a responsibility to handle the situation with care, respecting the seriousness of the accusation and the potential trauma involved. The right approach might be to express concerns privately, suggest professional help, and avoid public shaming, which can have lasting negative effects regardless of the truth.\n"
