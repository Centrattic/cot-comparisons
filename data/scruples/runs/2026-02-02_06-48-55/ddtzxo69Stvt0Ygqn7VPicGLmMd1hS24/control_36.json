My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister they don't believe her rape claim. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues like filing false police reports and being sued for slander and libel. The author points out inconsistencies in her story about the rape\u2014like the number of perpetrators and the timeline\u2014and her refusal to report it to the police. The author confronted her publicly in front of the family, which caused a fallout.\n\nThe key points to consider are: \n1. The sister's history of lying and attention-seeking behavior.\n2. The inconsistencies in her current story.\n3. The author's public confrontation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their sister's pattern of deceit and the potential consequences of a false rape accusation. They might believe they're protecting the family from being manipulated again. Also, the author mentions they're open to apologizing if there's evidence, which shows they're not dismissing the possibility outright.\n\nOn the other hand, accusing someone of lying about a serious allegation like rape is a significant accusation. Even with past behavior, it's a sensitive issue. Publicly confronting her in front of family could be seen as shaming and might prevent her from seeking help if the claim is genuine. The author's approach might have been harsh and public, which could exacerbate the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's refusal to go to the police. If she's truly a victim, there could be reasons for not reporting\u2014fear, trauma, etc. The author's assumption that she's lying again might overlook these factors. However, the sister's history complicates that, as previous lies have had legal repercussions.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's intent was to stop their sister's lies, but the method of confrontation and public accusation might be problematic. Even if the sister is lying, the approach taken could be disrespectful and harmful, especially in a family setting. It's possible the author could have handled it differently, like expressing concerns privately first or supporting her in seeking help instead of publicly accusing her.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns based on their sister's history, the way they addressed it in public and the assumption of lying without evidence could be seen as wrong. The balance between protecting the family from manipulation and respecting the sister's potential trauma is tricky. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the public confrontation and the serious nature of the accusation.\n"
