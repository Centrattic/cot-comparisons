My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of being a compulsive liar, with multiple lawsuits (slander, libel) and even a false police report. Her stories have changed over time, like the number of attackers and the timeline. The author confronted her in front of the family, saying she's lying and that this is the same pattern as before. The family reacted with some agreeing and others not, and now the sister won't look at them.\n\nFirst, I have to consider the key points here. The sister has a documented history of lying, which has led to legal consequences. However, the author is publicly accusing her of lying about a serious allegation like rape. That's a big deal. Even if the sister has lied before, rape is a traumatic event, and the author's public confrontation might have caused further harm. \n\nThe author might be right that the sister is lying, but the way they handled it\u2014publicly calling her out in front of family\u2014could be inappropriate. It's important to validate someone's feelings and not immediately dismiss their trauma, even if they have a history of lies. The sister might genuinely be in distress, and the author's response could be invalidating and damaging. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the sister refused to go to the police, which is a red flag. But does that mean she's lying, or could there be other reasons? Maybe fear, shame, or trauma is preventing her from reporting. The author is assuming malice, but without evidence, that's a problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the information given, it's hard to know the truth of the rape claim. However, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter, especially in front of others and without approaching it privately first, is likely to be seen as harmful. The sister's history is relevant, but the author's method of confrontation might not be the right approach. They should have perhaps addressed it privately, supported the sister, and encouraged her to seek help if needed, instead of making a public accusation. \n\nSo, even if the author's suspicions are correct, the way they handled the situation is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they publicly invalidated a serious claim without proper process, which is considered harmful.\n"
