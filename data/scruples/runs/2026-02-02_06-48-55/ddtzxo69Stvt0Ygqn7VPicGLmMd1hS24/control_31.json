My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The author has a history of their sister making false claims, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The sister has a documented history of lying\u2014legal issues, lawsuits, and fabricated stories. The author is concerned that this latest claim about rape might be another lie, given the inconsistencies in her story and the pattern of behavior. However, accusing someone of lying about a traumatic experience like rape is extremely sensitive. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The sister's history of dishonesty.\n2. The author's public confrontation in front of the family.\n3. The sensitivity of the topic\u2014rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it can have severe consequences.\n\nWhile the author might believe their sister is lying, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly calling her out in front of family\u2014could be seen as dismissive and harmful. Even if the sister has a history of lying, making such an accusation without evidence can invalidate her experience. It's possible that the sister is telling the truth, and the author's public confrontation might discourage her from coming forward or seeking help if it's real.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't present any evidence to support their claim, just their opinion based on the sister's past behavior. The sister is not going to the police, which is her right, but the author is pushing for that. However, the sister's reluctance might be due to fear of not being believed or other reasons, which the author isn't considering.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author's approach caused a family rift, with some agreeing and others not. The sister now refuses to look at them, which is a significant consequence. \n\nConsidering all this, even if the author's suspicion is based on facts, the way they handled it was inappropriate. It's crucial to take rape allegations seriously, regardless of the person's history. The correct approach might be to support the sister in getting help, report the incident to authorities if there's evidence, or advise her to seek legal or medical attention without publicly accusing her of lying. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about such a serious matter without evidence and in a way that caused harm.\n"
