My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is questioning whether their sister is lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from making up stories. The author confronted the sister in front of the family, stating they don't believe her and pointing out inconsistencies in her story. The family is now divided, and the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The sister has a documented history of lying, which might make the author more skeptical. However, rape is a serious accusation and a traumatic experience. Even if the sister has lied before, that doesn't automatically mean she's lying this time. The author's approach of publicly confronting her might have been harsh, especially in front of the family, which could have exacerbated the situation.\n\nBut the sister's refusal to go to the police and the changing details do raise some red flags. The author might have had reasons to be cautious. However, accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can be damaging, both emotionally and socially. It's possible the author's intentions were to prevent the sister from getting into legal trouble again, but the method of addressing it in front of everyone might have been inappropriate.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. Publicly accusing someone of lying about a rape can lead to further trauma and may discourage the person from seeking help if it's true. On the other hand, if the sister is lying, the author might be trying to protect the family from being manipulated again. The key here is the balance between skepticism based on history and respecting the sister's potential need for support if the claim is genuine.\n\nThe author's second-guessing themselves is a positive sign, showing they're aware that they might have acted hastily. But the initial action of confronting her in front of the family without a private discussion first could be seen as wrong, regardless of their reasoning. It's important to approach sensitive issues with care and without public accusation, especially when the claim is about a serious crime.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's history of lying is a factor, the author's public confrontation might have been the wrong approach, even if their intentions were to prevent further lies. The correct approach might have been to discuss privately or involve a professional to handle the situation more appropriately.\n"
