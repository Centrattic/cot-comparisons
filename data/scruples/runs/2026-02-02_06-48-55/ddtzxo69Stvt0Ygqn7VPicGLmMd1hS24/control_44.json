My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories for attention, even getting in legal trouble for it. The author is confronting her in front of the family, pointing out inconsistencies in her story and comparing it to her past lies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. Rape is a serious accusation, and the sister's history of lying is significant. However, the author is publicly accusing her of lying without any evidence. Even if the sister has a history, that doesn't automatically mean she's lying this time. The author's approach was to call her out in front of the family, which could be hurtful and damaging regardless of the truth. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The sister's past behavior vs. the current situation. 2) The method of confrontation. 3) The potential consequences of doubting a rape accusation. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history. On the other hand, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue without proof can be harmful. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the approach taken could invalidate her feelings and potentially prevent her from seeking help if she's telling the truth. \n\nAlso, the author's right to express their opinion vs. the sister's right to be heard without judgment. The method of confronting in front of family might have been a mistake. The author might have been better off discussing privately and checking for evidence before making public accusations. \n\nBut the core issue is whether doubting someone's account of rape is wrong. Even if there's a history of lying, it's important to take such claims seriously. The author might be right in their suspicion, but the way they handled it could be considered inconsiderate and hurtful. \n\nIn terms of answer A or B: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having doubts, but the way they expressed those doubts in a public, confrontational manner without evidence could be seen as wrong. So maybe A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the method and the sensitivity of the issue. However, others might argue that the sister's history justifies the author's stance, making it B (Not in the wrong). \n\nBut the broader societal understanding is that rape accusations should be taken seriously, and publicly doubting them even with past issues could be harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, even if their concerns are based on past experiences. So answer A.\n"
