My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author's sister is accusing someone of rape, but the author doesn't believe her and confronts her in front of the family. The sister has a history of lying, even being sued for slander and libel, and making up stories that led to legal trouble. The author points out inconsistencies in her story and accuses her of lying again. The family is divided, and the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the author has a valid reason to be skeptical because the sister has a pattern of lying. But on the other hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing it outright could be harmful. Even if the sister is a compulsive liar, the author shouldn't assume she's lying this time without evidence. The author might be hurting their sister and damaging family relationships by confronting her publicly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister refuses to report to the police. That's concerning because not reporting could be due to fear, trauma, or other reasons, not just lying. The author's approach was to accuse her in front of family, which might not be the best way to handle it. A better approach might be to express concern privately, encourage her to seek help, or involve a professional counselor or therapist.\n\nThe author's actions led to family conflict and the sister cutting them off. Even if the author's skepticism is based on past experiences, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive topic is likely to cause harm. The author should have taken a more supportive and less confrontational approach, maybe suggesting professional help or discussing their concerns privately rather than in front of others.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intentions might be rooted in past experiences, but the method of confrontation is inappropriate. Dismissing a rape allegation without thorough investigation is problematic, regardless of the sister's history. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they handled the situation.\n"
