My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their sister and accusing her of lying about being raped. The key points here are the sister's history of lying, the author's public accusation, and the sensitivity of the topic.\n\nFirst, the sister has a documented history of making false claims, including legal consequences. The author knows this and is concerned about her tendency to fabricate stories for attention. However, the sister is now making a serious allegation of rape, which is a traumatic and sensitive issue. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction is to publicly accuse her of lying in front of the family. Even if the sister has lied before, the context of a rape accusation is different. Publicly denouncing someone for such a serious crime, even with prior history, could be seen as dismissive and harmful. It might invalidate her experience and discourage her from seeking help if it's true. \n\nThe author's approach was confrontational and done in front of the entire family, which could be more damaging than if they had addressed it privately. The sister's changing story and refusal to report to the police add to the suspicion, but the author's public accusation might hinder any chance of her getting the support she needs if the accusation is genuine. \n\nEven if the author's intentions were to prevent further lies or legal trouble, the method of addressing it in a public setting without giving the sister a chance to explain or seek help might be considered wrong. It's important to consider the potential harm of such a public accusation, regardless of the sister's past behavior. \n\nSo, while the sister's history is a factor, the way the author chose to confront the situation could be seen as inappropriate. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public nature of the accusation and the sensitivity of the issue, despite the sister's past.\n"
