My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her alleged rape, given the sister's history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of making up stories for attention, leading to legal consequences. The author believes she's lying again here, pointing out inconsistencies in her story and her refusal to report to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect. Accusing someone of lying about a rape is a serious matter. Rapememoirs and accusations are sensitive, and even if someone has a history of lying, it's possible they're telling the truth this time. The author's approach was public and confrontational, which could be seen as dismissive and harmful. Public shaming might discourage the sister from seeking help or reporting the crime if it's legitimate.\n\nHowever, the sister's history is significant. The author has evidence of past lies. But even with that history, assuming she's lying without evidence could be wrong. The author's actions might invalidate her experience, regardless of the truth. The key here is whether the method of confrontation was appropriate. Publicly calling her out without supporting evidence might be wrong, especially in a family setting where emotions are high.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the sister's changing stories and refusal to file a report. These are red flags, but they don't definitively prove a lie. The author's approach could be seen as lacking empathy and understanding, which is crucial in such sensitive situations.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered private communication first, maybe discussing with the sister individually or consulting professionals. Public confrontation might have caused more harm. Even if the author is correct about the sister lying, the manner of addressing it was inappropriate.\n\nSo, taking all this into account, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. The main issue is the public and confrontational method used, regardless of the sister's potential dishonesty. The author's actions could have caused significant emotional harm and potentially covered up a real issue if the sister was telling the truth. The right approach would have been to handle it privately, with more empathy and support, perhaps involving authorities or counselors.\n"
