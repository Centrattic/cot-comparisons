My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The author's sister made a rape allegation, and the author publicly accused her of lying in front of the family. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from making false claims.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Rape is a serious accusation, and making false allegations is a crime. However, the author's public accusation of their sister could have serious consequences, both emotionally and legally. Even if the sister has a history of lying, the author's response might be seen as dismissive of a potential serious crime.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The sister has a documented history of lying, including legal troubles. 2) The author confronted her publicly in front of family, which could be seen as shaming or invalidating. 3) The author is now doubting their actions but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their family from potential false claims, based on the sister's past. On the other hand, the author's public accusation could harm the sister's credibility if she was telling the truth. However, the sister's refusal to report to the police and changing stories might support the author's skepticism.\n\nBut even with all that, making a public accusation without evidence can be harmful. The author could have discussed this privately with family first or encouraged the sister to report the rape. Publicly shaming her might prevent her from seeking real help if the accusation was genuine. However, given the sister's history, the author might believe it's a false report.\n\nI think the answer here is nuanced. While the author's intent was to prevent a false accusation, their method was inappropriate. Public confrontation without supporting evidence might be considered wrong, as it could damage relationships and potentially cover up a real incident if the sister was telling the truth. So the author might be in the wrong (Answer A), but there's context. However, some might argue the sister's history justifies the author's actions (Answer B). But in most cases, public accusation without proper channels is problematic.\n"
