My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories, but rape is a serious accusation. I need to consider both perspectives here.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: their sister has a history of lying, and the story details keep changing. The author felt compelled to confront her in front of the family. They might think they're protecting the family from more lies. But rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claims can be harmful, right? Even if there's a pattern of lying, accusing someone of lying about such a sensitive issue can be damaging. It might invalidate their feelings if they're telling the truth, or make them reluctant to seek help.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past behavior is concerning. She's been in legal trouble for false reports. The author might be trying to address this pattern. However, the way they did it\u2014publicly confronting her in front of the family\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible that the author should have handled it more privately, perhaps by involving authorities or a counselor instead of making a public accusation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that rape is a serious topic and takes it seriously, but their approach might be counterproductive. Even if the sister is lying, the author's public accusation could escalate tensions and hurt family relationships. There's also the risk that if the sister is telling the truth, the author's response could prevent her from getting the support she needs.\n\nI need to weigh the sister's history against the seriousness of the accusation. While the sister's past is troubling, the subject of rape is extremely sensitive. The author's public confrontation might have done more harm than good, regardless of the sister's truthfulness. The appropriate action might be to encourage the sister to report the incident through proper channels if she's telling the truth, while also addressing the lying history with the family or professionals. The author's direct accusation in front of everyone might have been the wrong approach. So, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong for how they handled the situation publicly and directly, even if their concerns are valid.\n"
