My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author publicly called out their sister for lying about being raped, based on her history of compulsive lying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. The author is skeptical because the story keeps changing and she's not reporting it to the police. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here is tricky. On one hand, the sister's past behavior raises red flags. The author might be trying to prevent her from causing more harm, especially if the sister's lies have led to legal problems before. The author's intention could be to stop her from making false accusations.\n\nOn the other hand, the topic of rape is extremely sensitive. Even if there's a history of lying, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can be damaging. The sister might genuinely be a victim this time, and the author's public denial could prevent her from getting support or justice. Also, the author didn't go to the police, which is the proper channel, instead of addressing it within the family.\n\nAnother point is the method of confronting the sister. Doing it in front of the family might have been harsh and could have invalidated her feelings, especially if she was a victim. The sister's emotional state is mentioned, with her crying and being upset. The author's approach might have been too confrontational without considering the sister's perspective.\n\nHowever, the author's concern that the sister is lying again isn't unfounded. The sister's history includes serious lies, so the author's skepticism isn't baseless. But the problem is how to address it appropriately. Maybe the author should have discussed privately with the sister and possibly involved authorities if there was evidence of lies, rather than making a public accusation.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, the author isn't in a position to determine the truth of the rape allegation. That's what law enforcement and legal processes are for. The author's public accusation could lead to legal repercussions if the sister is indeed telling the truth. Also, the author's comment about the sister getting jail time is concerning. It's not the author's role to threaten legal action but to report to proper authorities if there's reason to believe the claim is false.\n\nThe sister's refusal to report to the police could be due to fear, trauma, or other reasons, not just lying. The author is assuming the sister is lying without evidence, which is a serious assumption. Even with a history of lying, each situation should be considered on its own merits.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns based on past experiences, the public accusation and the way it was handled are problematic. The author should have approached the situation with more sensitivity, possibly involving appropriate authorities rather than making a public confrontation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the manner in which they addressed the issue, regardless of their intentions.\n"
