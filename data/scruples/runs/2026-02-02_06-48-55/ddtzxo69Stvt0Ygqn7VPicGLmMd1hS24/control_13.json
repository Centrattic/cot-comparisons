My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their sister about potentially lying about being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister has a history of lying, which includes legal issues like false police reports and being sued for slander and libel. She's described as a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. The author is skeptical of her latest claim, pointing out inconsistencies in her story and her refusal to report it to the police. \n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their sister's pattern of deception and is trying to protect the family from being manipulated. They might believe that by speaking up, they're preventing her from getting into legal trouble again. But on the other hand, the topic of rape is extremely sensitive. Accusing someone of lying about such a serious matter can be harmful. Even if the sister has lied before, making a public accusation about a rape accusation could be seen as dismissing her trauma and potentially retraumatizing her. \n\nThe author did confront the sister during a family gathering, which might have been unwise. Public confrontation can lead to embarrassment and defensiveness, making it harder for the sister to process or address her experiences if they are real. Also, the author didn't report the concern to authorities or seek professional advice before making their accusation, which could be a problem. \n\nIt's important to remember that even if someone has a history of lying, it doesn't automatically mean they're lying in this specific case. The author's approach of publicly confronting her without considering other avenues (like encouraging her to seek help or involving a counselor) might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, accusing someone of lying about rape can have severe consequences, whether true or not. It might prevent her from getting the support she needs if the experience is real. The author's intention was to address the sister's lies, but the method used could be considered harmful regardless of their intentions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they publicly accused their sister without ensuring the situation was handled with the necessary sensitivity and support, potentially dismissing her potential trauma and damaging family relationships.\n"
