My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author publicly confronting their sister, who claims to have been raped, but the author believes she's lying based on her history of compulsive lying and inconsistencies in her story.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a documented history of lying, including legal issues and previous false accusations. The author is part of a family that's been dealing with these lies for years. The sister's latest claim about being raped has inconsistent details over time, and she's not reporting it to the police. The author confronts her in front of the whole family, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing someone's trauma can be harmful. Even if there's suspicion, publicly calling someone a liar might invalidate their experience and discourage them from seeking help. There's also the risk of causing emotional harm and straining family relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a history of lying, and the author might be trying to protect the family from more lies or prevent the sister from getting into legal trouble. The author's intention could be to stop the sister from continuing her pattern of deceit. However, the approach taken\u2014public confrontation and accusations\u2014might not be the best way to handle the situation.\n\nI need to weigh the potential harm of the author's actions. Publicly accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape can be damaging, even if the accuser has doubts. It might make the sister feel disbelieved and isolated, which is a real issue in cases of sexual assault. But the sister's history complicates things. However, regardless of past behavior, each claim should be taken seriously. Past behavior doesn't automatically invalidate current claims. People can change, or there might be genuine trauma mixed with past issues.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. If the intention is to protect the sister from herself (since she might face legal consequences if her story is found to be false), that's a valid concern. But the method of addressing it by making a public accusation without giving her the opportunity to address the inconsistencies privately might be the problem.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author's suspicion is justified, the way they handled it could be considered wrong. The appropriate approach might have been to express concerns privately, maybe support her in seeking professional help, or involve authorities if there's evidence of her lying. Publicly accusing her in front of the family could have been seen as a harsh and public shaming, which might not be the right way to handle a sensitive issue, even if there are valid doubts.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's public confrontation and accusation, despite valid concerns, might be seen as wrong because it's done in a way that's public and accusatory without giving the sister a chance to explain herself in private. The sister's history is a factor, but the method of addressing the issue is questionable. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
