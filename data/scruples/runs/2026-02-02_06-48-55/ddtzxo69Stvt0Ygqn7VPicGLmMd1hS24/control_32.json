My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the author confronted their sister in front of the family, accusing her of lying about being raped. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including some that led to legal issues. The author's stance is that despite the sensitivity of the topic, the sister's pattern of lying makes them skeptical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The author is questioning whether they were right to publicly accuse their sister of lying without perhaps giving her more of a chance to explain. Rape is a serious accusation, and the consequences of false claims can be significant. However, the sister's history of lying is a major factor here. The author mentions that the sister has been sued multiple times and even filed false police reports. So there's a valid reason for the author's skepticism.\n\nBut then there's the approach they took. Publicly shaming or accusing someone of lying, especially about such a traumatic experience, can be hurtful and may discourage the person from seeking help. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the method of confronting her in front of the family might have been inappropriate. The sister's refusal to report to the police could be for various reasons\u2014fear, shame, or maybe she's not sure herself. The author dismisses her story without giving her the benefit of the doubt, which might not be the best approach even if they're concerned about her past behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's history of lying is a red flag. The author isn't just randomly accusing her; they have specific examples of past deceptions. However, the problem is that even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean they're lying in this case. The author might be projecting their past experiences onto this situation, which could lead to a missed opportunity to support a genuine victim if the sister is telling the truth this time.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sister's history of lying, the author's public confrontation, and the potential consequences of both actions. The author might have been right to be skeptical but wrong in how they addressed it. The situation is complex because it's about balancing the sister's credibility against the author's concern for the family's well-being and the sister's past behavior. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to support a family member who claims to be a victim of a serious crime, even if there are doubts. The author could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by discussing it privately, encouraging the sister to report it to authorities, or seeking professional help. Publicly accusing her without evidence might have been hasty and damaging, regardless of their intentions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their skepticism is somewhat justified. The approach of public confrontation without allowing for a more private and supportive conversation could be seen as inappropriate.\n"
