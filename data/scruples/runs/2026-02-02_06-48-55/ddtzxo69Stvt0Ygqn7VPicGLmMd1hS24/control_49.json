My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about possibly lying about being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues from false reports. The author is expressing their suspicion that the sister is lying again, given the inconsistencies in the story and the sister's past behavior. The author did this in front of the entire family, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Belief in the sister's truthfulness**: The sister is making a serious allegation. Rape is a severe crime, and such accusations carry significant weight. Even if the sister has lied before, each case is unique. The author's public accusation might be seen as dismissing the sister's trauma, whether true or not. \n\n2. **Public confrontation**: The author addressed the sister in front of the whole family. This could be hurtful and might have compounded the sister's distress. Public shaming, even with intent to expose lies, can be damaging regardless of the truth.\n\n3. **Impact on the sister**: If the sister is telling the truth, the author's response could discourage her from seeking help. If false, it might stop her from continuing to lie, but the method of confrontation is questionable.\n\n4. **Due process and empathy**: Even if there's a history of lying, the author is making a judgment without evidence. The sister might be in a vulnerable state if the rape actually happened. The author's approach might lack the sensitivity needed in such a situation.\n\n5. **Legal implications**: The sister is not reporting the rape, which is concerning. If the author's intervention was to prevent a false report, that's a valid point, but the method of public confrontation might not be the best way.\n\nBalancing these factors: The sister's past behavior gives the author some grounds for suspicion, but the author's public accusation could be seen as invalidating the sister's experience, whether true or not. The approach might have been harsh and could have been handled more privately to protect the sister's dignity, whether she's lying or truthful.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, not necessarily the suspicion itself. They should consider the potential harm in their approach versus the sister's potential truthfulness. The method and public nature of the confrontation are problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
