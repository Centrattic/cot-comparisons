My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister has made a claim of being raped, but the author accuses her of lying, citing her history of compulsive lying and inconsistent stories. The author confronted the sister in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The sister has a documented history of making up stories, including legal issues and previous false reports. However, the topic of rape is extremely sensitive and serious. Accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event can have severe consequences, both for the accuser and the accused.\n\nThe author's actions involved publicly confronting the sister in front of the family and dismissing her claim based on past behavior. Even if the sister has lied before, there's a risk that a real assault could be overlooked. The author's approach might have invalidated the sister's feelings, even if the sister is lying. It's important to handle such situations with care, given the trauma involved in sexual assault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be concerned about the sister's pattern of behavior and the potential for legal repercussions if the story is false. The author might feel that supporting the sister's claim without verifying it could enable further lies. However, the public confrontation and blunt dismissal could be seen as harmful, especially if the sister is genuinely a victim.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting against false claims and supporting victims. The author's approach might not be the most constructive. It's possible that a better approach would be to encourage the sister to seek help or to report the incident through proper channels, rather than publicly accusing her of lying. The author's actions could be seen as invalidating the sister's experience, regardless of the truth, which could cause additional harm.\n\nI should also consider the societal context. There's a stigma around being a victim of sexual assault, and false accusations are rare. However, the sister's history complicates things. The author might be trying to prevent a false report, but the method of public confrontation is problematic. It's important to handle these situations with sensitivity and to encourage professional support rather than public judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the sister's history, the way they addressed the situation\u2014publicly accusing her of lying\u2014could be considered wrong. It's important to approach such sensitive issues with care and to support the victim without public confrontation, even if one suspects the claim is false.\n"
