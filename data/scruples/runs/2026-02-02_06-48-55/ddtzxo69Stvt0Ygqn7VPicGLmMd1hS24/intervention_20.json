My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accused their sister of lying about being raped in front of the family. The sister has a history of lying, which the author mentions in detail. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from an ethical and emotional standpoint. The sister has a history of making up stories for attention, which includes legal consequences. The author is trying to protect their family from being manipulated again, but the accusation is about a serious crime\u2014rape. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid concern given the sister's past behavior. It's understandable that they're skeptical. However, publicly accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event is a serious matter. Rape is a sensitive issue, and dismissing someone's claims can have severe emotional consequences. Even if the author believes the sister is lying, the way they handled it\u2014publicly confronting her in front of the family\u2014might have been hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nThe author mentions that the sister changes details and refuses to go to the police. This could indicate a pattern, but it's also possible that the sister is struggling with trauma, which can affect memory and willingness to report. The author didn't offer support or encourage the sister to seek help, which is important regardless of the truth. \n\nPublicly shaming someone for a serious accusation like this can damage relationships and may prevent the sister from getting the help she needs if the claim is legitimate. Even if the author is right about the sister being a compulsive liar, the approach taken might have been unkind and harsh, especially without giving the sister a chance to address the situation privately or seeking professional advice.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect the family from being deceived, but the method used might have caused more harm. The correct approach might have been to talk to the sister privately, express concerns, and perhaps suggest professional help rather than making a public accusation. So, while the author's skepticism is based on past experiences, the way they handled the situation is questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they confronted the sister.\n"
