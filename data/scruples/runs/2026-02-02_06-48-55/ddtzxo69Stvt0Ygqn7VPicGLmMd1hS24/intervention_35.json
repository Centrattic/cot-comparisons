My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of lying, including legal issues and past incidents where her stories were proven false. The author is frustrated and has confronted the sister in front of the family, which caused a rift.\n\nBut here's the tricky part: even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't necessarily mean they're lying now. Rape is a serious accusation, and dismissing someone's trauma can be harmful. The author might believe their sister is lying, but accusing someone of being a liar in front of family and in a public manner (like an AITA post) could be seen as invalidating her experience, regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the author didn't go to the police or take steps to verify the sister's claim. Instead, they publicly called her out, which could prevent the sister from seeking help if she were telling the truth. Even if the sister has a pattern of lying, the author's approach might be seen as harsh and not supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns based on past behavior. However, the method of confronting the sister in front of family without giving her a chance to explain properly might be the issue. The author should perhaps have handled it privately first or suggested professional help rather than publicly accusing her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key factors are: the seriousness of the accusation, the potential harm of dismissing rape allegations, the public confrontation, and the lack of alternative support offered. Even if the author's intentions were to stop lies, the way they handled it could be considered wrong because it disregards the sister's possible trauma and public shaming isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
