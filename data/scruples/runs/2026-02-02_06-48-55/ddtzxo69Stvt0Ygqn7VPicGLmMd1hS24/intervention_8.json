My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for publicly accusing their sister of lying about being raped. The author's sister has a history of making up stories for attention, including legal issues from previous lies. The sister's latest claim is that she was raped, but the story keeps changing, and she refuses to go to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical implications. Publicly accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape, especially in front of family, can have severe consequences. Even if the sister has a history of dishonesty, the author's public accusation might cause further harm. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim, even with doubts, can prevent them from seeking help and may be seen as a betrayal.\n\nHowever, the author's concerns aren't baseless. The sister's pattern of lying and the inconsistencies in her story are points that the author might genuinely fear could lead to more harm if not addressed. But the way the author handled it\u2014public confrontation in front of the family\u2014could be problematic. It might have invalidated the sister's feelings and made her less likely to come forward truthfully in the future, even if she is being honest this time.\n\nThe key here is balancing the sister's history with the sensitivity of the situation. Even if the author suspects a lie, the approach taken can be seen as dismissive and harmful. The right step would be to encourage the sister to report the incident through proper channels, perhaps with support, while still expressing concerns in a private, non-confrontational manner. Publicly labeling someone a liar, especially about such a sensitive issue, risks causing emotional harm and could prevent the sister from getting the help she might actually need if the claim is true.\n\nSo, while the author might have valid concerns about the sister's past behavior, the method of addressing it was inappropriate. The author is in the wrong for public confrontation and dismissing the sister's claim without proper support or evidence.\n"
