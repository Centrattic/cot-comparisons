My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has a history of being a compulsive liar. She's been in legal trouble for false reports and lawsuits because of her lies. Now, the sister is claiming she was raped, and the author publicly accuses her of lying in front of the family. The sister changes details of the story over time and refuses to report it to the police. The author is now questioning their actions because the family is upset, and the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a big deal. Even if the sister has a history of lying, this is a sensitive issue. The author might be protecting themselves from being taken advantage of, but public confrontation can be damaging. It's possible the author is right to be skeptical, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nRape is a serious accusation, and the legal system has processes in place for verifying such claims. The author's public accusation might prevent the sister from getting the help she needs if it's true, or it could be a valid defense if it's a lie. But the author's approach in front of the family might have caused more harm. The sister might feel isolated, and the family dynamics could be strained further.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police is a red flag. If she's genuinely a victim, there could be reasons she's not reporting\u2014like fear, trauma, or lack of trust. The author might not be considering those factors and is jumping to conclusions based on past behavior. However, given the sister's history, it's possible the author is justified in their skepticism.\n\nBut even so, how the author chose to confront the sister in front of the family without giving her a chance to explain her current situation might be wrong. Public shaming can be hurtful and might not be the best way to address the issue. The author might have acted out of frustration but without considering the consequences for both the sister and the family.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is in a tough spot. They have a history with the sister's lies but are now dealing with a serious allegation. The balance between skepticism and empathy is tricky here. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intentions were to prevent further lies. The public accusation could be seen as dismissive of the sister's potential trauma, regardless of the sister's past behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because they publicly accused the sister without a private discussion first, which could have been more constructive. However, there's also a case for not being in the wrong because of the sister's history. But the public confrontation and not allowing the sister to explain her current situation might be the key issue here.\n"
