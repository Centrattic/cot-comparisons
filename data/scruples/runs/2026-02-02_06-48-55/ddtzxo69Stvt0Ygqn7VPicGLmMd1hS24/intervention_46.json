My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's sister claims she was raped, but the author doesn't believe her and publicly called her out in front of the family. The sister has a history of lying and making up stories for attention, which the author mentions in detail. The author is now second-guessing if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The sister is accusing a serious crime\u2014rape. Even if the sister has a history of lying, making such a claim is extremely sensitive. The author is dismissing her by calling her a liar, which can be traumatic for the victim. Many rape survivors don't report because of not being believed, so the author's public accusation could deter her from seeking help or support if she's telling the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a history with the sister's lies. The sister has a documented pattern of false accusations, which might make the author skeptical. However, even with a history of lying, each situation should be evaluated on its own merits. The author's approach was to confront her publicly without perhaps considering the possibility that this time it's real, even if unlikely.\n\nThe method of confrontation is also an issue. Publicly accusing someone in front of family could be seen as shaming or invalidating, which isn't helpful. The author could have approached it differently, maybe privately, to discuss concerns without causing a public scene. However, the author did mention that the sister's story kept changing, which is a red flag for fabricated stories.\n\nBut even with red flags, the author should be cautious. The sister might be in genuine distress, and the author's response could have lasting negative effects. Even if the sister is lying, the author's approach might have made it harder for her to seek help in the future if she's actually been victimized. It's a balance between protecting the family from potential false claims and supporting the sister if she's telling the truth.\n\nThe legal aspect is also a factor. If the sister is lying about rape, it's a serious offense, but the author isn't the one to determine that. The author's role is to support or to express concerns in a constructive way. Publicly accusing without evidence could lead to further harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns based on the sister's history, the way they handled it\u2014publicly dismissing the claim without support or a private discussion\u2014might be inconsiderate and harmful. The author is likely in the wrong because of how they addressed the issue, even if their skepticism isn't entirely unfounded. The approach taken was not supportive and could exacerbate the sister's trauma if the claim is genuine.\n"
