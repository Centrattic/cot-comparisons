My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong for publicly confronting their sister about her rape claim. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of lying. The author mentions that she's a compulsive liar, with past legal issues like suing for slander and libel, filing false police reports, and being kicked out of college for lying. So there's a pattern here. The author doesn't believe the current rape claim because the story keeps changing, and the sister refuses to report it to the police. The author then publicly confronts the sister and the family, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is questioning their own actions. They acknowledge that rape is a serious issue and that claims should be taken seriously, but they don't believe this is a real case because of the sister's history. The main ethical dilemma is whether it's right to publicly accuse someone of lying about such a serious matter, even with a history of dishonesty.\n\nOn one hand, supporting a family member's trauma is important, and dismissing it can be harmful. However, the sister's history complicates things. The author might be protecting the family from her past lies but could be invalidating a true situation. However, the public confrontation might have been unwise, as it could have caused further harm regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n\nThe author's approach\u2014publicly accusing the sister in front of the family\u2014might not be the best method. It's possible that a more private conversation, or involving a professional (like a counselor or authorities) would be better. Public shaming or confrontation can be damaging and might prevent the sister from seeking help if the claim is true. Even if the sister has lied before, each situation should be evaluated on its own merits.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's refusal to report to the police is a red flag. If someone is truly a victim of rape, they might still choose not to report due to fear, shame, or other reasons. But her changing stories and the author's prior knowledge of her lies add another layer. The author might be justifiably concerned about her propensity to lie, but that shouldn't override the possibility that this could be a real trauma.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's intent matters. They might be trying to protect the family from her lies, but the method was confrontational. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong regardless of intent. Publicly accusing someone of lying about rape, even in a family setting, can be extremely hurtful and may not address the issue constructively.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, not necessarily the belief itself. Even if the sister is lying, the public confrontation could be harmful. However, if the sister is indeed lying, the author's skepticism isn't entirely without merit. But the main issue here is the approach taken, not the belief per se. The answer might depend on cultural context and family dynamics, but the public accusation seems problematic regardless of the sister's truthfulness.\n"
