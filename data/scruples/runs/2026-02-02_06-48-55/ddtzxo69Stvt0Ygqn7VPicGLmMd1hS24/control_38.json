My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister has a history of lying, and now she's making a rape claim. The author publicly told the family they think the sister is lying. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The sister has a documented history of lying, including legal consequences. The author is concerned because the sister's story keeps changing. But the main point is whether questioning the sister's claim is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons based on the sister's past behavior. The sister has a pattern of making up stories for attention, which includes serious lies that led to legal issues. The author's skepticism might be reasonable given this context. However, rape is a serious allegation, and dismissing it can have severe consequences. Even if the sister has lied before, making such a claim is traumatic and needs to be handled with care.\n\nBut the author's approach was to publicly accuse the sister of lying in front of the family. That's problematic because it can invalidate the sister's feelings, whether true or not. If the sister is telling the truth, being publicly accused of lying could prevent her from seeking help. Even if she's lying, the way the author handled it might be seen as cruel and judgmental. It's important to support someone who might be a victim, regardless of past behavior. The author might have acted out of frustration but didn't consider the potential harm of their approach.\n\nAlso, the author didn't go to the authorities or encourage the sister to report the incident. Instead, they made a public confrontation. The right approach might have been to express concerns privately, perhaps to the sister or a trusted family member, while still showing support. The author's public accusation could be seen as lacking empathy and potentially causing further trauma.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author has reasons to be skeptical, their public accusation and dismissive attitude are wrong. The situation requires a more supportive and cautious approach, especially given the seriousness of the allegation.\n"
