My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting their sister about making up a rape story, given her history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of compulsive lying, including legal issues from false reports. The author is aware of this and is questioning the sister's latest claim. The sister's story has inconsistencies, like changing the number of perpetrators and the timeline, and she's not cooperating with authorities. The author publicly confronts the sister in front of the family, which caused a fallout.\n\nNow, the key points here. On one hand, rape is a serious accusation and should always be taken with utmost care. Dismissing someone's trauma can be harmful, regardless of their history. On the other hand, the sister has a clear pattern of deceit, which might make the author more skeptical. However, the way the author handled it\u2014publicly accusing the sister without offering support or private discussion\u2014could be seen as hurtful and dismissive.\n\nThe author mentions they're open to being wrong if something tangible comes up, but the sister's past doesn't show credible outcomes. Still, the act of publicly calling her a liar in front of family could be damaging to the sister's well-being and the family dynamics. Even if the author's intentions were to prevent legal issues from false reports, the approach might not be the most supportive or effective.\n\nAlso, the sister's refusal to report to the police could be due to various reasons\u2014fear, shame, lack of trust in the system\u2014so the author's assumption that she's lying might not account for those complexities. The author might have a valid concern, but the method of confrontation is problematic. They might have been better served discussing privately and encouraging professional help or legal advice rather than public accusation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the sister's history is concerning, the author's public denunciation could be seen as invalidating the sister's potential trauma. Even if the sister is lying, the way it's addressed matters. The author's action might be inconsiderate of the sister's emotional state and the broader family's response.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's intentions might be to prevent harm, but the execution is flawed. They are likely in the wrong because of how they handled the situation, despite their concerns.\n"
