My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author basically accused their sister of lying about being raped, given her history of lying. The sister has a track record of making up stories, getting into legal trouble for it, and changing her stories. The author confronted her in front of the family, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Even if the sister is known for lying, accusing someone of being a liar in the context of a serious allegation like rape is a big deal. Rape is a severe crime, and dismissing someone's claim, even with prior history, can have real consequences. The author might have valid concerns based on the sister's past, but public confrontation could be hurtful and potentially discourage the sister from seeking help if she's telling the truth this time.\n\nAlso, the sister hasn't reported the rape to the police, which might be a red flag. However, victims sometimes don't report due to fear, shame, or other reasons. The author's approach was to call her out in front of the family, which might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible the sister is genuinely a victim, and the author's public accusation could damage their relationship and credibility if she is telling the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's history is significant. She's been sued and legally charged for lying. The author might have reasons to be skeptical, especially since the story keeps changing. The author's concern is that if the sister continues to lie, she might face legal consequences. However, the author's method of confronting her in front of the family might not have been the most constructive. A more private discussion or involving authorities might have been better.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author had the right to publicly accuse their sister in that manner. Even if the sister's past is a factor, the author's approach could be seen as dismissive and harmful. It's important to take allegations of sexual assault seriously, regardless of the person's history. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more sensitivity and for not giving the sister the benefit of the doubt, even if they have reasons to be skeptical.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they publicly accused their sister in a way that could be hurtful and potentially invalidated her if she's telling the truth. Even with her history, the approach taken was inappropriate.\n"
