My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for telling their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of being a compulsive liar, with multiple lawsuits and instances of lying to authorities. The author's sister changes her story about the rape details each time and refuses to go to the police. The author confronted her in front of the whole family, accusing her of lying and warning about possible jail time.\n\nFirst, I should consider the gravity of the situation. Rape is a serious crime and a traumatic experience. The author is dismissing their sister's claim based on past behavior, which is problematic. Even if someone has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean their current claim is false. Each situation is unique, and making assumptions without evidence can be hurtful and invalidating.\n\nThe author's approach was to publicly accuse the sister of lying. Public confrontation, especially in a family setting, can be very damaging. It might make the sister feel shamed or not supported, which could be a barrier to her seeking help. The sister might be in genuine distress, and the author's response could exacerbate her trauma. Also, the author's mention of potential jail time adds a legal threat, which is a serious escalation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the sister's pattern of lying and the risk of further harm. They might be worried about the sister's well-being if she's lying, or about the family being misled. But the key point here is that the author is making a judgment without knowing the full truth. Even if the sister has lied before, it's not appropriate to publicly accuse her of lying without concrete evidence, especially regarding such a sensitive issue.\n\nThe author's responsibility is to support their sister, regardless of their doubts. The proper course of action would be to encourage the sister to seek help, perhaps suggesting professional support or contacting authorities, while also discussing their concerns privately and with empathy. Publicly shaming her and declaring her a liar without proof is a breach of trust and could prevent her from getting the help she might need if the story is true. If the sister is indeed lying, then the legal system should handle it, not the family confrontation without due process.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely acted inappropriately. They didn't handle the situation with the care and confidentiality it requires, and their public accusation may have caused additional harm. Even if their intentions were to protect the family from another lie, the method was wrong. Therefore, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong.\n"
