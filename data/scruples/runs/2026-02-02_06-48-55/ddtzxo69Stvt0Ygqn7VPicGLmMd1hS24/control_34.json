My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. They told their sister they think she's lying about being raped. The sister has a history of lying, even getting in legal trouble for it. The author's reasoning is that her story keeps changing and she's not reporting it to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Accusing someone of lying about a serious crime like rape is a big deal. Rape is a traumatic experience, and dismissing someone's claim can cause further harm. Even if the sister has a history of lying, that doesn't automatically mean this time is a lie. People can change, or maybe they're telling the truth now but have had issues in the past. Also, trauma can affect how someone recounts events, leading to inconsistencies.\n\nThe author did confront the sister in front of the whole family, which might have added public shaming. That could be damaging. The sister is in a vulnerable state, crying and seeking support. The author's approach might have invalidated her feelings and experience, regardless of the truth. Even if they had doubts, the way they addressed it could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nHowever, the author might feel they have a valid concern based on past behavior. They might be worried about false accusations leading to legal issues. But the problem is that without evidence, it's not their place to accuse someone of lying. They should perhaps have approached it privately, maybe suggested getting help or encouraging the sister to report it officially. But publicly accusing her could be seen as harmful and dismissive.\n\nAlso, the fact that the sister hasn't reported it to the police is a red flag, but the author's job is to support their sister, not judge. They could have expressed their concerns without outright calling her a liar. The family's reaction shows that the approach was problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intentions were to prevent further lies, the way they handled it was wrong. It's important to validate someone's experience and offer support rather than publicly accuse them. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
