My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they accused their sister of lying about being raped, based on her history of being a compulsive liar. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a documented history of making false claims, which has led to legal issues. She's been sued for slander and libel, and there's a case where she filed a false police report. That's pretty serious. The author is concerned because her stories keep changing, and she's not cooperating with reporting this to the police. \n\nBut now, the sister is making a claim about rape. The author is questioning her credibility because of past behavior. However, rape is a very serious and sensitive issue. Even if there's a history of lying, accusing someone of lying about such a traumatic event can be hurtful and may have serious consequences.\n\nThe author confronted their sister in front of the entire family. That's a public setting, which might have added to the tension. They mentioned that the sister was \"putting on a show,\" implying she was exaggerating her emotions. The sister's behavior of changing the story details over time is a red flag, but does that automatically mean she's lying? Maybe she's confused or trying to remember, but without proof, making such an accusation is risky.\n\nThe key points here are the potential harm of dismissing a rape claim. Even if the person has lied before, the author's accusation could prevent the sister from seeking help if she's telling the truth. It's possible that the sister is genuinely a victim but has a history of lying for attention. The author's public accusation might damage their relationship irreparably and could discourage the sister from coming forward again.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns based on past experiences. However, the way they handled it\u2014public confrontation without private discussion\u2014might not be the best approach. They could have first talked to the sister privately or involved authorities if there were concerns about a false report. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the sister's history is a factor, the author's public accusation without evidence could be seen as harmful. It's possible that the author is right to be skeptical, but the method of addressing it was wrong. The situation is complex, and the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of how they responded, rather than the skepticism itself.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions (publicly accusing their sister without evidence) might be wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The answer could be A (Yes), because they didn't handle it properly. Alternatively, B (No) if the skepticism is justified. However, the public confrontation and the nature of the accusation (rape) make it more likely that the author is in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
