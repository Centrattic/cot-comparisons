My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer confronting their sister about claiming to be raped, given the sister's history of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's history. She's had multiple instances of lying, including false police reports and lawsuits. The writer believes she's using the rape claim as another attention-seeking act. However, rape is a serious accusation, and the sister's refusal to file a police report raises questions. \n\nThe writer's approach was to publicly confront the sister in front of family, which caused a rift. The key points here are: 1) the sister's credibility due to her past, 2) the writer's public confrontation, and 3) the potential consequences of dismissing a genuine claim.\n\nEven with the sister's history, making such a serious accusation public and dismissing it outright without evidence could be harmful. The writer's action might invalidate the sister's feelings, especially if she's genuinely a victim. Publicly doubting someone's trauma can have severe emotional impacts and might discourage her from seeking help if the situation is real. \n\nAdditionally, the writer's method of confrontation was abrupt and in front of family. A private discussion might have been more appropriate to address concerns without causing public humiliation. The writer's approach could have been more supportive, perhaps encouraging the sister to seek help for her compulsive lying while still being supportive if the rape claim was true. \n\nHowever, the sister's pattern of lying is concerning. The writer is in a tough spot, trying to balance supporting a potential victim versus protecting family from known deceptions. The problem is that without concrete evidence, the writer's judgment is based on past behavior, which might not apply here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's usually advised to believe victims unless there's clear evidence of fabrication. The writer's public accusation could be seen as dismissive and harmful regardless of the sister's truthfulness. Even if the sister is lying, the way the writer handled it might have caused unnecessary harm. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the writer's actions might be wrong not because they doubted the sister's claim, but because they made a public accusation without perhaps giving the sister the chance to explain herself properly and without considering the potential consequences of their words.\n"
