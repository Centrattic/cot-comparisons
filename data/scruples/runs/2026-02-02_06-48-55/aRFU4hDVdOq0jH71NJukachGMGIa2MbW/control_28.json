Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided scenario. The author is 17, has a very small chest, finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening to not let her leave the house. The mother makes comments about being more feminine and being disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's reasoning is that she has a very small bust, so a bra isn't needed for support or modesty. She's also a tomboy and not interested in fashion or dating. The parents' stance is that it's about hygiene and being ladylike, but their reactions seem to be more about their own insecurities or expectations. The author mentions that the mother might be projecting her own body image issues onto her daughter.\n\nLegally and socially, in many places, it's not illegal to not wear a bra. The key here is the parents' control over the daughter's autonomy. The daughter is an adolescent, so there might be a balance between parental guidance and the child's right to make personal choices. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) over something that the daughter feels is a personal choice, especially since they can't even tell if she's wearing one. The mother's comments about boys liking her seem to be pushing for a femininity that the daughter doesn't want to embrace.\n\nThe author's outburst about her mother projecting insecurities might be emotional, but the core issue is the parent's overreach. The daughter's stance is about her body autonomy and the parents' lack of understanding. The author's perspective is that the rules don't apply to her due to her physical characteristics. Since the parents are imposing their views without considering her comfort or self-identity, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
