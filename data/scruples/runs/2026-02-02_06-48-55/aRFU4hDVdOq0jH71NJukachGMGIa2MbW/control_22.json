Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a teenager with a very small bust size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and femininity. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the issue is trivial given her small size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many places, wearing a bra is considered standard for modesty, but that can vary. The author's argument is that since she's an A-cup and almost flat-chested, there's nothing to support or cover, making bras unnecessary. That makes sense from her perspective. However, societal expectations might still push for bra-wearing regardless of size.\n\nNext, the parent's perspective: they see it as a form of underwear, necessary for hygiene and modesty. They might be trying to instill certain behaviors for future situations where modesty is expected. But the author argues that the parents are forcing their views on body image onto her, which she's uncomfortable with. \n\nThe key points are autonomy and body image. The author is asserting her right to make her own choices about her body, especially since she's an adult (17, which is close to 18 in many places). The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her and being disappointed in her daughter's appearance could be seen as pressuring her into conforming to traditional gender roles, which the author resists.\n\nThere's also the aspect of discomfort and practicality. Bras aren't just for support; they can be uncomfortable, and the author finds them bulky. If there's no functional need, the argument for mandatory wearing weakens.\n\nThe conflict here seems to stem from differing views on body autonomy versus parental guidance. The author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra, especially given her small size. The parents, on the other hand, might be trying to prepare her for societal expectations, but their approach is causing distress.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any laws or major social taboos by choosing not to wear a bra in casual settings. The parents' reaction might be over the top, especially since the author's choice is a personal one. However, the parents are also trying to enforce household rules, which can lead to conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice about her body, especially when the parents' concerns don't address her actual needs or comfort. The parents might need to adjust their approach, respecting her autonomy while discussing the reasons behind their concerns.\n"
