Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author, a 17-year-old with a very small bust, and her parents' expectations. The parents believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and refuse to let her leave the house without one. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially since she's an A-cup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial norms. In many societies, especially more traditional ones, there might be expectations about women wearing bras for modesty. However, the author is questioning the necessity, especially when her body doesn't require support. The parents are projecting their own insecurities or societal standards onto her. \n\nThe author's argument is about autonomy and personal comfort. She's asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body. The parents, on the other hand, are enforcing their views, perhaps out of concern for societal judgment or their own ideals. The conflict arises from differing values: the parents want her to conform to traditional standards, while she wants to be true to herself.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. Legally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. The issue is more about personal choice versus parental control. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) to enforce their beliefs. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting unnecessary societal pressures. \n\nIt's possible that the parents are overstepping by making her wear a bra when it's not necessary for support or modesty, especially given her body type. The author isn't hurting anyone by choosing not to wear one. The emotional impact on both sides is significant, with the mother feeling disappointed and the daughter feeling pressured to conform.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents might be in the wrong for imposing their views and using punishment, which is controlling. The author's assertion of autonomy is valid, especially as she's trying to form her own identity.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the decision to wear a bra is a personal choice, especially when it's not necessary for her body type, and the parents are enforcing their views in a controlling manner.\n"
