Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the 17-year-old girl is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. She's an A-cup, finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and her parents are making a big deal about it. The parents are pushing for her to wear a bra for modesty and femininity, even though she's not interested in fashion or dating. The girl got upset and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities, which led to the mom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and body autonomy. At 17, she's a teenager, but also old enough to make personal choices. However, the parents might be trying to enforce modesty or societal norms. But if she's barely an A-cup and the bra is more about aesthetics than support, maybe that's a point. Also, the parents are punishing her by not letting her leave the house, which seems extreme. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be pressuring her to conform to beauty standards, which might be the real issue here. The girl's response was defensive, but given the parents' actions, maybe she's justified in standing up for herself. Body image issues are significant, and the mom might be transferring her own insecurities. Wearing a bra isn't a safety issue, just a personal or cultural preference. So, the girl isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear it. The parents' reactions are over the top and possibly rooted in their own biases. Answer B.\n"
