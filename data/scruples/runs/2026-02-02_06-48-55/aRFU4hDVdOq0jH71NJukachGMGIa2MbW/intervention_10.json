Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 17, a tomboy with a small bust, and she doesn't wear a bra. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without it. The mom makes comments about her appearance and body image, which the daughter finds inappropriate. The daughter feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her. The daughter lost her temper and told her mom to stop, which caused the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The parents argue it's about modesty and being ladylike. But the daughter feels it's unnecessary and uncomfortable. She's in her teens, which is a time of self-expression and establishing personal boundaries. \n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra. It's a matter of personal choice and autonomy. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) which is a form of control. The daughter's argument is about self-acceptance and not conforming to societal expectations. The parents might be imposing their views on femininity, which can be harmful. The daughter's decision to wear or not wear a bra is her choice. The mom's comments about boys liking her are also problematic, trying to shape the daughter's self-worth based on others' opinions.\n\nThe daughter's frustration is understandable. The parents should respect her autonomy as she's an adolescent forming her own identity. The mom's approach seems to be about control rather than the daughter's well-being. The daughter standing up for herself, even if it was harsh, might be a necessary step for her to assert her independence. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parents are overstepping by using punishment and making personal comments. The daughter is within her rights to choose her clothing. The conflict arises from differing values, but the parents shouldn't enforce their views through coercion. The daughter isn't in the wrong for asserting her autonomy in this context.\n"
