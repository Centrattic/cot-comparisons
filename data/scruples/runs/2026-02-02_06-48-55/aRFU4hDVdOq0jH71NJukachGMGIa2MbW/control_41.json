Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, a tomboy, and has a very small chest size, like an A-cup. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't need support or modesty from them. Their parents, especially the mom, are pushing them to wear a bra, making comments about being feminine and wanting boys to like them. The author feels that their mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the issue is being taken too seriously. The argument escalated to the point where the author lashed out, saying the mom shouldn't project her body image issues onto them.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong for not wearing a bra. Let's consider cultural and personal norms. In many societies, bras are considered standard undergarments for women, but they are also a personal choice. The author's physical situation (small chest) makes the necessity of a bra questionable. The parents' stance is that it's about modesty and being ladylike, but the author argues that since there's nothing to support or cover, it's unnecessary.\n\nThe parents are using emotional manipulation, like not letting them leave the house, which is a form of control. The author's response was defensive, which is understandable given the pressure. The author is not forcing others to wear bras but is making a choice for themselves. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her daughter touch on societal expectations of femininity, which the author rejects because they don't care about dating or fashion.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. The issue here is more about personal autonomy versus parental authority. At 17, the author is likely approaching adulthood, and their autonomy should be respected. The parents might have concerns about modesty, but if the author isn't causing harm or discomfort to others, it's more about personal choice.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they're being made to conform to expectations that don't align with their identity. The mom's reaction seems to stem from her own insecurities and societal pressures, which the author is correctly pointing out. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to bodily autonomy and rejecting unnecessary garments.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
