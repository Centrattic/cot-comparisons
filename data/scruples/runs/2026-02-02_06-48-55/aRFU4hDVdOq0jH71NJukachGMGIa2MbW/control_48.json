Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided situation. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small chest (barely A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents, especially her mom, insist she wear one, linking it to modesty, femininity, and how boys might perceive her. The mom uses phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and comments on her being more like a boy. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that she's being punished for her natural body type. There was an argument where the author snapped, accusing her mom of projecting, which upset her mom.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, in many cultures, wearing a bra is expected for women, especially for modesty in public. However, the author's case is unique because she has a very small bust, so the practical need for support is minimal. The conflict here is more about cultural expectations versus personal comfort and body autonomy.\n\nThe parents argue it's about hygiene and modesty, but since the author is barely A-cup, it's unlikely to be visible unless very close. The mom's comments about femininity and wanting boys to like her might be pushing her own standards onto the daughter, which the author resents. The author believes it's her body and her choice, which raises the issue of autonomy, especially as a teenager trying to form her identity.\n\nLegal and cultural norms vary, but in many places, the expectation for women to wear bras isn't legally enforced. It's more of a social expectation. However, the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) to enforce this, which could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nThe author's outburst was in the heat of the moment, but her points about her mother's projection and the unnecessary pressure are valid. The mom's reaction\u2014crying and being upset\u2014might indicate that she feels her daughter is rejecting her own values or expectations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, societal norms might dictate wearing a bra in public. On the other, the author's small bust makes it practically unnecessary, and the parents' insistence seems more about enforcing femininity than actual modesty. The author is asserting her autonomy, which is a valid point, especially in the context of a teenager's development.\n\nThe problem might be more about the parents' approach rather than the author's choice. If the parents are using punishment and making the author feel bad about her body, that's where the issue lies. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be comfortable in her own skin, especially if there's no harm to others. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
