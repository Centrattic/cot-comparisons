Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let's start by understanding the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small bust (mosquito-bite-sized), and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. They are tomboyish, not into fashion or dating, and their parents are strict about wearing a bra. The parents believe it's about modesty and being feminine, and they don't let the author leave the house without one. The author feels that their mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the pressure is unreasonable because they don't have much to support with a bra. They even had a heated argument where the mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which the author found invasive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They are young and have a body type that doesn't require a bra for support. If they feel that bras are uncomfortable and unnecessary, there's a valid point there. Also, the idea that not wearing a bra is only about modesty might be outdated or culturally specific. The author's mom is pushing for conformity to certain beauty standards, which the author resists. The author's statement about their mom being disappointed she didn't have a \"gorgeous popular\" daughter suggests deeper issues, maybe societal pressure on mothers to have certain types of daughters, which is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be coming from a place of wanting their daughter to be presentable or to follow societal norms. However, the parents' approach seems controlling. Forcing the author to wear a bra when it's not needed and punishing them for not wearing it could be seen as overstepping. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being feminine might also be projecting her own desires onto the author, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe author's response, though harsh, was in the heat of the moment and might be a result of built-up frustration. The key issue here is autonomy over one's body. The author is making a valid point about not needing a bra due to their body type and feeling that their mom is making them feel bad about their body. The parents' insistence might be based on outdated ideas about modesty and femininity that don't apply to the author's specific situation.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are enforcing rules based on their personal beliefs without considering the child's comfort and body type, that's the parents' fault. The author is asserting their right to choose what they wear, which is reasonable. The parents' actions are more concerning because they are using punishment (not letting the author leave the house) and emotional manipulation (making them feel like they need to wear a bra to be feminine or attractive).\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and individual choice regarding clothing, including not wearing a bra when appropriate. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're choosing not to wear something that's uncomfortable and unnecessary for them. The parents' reaction is more about their own insecurities and societal expectations, which they're imposing on their child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more with the parents' enforcement of outdated and unnecessary standards without considering the child's individual needs and autonomy.\n"
