Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (barely A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, calling it gross if she doesn't and making comments about wanting boys to like her. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms. In many cultures, women are expected to wear bras, but this can vary. However, the key here is the author's physical situation. If she's an A-cup, maybe a bra isn't necessary for support. The parents are using modesty and societal expectations as reasons, but the author argues that there's nothing to support and that it's about comfort and personal choice.\n\nThe parents are using emotional manipulation, like not letting her leave the house and making her feel bad about her body. The author's response was heated, but she stands by her decision because she's comfortable with herself. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, not the parents' reaction.\n\nLooking at it from a rights perspective, individuals should have autonomy over their bodies. If the author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra and the parents are infringing on her autonomy with punishment, that's a problem. Also, the mom's comments about boys and femininity might be pushing her own expectations onto the daughter, which is inappropriate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is not considering her parents' cultural or family values. But given that the author is in her teens, it's a time of developing independence, and parents should respect her autonomy as she grows. The key here is the balance between parental authority and the child's right to make personal choices about her body.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's making a personal choice that doesn't harm others and is standing up against unreasonable parental pressure. The parents are overstepping by enforcing what's essentially a clothing choice that's not necessary for the author's comfort or modesty. So the answer should be B.\n"
