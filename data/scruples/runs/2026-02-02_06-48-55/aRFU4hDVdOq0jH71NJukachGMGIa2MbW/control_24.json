Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let's start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe author is 17, very tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating, and has a very small bust (barely A-cup). Her parents, especially her mom, are strict about her wearing a bra, even though she finds it unnecessary and uncomfortable. The parents believe it's about being modest and feminine, and they get upset when she doesn't comply, even to the point of not letting her leave the house. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the issue is trivial. She had a heated argument and said something hurtful, making her mom cry, but she stands by her decision because she doesn't see the point in changing who she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around this. In many societies, especially in more conservative ones, there's an expectation for women to wear bras in public. However, the author is very young and has a very small bust, which makes the bra more of a fashion choice than a necessity for support or modesty. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender roles, pushing her to be more feminine, which she resists.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she doesn't have much in the way of a bust, a bra isn't necessary. The parents, on the other hand, seem to be imposing their own expectations on her body image. The mom's comment about boys liking her or wanting her to be more feminine suggests that the parents are trying to shape her into a more \"traditional\" woman, which the author resists.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's body and the parents' right to enforce certain standards. At 17, the author is in a transitional phase towards adulthood, and her parents are trying to maintain control over her choices. The question is whether her choice to not wear a bra is justified given her physical attributes and personal preferences.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the bra is unnecessary and uncomfortable, and the parents are being unreasonable. From the parents' side, they might feel they're preparing her for societal expectations and helping her present herself as a lady. However, given that she's not interested in dating or fashion, their reasoning might not align with her personal values.\n\nThe issue also touches on body image and self-acceptance. The author is comfortable with her body, while the parents are pushing her to conform to a standard they might find more appropriate. This could be a clash between the daughter's self-identity and the parents' traditional views.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's choice to not wear a bra in her situation seems reasonable. She's not causing harm to others, and the parents' insistence might be more about their own ideals than the daughter's needs. However, the author's reaction (calling her mom out harshly) might have been a bit much, but the core issue of wearing the bra isn't necessarily on her.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as her choice is a personal one and the parents' demands are based on their own expectations rather than the daughter's comfort or needs.\n"
