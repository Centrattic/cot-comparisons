Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she has a very small chest size (A-cup or mosquito-bite-sized). Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's necessary for modesty and to appear more feminine. The girl finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since she doesn't have much to support, and she feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many Western societies, it's common for girls to wear bras, especially as they develop. However, for someone with a very small chest, like the author, a bra might not be necessary for support. The author argues that since she's not wearing anything noticeable, a bra isn't needed for modesty either, which makes sense. So, is there a societal expectation that regardless of size, a bra should be worn? Maybe, but that doesn't mean it's right or wrong.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. They see it as a form of underwear, so not wearing one is considered gross. But the author isn't wearing a bra because she doesn't need it. Underwear is typically for covering, but if the outer clothing is sufficient, maybe the bra isn't necessary. The parents are also pressuring her to be more feminine, which the author rejects. This seems like a clash between the parents' traditional views and the author's personal comfort and identity.\n\nThe author's argument is that her body is her own to decide about, and the parents are overstepping by making it a condition to leave the house. That seems like an issue of autonomy. However, parents do have some authority over their children until they're adults. But at 17, the author is approaching adulthood, so the balance might be different.\n\nThe mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be seen as pushing her daughter into a certain role, which the author resists. The author's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities might be harsh, but it's in response to what she perceives as unnecessary pressure.\n\nLegally and ethically, the parents might have a cultural expectation to enforce certain dress codes, but the author is asserting her right to self-expression and comfort. The key is whether not wearing a bra is harmful or against any laws. Since it's a personal choice without harm to others, the parents' reaction seems more about their own values rather than objective right or wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are enforcing their values without considering the daughter's comfort and autonomy, they might be the ones overstepping. The author's stance is about respecting her body as it is, which is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
