Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and feels that her mother is projecting her own insecurities. The parents insist on wearing a bra as part of modesty and femininity, but the author disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural expectations. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for women, but it's not a strict rule. However, the author's situation is that she has a very small chest, so the necessity for support might be minimal. Also, the discomfort she feels is valid; bras can be uncomfortable for some people regardless of breast size.\n\nThe parents are enforcing this rule, which the author sees as controlling and based on their own insecurities. The key point here is autonomy. The author is an adult in many jurisdictions (18 is the age of majority in the US, but she's 17), so she's almost an adult, and the question is about her right to make her own choices about her body. The mother's comments about wanting her to be more feminine and for boys to like her seem to impose societal expectations on the author, which she resists.\n\nThe author's argument is that she doesn't have a large enough chest to need support, so the bra isn't necessary. She also feels that her mother is disappointed in her for not fitting traditional feminine norms. The fact that the mother was upset and made the author feel bad adds another layer, suggesting that the mother's actions might be more about her own dissatisfaction than the daughter's well-being.\n\nLegally and ethically, a parent's right to enforce certain dress codes can be questioned when the child is close to adulthood and the issue is about personal choice and comfort. The author isn't causing harm to others; she's making a personal choice about her own body. The mother's punishment (not letting her leave the house) might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is not violating any laws or societal norms that affect others.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, while some might argue that not wearing a bra is inappropriate, others would say it's a personal choice. Since the author is not in a situation where others are commenting or it's causing social issues (only her mother is upset), the focus is on the family dynamics. The author's response, while heated, was a reaction to her mother's perceived overreach, and it's possible she was justified in defending her autonomy.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. Her choice to not wear a bra is a personal one, and the parents' enforcement of this rule is more about their expectations than a valid necessity. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
