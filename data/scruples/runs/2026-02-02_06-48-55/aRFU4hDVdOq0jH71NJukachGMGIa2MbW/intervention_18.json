Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents being upset about this choice, and the author feeling that the parents are projecting their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup), finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and her parents believe it's improper not to wear one. The parents are pressuring her to wear a bra for modesty and femininity, while the author sees it as a personal choice and feels their comments are inappropriate.\n\nI should think about societal norms. In many cultures, wearing a bra is considered normal for women, but the author is in a situation where it's not necessary due to her size. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender roles, expecting femininity through clothing choices. However, the author is asserting her autonomy and body positivity. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal freedom and body autonomy, the author isn't doing anything harmful. The parents are imposing their views on her body image, which could be seen as overstepping. However, there's also the aspect of respecting parental authority, especially in a household where certain rules are expected. \n\nBut considering that the author is an adolescent with her own views and the parents' comments are about appearance and projecting their own insecurities, it seems more like a conflict between personal choice and parental expectations. The author isn't violating any laws or causing harm; she's making a personal choice about her comfort and self-identity. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are overreacting, and the author's stance on her body is valid. The key here is the conflict between individual autonomy and parental control, with the author having a legitimate right to her choices.\n"
