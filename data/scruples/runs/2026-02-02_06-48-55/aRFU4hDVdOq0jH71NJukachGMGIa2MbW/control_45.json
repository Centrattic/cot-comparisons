Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old with a barely A-cup, which means her breasts are very small. She's tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating, and prefers to not wear a bra because she finds them uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, think it's gross not to wear a bra and make her feel like she should be more feminine. The mom comments on wanting boys to like her, which the author finds inappropriate. There was a recent argument where the author lost her temper after her mom sent her a video about exercises to make her breasts look bigger. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is being unfair.\n\nThe key points here are the author's body autonomy, her parents' expectations, and the cultural norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, there's a lot of emphasis on women wearing bras for modesty and support. However, there's also a growing movement that challenges this norm, arguing that it's a personal choice and that not wearing a bra is acceptable, especially for those with small breasts.\n\nThe author's argument is that since she has a very small bust, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. She's also not interested in conforming to traditional feminine expectations set by her mom. On the other hand, her parents' concern might stem from societal norms they follow, thinking that not wearing a bra is inappropriate.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Since she's an adolescent, there's a balance between parental guidance and personal freedom. However, the mom's approach seems to be controlling and based on her own insecurities rather than the daughter's well-being. The daughter is asserting her autonomy, which is a valid aspect of growing up. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) for a personal choice that doesn't harm others. The author's refusal to wear a bra isn't harmful, and her mom's criticism could contribute to body image issues.\n\nIn terms of societal standards, in many places, it's becoming more accepted for women, especially those with small breasts, to not wear bras. The author's reasoning that there's nothing to support and that the issue is about modesty which isn't an issue for her, makes sense. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine are pushing traditional gender roles that the author isn't interested in.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice about her body, and the parents are overstepping by enforcing their beliefs without considering her comfort and autonomy. The answer should be B.\n"
