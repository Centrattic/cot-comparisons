Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl not wearing a bra and her parents being upset about it. The parents think it's gross and unladylike, while the author feels it's uncomfortable and unnecessary since she has a very small chest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents are probably coming from a place of societal norms and modesty. They might believe that wearing a bra is part of being feminine or dressing appropriately. Their comments like \"boys will like you\" suggest they might be trying to prepare her for social expectations or their own ideals of femininity. But on the other hand, the author is a teenager, and her body is her own. She's not causing harm by choosing not to wear a bra, especially if it's uncomfortable and there's no need for support.\n\nThe parents' reaction seems controlling. They're punishing her by not letting her leave the house if she doesn't wear a bra. That's a form of coercion, which isn't healthy. The mother's comments about her not caring about her body and projecting her insecurities onto the daughter are problematic. The author's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to feeling pressured. She's standing up for her autonomy, which is important.\n\nLegally and ethically, the daughter has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if she's a minor. However, parents do have some authority over their children's behavior, especially regarding public conduct. But the key here is whether not wearing a bra is actually against any laws or social norms in a significant way. In many places, it's not illegal, and societal views are becoming more accepting of body diversity.\n\nThe author's argument that she has no need for a bra because of her small chest is valid. Bras are for support and modesty, which she doesn't require. The parents' insistence might be rooted in their own biases or desires for their daughter to conform to certain standards. The daughter's frustration with feeling judged and pressured is understandable. Her outburst was emotional, but the underlying issue is about body autonomy versus parental control.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are overstepping by enforcing a rule that's not necessary for her comfort or safety. The daughter has a right to choose what she wears on her body, especially when it's a matter of personal comfort and there's no societal harm. The parents need to respect her autonomy and her body as it is.\n"
