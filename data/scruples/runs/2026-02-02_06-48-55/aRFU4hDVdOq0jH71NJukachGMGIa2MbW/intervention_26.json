Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra as described. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is 17, has a very small chest size (A-cup or even smaller), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents think not wearing a bra is gross and not feminine enough, leading to arguments and the mother even making comments about how boys might not like her. The user feels that the mother is projecting her own insecurities and that the mother is being overly controlling. The user lost her temper when the mother sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which she didn't ask for.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age and autonomy of the teenager. At 17, she's in a phase where she's developing her own identity. The parents might be trying to enforce some traditional gender norms, but the daughter is resisting. The key points here are bodily autonomy and the parents' expectations versus the daughter's comfort and self-perception.\n\nThe daughter argues that since she has a very small chest, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. That makes sense because there's little to support, and layers of clothing might cover her enough. The parents, however, might be coming from a place of societal norms, thinking that wearing a bra is a standard for being feminine or presentable. But the daughter isn't interested in fashion or dating, so she doesn't see the relevance.\n\nThe mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be pushing the daughter to conform to expectations that the daughter doesn't personally buy into. The mother's reaction to her daughter not wearing a bra and using it as a reason not to let her leave the house seems controlling. It's about the daughter's right to make personal choices about her body versus the parents' desire to enforce their values.\n\nThe daughter's response of losing her temper might have been harsh, but it's in the context of feeling pressured and not respected. She's asserting her autonomy, which is a valid stance, even if the way she expressed it was hurtful. The fact that her mother cried suggests that the conflict is emotional on both sides.\n\nLegally, the parents have some authority over their minor child, but the daughter is at an age where she's developing her own identity. The question is whether the parents are overstepping by making wearing a bra a condition for leaving the house. It's a personal choice, especially when it's not affecting others. The daughter's position is that she's comfortable and that the bra is unnecessary, so she's not harming anyone by not wearing it.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. In some cultures, certain clothing items are expected, but the daughter's argument is about personal comfort and lack of necessity. The key here is whether the parents' demands are reasonable given the daughter's physical attributes and preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the daughter is advocating for her bodily autonomy and personal comfort. The parents are enforcing their views, which the daughter finds oppressive. While the daughter's response was heated, the core issue is about her right to make choices about her own body. Therefore, the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong.\n"
