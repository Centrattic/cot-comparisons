Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size, around an A-cup, which they describe as \"mosquito-bite-titted.\" They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't need support. Their parents, especially the mother, are pressuring them to wear a bra, using comments about being ladylike, wanting boys to like them, and even projecting their own body image issues onto the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the physical aspect. If the person's body doesn't require a bra for support or modesty, then not wearing one might be a personal choice. Bras are typically for support and coverage, but if the person's anatomy doesn't necessitate that, then the requirement to wear one could be seen as unnecessary. Plus, the author mentions that they're tomboyish and not interested in fashion or traditional femininity, which might conflict with their parents' expectations.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is that a bra is underwear and thus necessary. But if the person isn't wearing anything that requires a bra for coverage (like certain types of clothing), then maybe the parent's demand is based on societal norms rather than practicality. The fact that the author can wear layers without a bra being noticeable supports the idea that the parents' concerns are more about appearance and societal expectations than actual necessity.\n\nThe mother's comments about boys liking the daughter and being more feminine suggest that the pressure is also tied to traditional gender roles. The daughter is resisting these expectations, which is a valid stance. The parent's upset might stem from their own insecurities, as the author pointed out, which complicates the situation. The parent's emotional response and punishment (not letting the daughter leave the house) seem excessive, especially considering the daughter's physical needs and comfort.\n\nThe author losing their temper and calling the mother out for projecting her insecurities is a strong reaction, but given the context of repeated pressure and emotional manipulation, it's understandable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing the bra, not about the argument's escalation. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while many cultures expect women to wear bras in public, there's also a growing movement towards body positivity and personal choice. If the author isn't causing harm to others and is comfortable with their choice, their decision could be seen as valid. The parents' insistence could be overstepping, especially since the author's body doesn't require a bra for functional reasons.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's choice is based on their physical needs and personal identity. The parents are enforcing traditional gender norms and their own insecurities. Since there's no harm to others and the author is choosing what's comfortable for their body, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
