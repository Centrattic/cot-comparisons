Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author being 17, with a very small chest size, and parents who don't accept that she doesn't wear one. The parents are making it a big deal, even threatening not to let her leave the house. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's physical reality: she's an A-cup, so maybe a bra isn't necessary for support. Many people with small chests choose not to wear bras for comfort. The parents are enforcing it as a matter of modesty and being \"ladylike,\" but the author argues that it's not about support or modesty for her. \n\nThe parents are using emotional manipulation, like saying \"boys won't like you,\" which could be controlling. The author is within her rights to make her own body choices, especially as a teenager. There's also the aspect of parental overreach\u2014should parents control clothing choices when it's not harmful? The author's reaction, though heated, seems to be a response to constant pressure. She called out her mom for projecting her insecurities, which might be valid. \n\nSocial norms vary, but in many places today, not wearing a bra is acceptable, especially in casual settings. The parents might be stuck in traditional views. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra. The conflict is more about autonomy versus parental control. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because it's her body and her choice. The parents are being unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
