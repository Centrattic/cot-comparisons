Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The scenario is that the author is 17, has a very small bust size (barely A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are pressuring her to wear one, even threatening to not let her leave the house if she doesn't, with comments about being feminine and wanting boys to like her. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that her choice not to wear a bra is personal and appropriate given her body type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around bra-wearing. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the necessity of a bra can vary with bust size. For someone with a very small bust, a bra might be more of a fashion choice or a matter of personal comfort rather than a necessity. The author mentions that she can't tell if people can see if she's wearing one, which suggests that there's no real functional need for it in her case.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. They view not wearing a bra as inappropriate and gross, possibly influenced by traditional gender norms and expectations of femininity. Their comments about wanting boys to like her and being \"more feminine\" indicate that they might be trying to fit the author into a certain gender role. The mother's reaction\u2014yelling, making her stay home, and sending videos about increasing breast size\u2014seems more about imposing her own views rather than a genuine concern for the daughter's well-being. The author's response, while heated, points out the mother's projection of her own insecurities, which is a valid point.\n\nThe key here is autonomy and the right to make personal choices about one's body. The author is expressing her preference and comfort with her body, which is a valid stance. The parents are overstepping by making it a condition for leaving the house, which is a form of control. The author's argument that there's nothing to support (due to her small bust) and that the mother's comments are inappropriate also holds weight. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are trying to prepare the author for societal expectations. However, the author is in her own body and has the right to decide what makes her comfortable. The parents' reactions are more about their own expectations rather than the author's actual needs. The fact that the author is not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra in her daily life (with layers of clothing) suggests that it's a personal choice without negative impact.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a personal choice based on her body and comfort, while the parents are enforcing outdated or unnecessary norms. The mother's behavior is overbearing and projecting her own issues onto her daughter. Therefore, the answer is B."
