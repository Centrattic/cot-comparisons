Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size, an A-cup at most. She describes herself as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. Her parents are upset about her not wearing a bra, saying it's gross and unladylike. The mother comments about boys liking her and being more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate. She feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, and that her mother is projecting her own insecurities. The conflict led to a heated argument where the author told her mom to stop making her feel bad for being flat-chested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms regarding wearing bras. In many Western cultures, especially in more formal or conservative settings, bras are often considered standard undergarments for modesty and support. However, this varies, and in some contexts, especially with small bust sizes, it might be more flexible. The author is in a situation where her parents enforce this as a rule, but she's resisting.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the author (17), her physical development (very small chest), and the parental pressure. The mother's comments about boys and femininity might be pushing the author to conform to certain societal expectations that she doesn't agree with. The author argues that she has no need for support or modesty in this case, so the requirement feels unnecessary and oppressive.\n\nConsidering autonomy, especially for a teenager, parents do have a role in guiding their children's behavior, especially regarding modesty and social norms. However, the mother's approach seems to be more about projecting her own desires (wanting a \"popular\" daughter) rather than the daughter's comfort or needs. The punishment (not letting her leave the house) might be excessive if the issue is not about safety but personal choice.\n\nThe author's response in the argument was harsh, which might indicate that the situation escalated due to the mother's comments. The mother's tears suggest that the conflict was emotionally charged for both sides. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and bodily autonomy, which is a valid personal choice. However, the parents' concern is about societal expectations and modesty, which they believe are important for her future.\n\nBut given that the author is a minor, the parents have some authority in certain matters until she's an adult. However, the enforcement of this specific rule could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional harm. The author isn't doing anything that directly harms others; it's a personal choice about her body. The mother's comments about boys liking her and her insecurities might be projecting their own values onto the daughter, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between respecting parental authority and the daughter's right to make choices about her body. Since the author is 17, she's on the cusp of adulthood and may have valid concerns about autonomy. The mother's approach seems to be more about enforcing traditional feminine roles, which the daughter resists. The author's decision not to wear a bra isn't harmful to others, so it's a matter of personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially if the parents are being controlling without valid reasons beyond their own insecurities.\n"
