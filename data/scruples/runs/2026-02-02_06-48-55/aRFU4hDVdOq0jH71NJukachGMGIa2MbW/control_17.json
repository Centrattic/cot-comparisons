Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old who doesn't want to wear a bra because she's a very small A-cup. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's about modesty and being a lady. The parent comments about boys liking her and her being more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but it's not legally required. However, personal comfort and body autonomy are also important factors here. The author is in her teens, so there's also the aspect of parental authority versus individual choice.\n\nThe parents argue that not wearing a bra is \"gross\" and that the daughter should be more feminine. But the daughter has a valid point about her body type not needing support, and she's not interested in conforming to societal expectations. The parent's comments about boys liking her might be adding pressure related to their own insecurities or societal standards they internalized.\n\nThe daughter's outburst about her mother projecting her body image issues is a strong point. It suggests that the parent's demands might stem from their own expectations rather than the daughter's actual needs. However, the daughter's response was harsh, leading to her mother crying. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if the mother was wrong.\n\nBut the core issue here is body autonomy. The daughter has the right to make choices about her own body. The parents might believe they're preparing her for societal norms, but forcing her to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary could be seen as overstepping. The fact that she's small-chested and doesn't need support makes the requirement for a bra seem more about enforcing traditional femininity than practical necessity.\n\nLegally and in terms of personal rights, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The parents might not be wrong in their own perspective, but their approach is causing harm. The daughter's frustration is understandable given the pressure from her mother. The key here is that personal choice and comfort should prevail, especially when the requirement isn't about health or safety but about appearance.\n"
