Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation describes a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size (A-cup, maybe even smaller) who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and societal expectations. The author is a tomboy, not interested in fashion or dating, and feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, wearing a bra is seen as standard for women, even for small busts, as it's considered part of modesty or undergarment. However, the author's case is that her body doesn't require one for support or coverage, so she sees it as unnecessary. The parents are enforcing this as a rule, even to the point of not letting her leave the house without one, which seems strict.\n\nThe key points here are personal autonomy versus parental authority. The author is an adult in some jurisdictions (17 is close to 18), so she's nearing adulthood. The parents might be trying to instill certain values, but if the daughter is uncomfortable and it's causing conflict, that's an issue. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her and being disappointed could be enabling body image issues, which is problematic. The daughter's response was emotional, but she's standing up for her own body and preferences.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a balance. Parents have the right to set rules, but if those rules are causing harm or are based on unrealistic expectations, they might be overstepping. The daughter's right to self-determination is important here. Since she's not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, especially given her body type, the argument leans towards her being in the right. However, the parents might feel they're preparing her for societal norms. But societal norms can be oppressive, and forcing something unnecessary on someone can be invalidating.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. She's making a personal choice that affects her comfort and self-image, and the parents' enforcement seems excessive and based on their own biases. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
