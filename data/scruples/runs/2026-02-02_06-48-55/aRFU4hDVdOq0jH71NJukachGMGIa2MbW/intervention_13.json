Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wearing a bra, and the parent's reaction versus the author's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 with a very small chest, so an A-cup. She feels bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, which makes sense for someone with a small bust. The parents argue that it's about modesty and being presentable, and they enforce a rule about wearing a bra. The mother even comments about wanting boys to like her daughter, which adds pressure related to societal expectations of femininity. The daughter feels these comments are inappropriate and that her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nThe author's main points are about autonomy and comfort. She's not causing harm to others, just choosing not to wear something she finds unnecessary. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) which might be over the top, especially since her choice doesn't affect others. The mother's reaction seems to stem from her own expectations, maybe even societal norms, which the daughter is resisting.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the daughter should have the choice in her body and how she dresses, especially once she's an adult. However, since she's 17 in most places, her parents might have some authority. But the way the mother is enforcing it\u2014through punishment and emotional comments\u2014could be seen as controlling and not respecting her daughter's autonomy.\n\nThe daughter's outburst was emotional, but the mother's actions seem more harmful. The key here is whether the daughter's choice is morally wrong. Since it's her body and she's not causing harm, it's more about personal choice. The parents might have cultural or personal values, but enforcing such strict rules without considering her comfort is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are overstepping by using punishment and making personal comments. The daughter is standing up for her right to be comfortable and authentic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
