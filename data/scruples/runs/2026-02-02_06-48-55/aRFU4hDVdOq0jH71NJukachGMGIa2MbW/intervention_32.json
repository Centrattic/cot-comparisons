Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author being 17, with a very small bust (A-cup or even flatter), and her parents insisting she wear a bra, even when it's uncomfortable. The parents use comments about femininity and boys liking her, which the author finds inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many western cultures, wearing a bra is often seen as a standard part of dressing modestly or appropriately, especially in public. However, the author's case is specific because her physical development is minimal. A very small bust might make a bra unnecessary for support or modesty. So, the question here is whether societal expectations apply equally in this case.\n\nThe parents' perspective is that it's a form of underwear and not wearing it is gross. But if the daughter isn't wearing other undergarments (like a shirt with layers), maybe the bra isn't necessary. The mother's comments about boys and femininity could be projecting her own expectations or insecurities, which the author rightly points out. The author's discomfort and the parents' punishment for not wearing a bra might be an issue of autonomy versus parental control.\n\nThe author's argument is that her body doesn't require a bra, and her parents are imposing unnecessary standards. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender roles, which the author resists. The author's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities is a strong point, suggesting the conflict isn't just about the bra but deeper issues.\n\nLegally and ethically, minors have some rights to autonomy, especially regarding their bodies, but parents do have a role in guiding their children's behavior. However, the parents' approach here seems punitive and based on body image issues, which might be overstepping. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and comfort, which is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are enforcing norms that don't fit the daughter's physical reality and are using emotional manipulation. Hence, answer B.\n"
