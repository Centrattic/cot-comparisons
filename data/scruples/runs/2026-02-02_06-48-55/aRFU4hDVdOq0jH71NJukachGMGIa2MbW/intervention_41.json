Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup, maybe even smaller), and describes herself as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents, especially her mom, are pushing her to wear a bra, saying it's about modesty and being feminine. They even punish her by not letting her leave the house without one. The mom comments on wanting boys to like her and that she's being lazy. The author lost her temper, told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities, and the mom cried. The author feels her mom is disappointed she's not more \"popular\" or feminine.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, cultural norms often dictate that women should wear bras in public for modesty and social expectations. Parents might feel they have a right to enforce such norms, especially for a minor. The mom's concern could stem from wanting her daughter to be accepted or to follow societal standards. However, the author's reasoning is that since she's very small-busted, bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable. She's also not interested in conforming to traditional femininity, which is her personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's approach seems to be pushing her daughter to conform to standards that may not apply to her. The argument that it's about support and modesty is weakened when there's nothing to support. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her daughter or her disappointment in her daughter's appearance could be seen as pressuring her to fit into a certain mold, which might be harmful. The punishment (not letting her leave without a bra) is a form of control that might infringe on the daughter's autonomy, especially if the daughter is comfortable and confident in her choice.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable. She's being made to feel bad about her body, which is a common issue. The mom's reaction\u2014crying and projecting insecurities\u2014suggests that the mom's issues might be fueling the conflict rather than the daughter's actual actions. The daughter's right to make her own decisions about her body, especially regarding clothing, is a significant point here.\n\nConsidering all this, the key factors are autonomy, comfort, and the mom's pressure. The author's choice to not wear a bra because she's physically unable to wear a proper size and finds it unnecessary seems valid. The mom's insistence may be overstepping, especially given the daughter's age and her personal preferences. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
