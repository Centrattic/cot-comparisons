Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size (A-cup), who identifies as tomboyish and isn't interested in fashion or dating. She doesn't wear a bra because she finds it uncomfortable and unnecessary, given her size. Her parents, especially her mother, believe that not wearing a bra is improper and insist she wear one, even when it's not visible. They comment on her appearance, suggesting she should be more feminine to attract boys, which she finds inappropriate and projecting their own insecurities.\n\nThe core issue here is about personal autonomy versus parental expectations. The parents see wearing a bra as a standard for modesty or femininity, while the daughter sees it as an unnecessary and uncomfortable requirement that doesn't align with her body or identity. The daughter's frustration stems from feeling pressured to conform to societal norms that she doesn't personally agree with, especially when her physical attributes don't necessitate a bra for support or modesty.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, societal norms often dictate that bras are standard for women, but these norms can be restrictive and not consider individual differences. The daughter's position is about self-acceptance and comfort, which is valid. The parents, on the other hand, are enforcing their views, possibly projecting their own insecurities or societal pressures onto their daughter. The daughter's outburst, while harsh, was in response to what she perceives as invalidation and pressure, which might be a result of ongoing tension.\n\nConsidering all this, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's not necessary for her body type and when it causes her discomfort. The parents might need to adjust their expectations to respect her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
