Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old girl who's not wearing a bra because she's an A-cup and finds it uncomfortable. Her parents are insisting she wears one, saying it's necessary for modesty and femininity. The girl feels that since she's flat-chested, there's no need, and her mom seems to have body image issues projecting onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many places, especially more conservative ones, not wearing a bra might be seen as immodest. But the girl argues that she's physically not the type to need support, so it's unnecessary. Also, she's tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating, so the pressure to conform to feminine standards might be a key point here.\n\nThe parents' argument is about modesty and being presentable. But the daughter is in a situation where she's not causing harm or being a nuisance. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pushing the daughter to conform to societal expectations that the daughter doesn't agree with. The daughter's response, though heated, seems to be about asserting her autonomy over her body.\n\nLegal and ethical angles: At 17, she's a minor, so parents have some authority over their child's appearance, especially regarding public behavior. However, the mother's reactions seem extreme\u2014yelling, preventing her from leaving the house, and making emotional comments. The daughter's refusal could be about personal comfort and self-image versus parental control. \n\nThere's also the issue of the mother projecting her own insecurities, as the daughter mentions. If the mother is using her own body image issues to pressure her daughter, that's a problem. The daughter's right to her own body image is important here. Since she's not causing harm, the question is whether the parents' rules are overstepping.\n\nIn terms of societal logic, bras are often about support and modesty. For someone with a small bust, the support might not be necessary. Modesty is more about cultural norms, but if the daughter is dressing appropriately (like wearing layers) and no one else is commenting on her lack of a bra, maybe the parents' concern is unfounded.\n\nThe key points are autonomy, parental overreach, and the daughter's comfort vs. societal expectations. The daughter isn't harming others, and the parents are using emotional manipulation. The mother's behavior seems to be the problem here. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
