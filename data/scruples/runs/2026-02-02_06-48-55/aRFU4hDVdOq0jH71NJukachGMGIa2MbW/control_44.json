Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author being 17, with a very small chest size, and finding bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are pressuring the author to wear a bra, even threatening to not let them leave the house, and making comments about wanting to be more feminine. The author feels that their mom is projecting her own body image issues onto them and that the mom is disappointed because the author isn't the type of daughter she wanted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're a teenager with a small chest size, so a bra might not be necessary for support or modesty in the same way it is for someone with a larger size. The author is comfortable not wearing a bra and doesn't feel it's needed. They also feel that their mother's comments are inappropriate and that the mother is trying to push her own insecurities onto the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents argue that a bra is underwear and necessary for modesty. They might be coming from a place of traditional values, where certain clothing is expected for women. The mother's comments about boys liking the author and being more feminine suggest that she's concerned about the daughter's attractiveness or societal expectations. However, the mother's approach seems to be controlling and possibly harmful, using punishment like not allowing the daughter to leave the house without a bra.\n\nThe key points here are the author's autonomy in making decisions about their own body, the parents' overreach in controlling their daughter's choices, and the emotional impact on both sides. The author is asserting their right to not wear a bra, which is a personal choice, especially when it's not necessary for them. The parents' reaction seems to be based on their own expectations and possibly their own insecurities, rather than the daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and individual choice, which would support the author's stance. However, the parents might be adhering to more traditional views. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. Since the author's decision is based on their own comfort and the fact that they don't need a bra for support or modesty, and the parents are enforcing a rule that's causing emotional distress, it seems that the parents are overstepping.\n\nThe author's response, although harsh, was in the heat of the moment and was a reaction to the mother's perceived overreach. The mother's actions of sending unsolicited videos and making the daughter feel bad about her body are problematic. The daughter is standing up for her right to be comfortable in her own skin, which is a valid choice.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The parents are the ones pressuring their daughter to conform to their expectations, which may not be appropriate given the daughter's physical and personal circumstances.\n"
