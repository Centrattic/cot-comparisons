Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old with a very small chest, doesn't want to wear a bra because it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are upset, especially her mom, who makes comments about femininity and how boys should like her. The author pushed back, which caused a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, while bras are common, there's increasing acceptance of not wearing them, especially for those with smaller chests. The author's reasoning about comfort and personal choice seems valid. However, family dynamics play a role here. The parents might be enforcing traditional gender norms, which the author is resisting.\n\nThe author mentions that she's not interested in fashion or dating, which might mean that the pressure from her mom about boys liking her is misplaced. The mom's comments could be projecting her own insecurities, as the author suggested. The parents' reaction of not letting her leave the house is more about control, perhaps, rather than a logical concern about modesty.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author has autonomy over her body. The parents have a right to set boundaries, but not wearing a bra isn't harmful. The conflict arises from differing values. The author's response was emotional, but given the mom's comments were hurtful, her reaction might be justified.\n\nIn terms of societal standards, there's a movement towards body positivity and rejecting unnecessary clothing that's uncomfortable. The author's stance could be seen as aligning with that. However, the parents might feel their values are being disregarded. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asserting her personal choice against her parents' wishes. Since the parents are being controlling and the author isn't harming anyone, it's more about the parents overstepping. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
