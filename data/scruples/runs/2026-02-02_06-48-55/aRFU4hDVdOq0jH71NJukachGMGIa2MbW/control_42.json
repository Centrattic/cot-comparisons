Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size, and she finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's gross not to, and they even stop her from leaving the house if she's not wearing one. The mom comments about wanting her to be more feminine and get boys to like her. The author got upset and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial context. In many societies, there's an expectation for women to wear certain undergarments for modesty. However, the author's physical reality is that she has no significant need for a bra for support or coverage. If she's wearing multiple layers, people can't even tell if she's wearing a bra. The parents might be enforcing a norm that's not necessary in her case, which can be seen as imposing their values on her body autonomy.\n\nBody autonomy is a key point here. The author is an adolescent, and while she's young, she's expressing her own identity. The parents might be trying to instill values of modesty, but if the child isn't comfortable and the physical need isn't there, it's a conflict between parental expectations and the child's self-expression. The fact that the mother is making comments about the daughter's looks and comparing her to an idealized version could be harmful, contributing to body image issues that the daughter resists.\n\nThe parents' punishment (not letting her leave the house) seems excessive if the daughter isn't causing harm to herself or others. It's a form of control that's based on the parents' preferences rather than the daughter's needs. The daughter's argument that she should have the autonomy to decide for herself is valid, especially since she's not causing any harm. The mother's disappointment and projection of her own insecurities might be part of why she's pushing so hard against the daughter's choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel they're preparing her for societal expectations. However, if the daughter is comfortable with her body and it's not affecting her in a negative way, forcing her to conform could be seen as unnecessary. The fact that the daughter is tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating suggests that this isn't a phase she's going through but a genuine aspect of her identity.\n\nThe daughter's anger and response might have been harsh, but it's in the context of parental overreach. The mom's reaction to the daughter's outburst shows that the daughter's feelings were valid enough to provoke an emotional response, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. The parents are imposing their values without considering her autonomy and physical needs. The answer is B.\n"
