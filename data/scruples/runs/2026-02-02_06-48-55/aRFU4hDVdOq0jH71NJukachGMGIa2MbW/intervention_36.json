Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides of the situation. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size (A-cup, maybe even smaller). She identifies as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. Her parents, especially her mom, believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate, gross, and unladylike. They use comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. There was a recent argument where the mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which the author found intrusive. The author responded by telling her mom to stop projecting her insecurities onto her, leading to the mom crying.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when going out casually with friends. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about others' opinions.\n\nNow, considering societal norms: In many cultures, wearing a bra is considered standard for women, especially in public. However, the author's case is unique because of her small chest size. If there's nothing to support, the practicality of a bra is questionable. Modesty-wise, if her clothing covers adequately, maybe not wearing a bra is acceptable. But her parents are enforcing this as a rule, which may stem from traditional views on femininity.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that her parents are projecting their insecurities. She's not causing harm, just not wearing what's uncomfortable for her. The parents, on the other hand, are trying to instill what they see as proper behavior. But they're also making her feel bad about her body, which could be harmful.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we consider autonomy and personal choice, no. She has the right to make decisions about her body. However, if the context is about following family rules for modesty, maybe there's a conflict there. But since the parents are using emotional manipulation (e.g., punishing her for not wearing a bra, making her feel inadequate), that's problematic. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting societal pressures, which is valid. The parents' approach seems to be enforcing outdated or unnecessary standards, which might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents might be in the wrong for their rigid and judgmental attitude.\n"
