Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl not wearing a bra, and her parents are upset about it. The user is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions she's a tomboy, studious, not interested in fashion or dating. She has a very small chest size (A-cup, but she says she's barely that), so from her perspective, a bra might not be necessary for support. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, which makes sense if she's not getting much support from them. The parents, on the other hand, believe bras are a form of underwear, so not wearing one is considered gross. They use phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" which seems more about societal expectations than actual modesty or support. The author is upset because her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nNow, from a cultural standpoint, in many Western societies, wearing a bra is often seen as required for modesty in public. However, the author is arguing that since she's so flat-chested, it's unnecessary. There's also the aspect of parental control versus personal autonomy. The parents are enforcing a rule that's causing emotional distress. The author is pushing back against what she sees as unrealistic expectations, especially since her mom is criticizing her for being too boyish or not feminine enough. The mom's comments about boys liking her or being ungrateful seem to be pressuring her to conform to a certain image.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' control over her ability to leave the house based on this issue and the emotional manipulation. The author is standing up for her body autonomy, which is important. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal perspective, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. The conflict is more about family dynamics and personal beliefs.\n\nThe parents might be coming from a place of traditional views on feminine appearance, but their approach is causing harm. The author's response, while heated, was defending her right to be comfortable in her own skin. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the parent's behavior and the author's valid reasons, maybe the parents are the ones out of line. The author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra, especially when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the conflict stems more from the parents' expectations than the author's actions.\n"
