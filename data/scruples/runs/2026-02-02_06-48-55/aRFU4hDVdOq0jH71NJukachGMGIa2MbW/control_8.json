Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds it uncomfortable. Her parents are pushing her to wear one, saying it's necessary, and even threatening not to let her leave the house if she doesn't. The daughter is getting upset because her mom comments on her body and seems disappointed in her for being tomboyish and flat-chested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The daughter's perspective is that she's comfortable not wearing a bra, especially since she's barely an A-cup and there's little to support. She feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the pressure is unnecessary. The parents, on the other hand, believe that a bra is underwear and thus should be worn, similar to other undergarments, for modesty and hygiene. They might also be trying to encourage her to be more \"feminine,\" which the daughter resists.\n\nLooking at societal norms, in many Western cultures, wearing a bra is often considered a social expectation for women, even if the reason can be as simple as modesty. However, the daughter is in a situation where it's not a significant issue because of her small size. The parents might be enforcing a rule that's more about their expectations than actual necessity. The daughter's refusal could be seen as challenging these norms, but since she's a minor, the parents might argue they have the authority to set such rules.\n\nBut the parent's approach seems problematic. Using phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" or implying she's being lazy suggests that their reasons might be more about their own desires for her to conform to traditional femininity rather than genuine health or safety concerns. The daughter's response about her mom projecting insecurities and the emotional reaction might indicate that the parent's motivations are less about the daughter's well-being and more about their own dissatisfaction.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to set household rules, but if those rules are based on unhealthy or controlling motives, it's a different story. The daughter is within her rights to feel that her body autonomy is being violated. However, as a minor, she might not have the full legal authority to make this decision without parental consent, especially if there are cultural or family expectations involved.\n\nIn terms of the question, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) to enforce a rule that's not harmful, then the parents might be overstepping. The daughter's choice not to wear a bra in her case is a personal preference and doesn't harm anyone. The parents' reaction, especially the mother's emotional outbursts and comments, could suggest that their enforcement is more about their own issues than the daughter's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's comfortable for her and there's no real necessity. The parents are enforcing a rule that doesn't apply to her situation and are using emotional manipulation, which is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
