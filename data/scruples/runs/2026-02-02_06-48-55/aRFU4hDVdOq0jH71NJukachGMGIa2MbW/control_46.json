Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. They\u2019re 17, have a very small chest (A-cup), consider themselves tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. The parents insist on wearing a bra as underwear, with the mother making comments about boys liking them and being more feminine. The daughter feels bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable, and the mother's behavior is inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, while it's common for women to wear bras, it's not a legal requirement or a universal expectation, especially for those with small chests. The daughter's argument that modesty isn't an issue since she's an A-cup and that support isn't necessary because of her size seems valid. Comfort is a personal choice, so if she's comfortable without a bra, that's her right.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is based on their view of societal norms and perhaps their own expectations. However, the mother's comments about boys liking her and being ungrateful seem to pressure the daughter into conforming to traditional feminine standards, which might not be healthy, especially for a teenager. The father's stance isn't as detailed, but the main issue is the mother's behavior.\n\nThe daughter lashed out, accusing her mom of projecting insecurities. The mom cried, which makes the daughter feel bad. But the daughter's response was during an argument, so maybe it was an emotional reaction. The key here is whether the daughter is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, not the argument itself. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the daughter is making a personal choice about her body. The parents are trying to enforce their views, which could be seen as overstepping, especially if they\u2019re punishing her for not wearing a bra. There's a lack of respect for her autonomy. However, there's a cultural expectation that might influence this. But given her age and the fact that she's in a country where such choices are considered personal, the parents' insistence might be more about control than actual necessity.\n\nAlso, the mother's comments about boys liking her and her body image could be contributing to the daughter's discomfort. The daughter's stance is about being true to herself. So, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to choose what she wears based on her comfort and body type. The parents are imposing their norms, which may not be appropriate for a teenager's autonomy.\n"
