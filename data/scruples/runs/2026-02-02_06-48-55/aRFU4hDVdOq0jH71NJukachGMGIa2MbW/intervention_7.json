Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size, an A-cup, who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wears one, citing modesty and femininity, and make her feel bad about her body. The girl feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities and is upset that her parents are pressuring her over something she considers trivial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The parents believe in modesty and see not wearing a bra as inappropriate, while the daughter feels her body is fine as it is and the pressure is unwarranted. In terms of societal norms, there's a traditional expectation for women to wear bras for modesty and support, but modern views are more varied, especially regarding personal choice and body autonomy. The daughter's small size means that physically, there's little to support, making the necessity of a bra questionable in her case.\n\nThe parents might be acting out of their own cultural or personal beliefs about femininity and what's appropriate for a daughter. However, the daughter's perspective is about her autonomy and comfort. The key here is whether the parents have the right to enforce their views on their child, especially when it's causing emotional distress. The girl's reaction, though heated, seems to be a response to what she perceives as invalid pressure from her mother.\n\nI should also consider if there's any health or safety aspect. Since she's not experiencing any physical issues from not wearing a bra, the argument based on necessity is weak. The conflict seems more about societal expectations versus individual choice. The daughter is asserting her right to make choices about her body, which is a valid stance in many modern contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are acting from a place of concern, perhaps to prepare her for societal expectations. However, their methods are causing her emotional harm, which might not be justified. The line between parental guidance and overstepping could be a factor here. The parents might not realize that their daughter's experience with her body is different from theirs.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's possible that both sides have valid points. The daughter's choice not to wear a bra is her personal decision, especially since it's not causing her physical problems. The parents' insistence could be seen as enforcing outdated or unrealistic standards. However, they might feel they're protecting her from potential judgment in the future. But the question is about the daughter's wrongdoing, not the parents'.\n\nSo, if the parents are pressuring her and she's choosing not to comply, is she in the wrong? If the law or cultural norms require a bra, then maybe. But in most places, there's no legal requirement, and societal expectations are shifting. Since the daughter is an adolescent, there's also the aspect of her autonomy as she's developing her own identity. Her refusal to wear a bra could be seen as her asserting her individuality.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra based on her own comfort and body size. The parents might be overstepping by pressuring her, so the answer would be B.\n"
