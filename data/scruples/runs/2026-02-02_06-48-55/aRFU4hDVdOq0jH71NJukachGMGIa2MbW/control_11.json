Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest, identifying as tomboyish and not interested in fashion or dating. The parents insist on wearing a bra, considering it necessary for modesty and femininity, and they enforce this by not letting the author leave the house without one. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since they don't have a large bust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might believe that wearing a bra is a standard part of being a girl, tied to societal norms around modesty and femininity. They might also be projecting their own expectations onto the author, perhaps wanting her to conform to traditional gender roles. However, the author feels that their criticism is misplaced, especially since they have a small chest and find bras unnecessary. The mother's comments about boys liking her and the author's flat-chestedness could be contributing to the author's frustration.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they are asserting their autonomy over their own body. They feel that their parents are imposing their own body image insecurities onto them. The author is rejecting societal standards that prioritize certain physical attributes and is choosing to be comfortable in their own skin. This is a valid stance, as bodily autonomy and personal comfort are important, especially during adolescence when identity is being formed.\n\nLegally, there's no law requiring the wearing of a bra, so the author isn't breaking any rules. Socially, attitudes are changing towards body positivity and individual choice regarding clothing. However, the parents' rules are part of their household dynamics, and the conflict arises from differing values. The author is in a tough spot, trying to balance parental expectations with their own sense of self.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to make personal choices about their body and the parents' right to set household rules. While the parents have the authority to set certain standards, they also need to consider the child's comfort and autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra if that's their personal choice, especially when the necessity is questionable due to their small chest. The parents, on the other hand, might need to adjust their expectations and respect the author's autonomy as they grow into adulthood.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
