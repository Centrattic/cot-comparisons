Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is 17, has a very small chest (barely an A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's necessary for modesty and femininity. The mom even comments about wanting boys to like her and the author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a teenager forming her own identity, and she's not interested in conforming to traditional feminine standards. She's comfortable with her body and doesn't feel the need to wear a bra because she doesn't have much to support. The discomfort with bras is a valid point too\u2014many people find them uncomfortable, especially when they're not needed for support.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are coming from a place of societal norms and expectations. They might believe that wearing a bra is a standard of modesty and femininity. However, the mom's comments about boys liking her and implying that not wearing a bra makes her look like a boy could be seen as pushing her own desires onto the daughter. The parent's reaction of not letting her leave the house seems over the top and controlling. The author's outburst, while harsh, might be a result of built-up frustration from being pressured in a way that doesn't respect her autonomy.\n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong with not wearing a bra in public; it's a personal choice and not against the law. However, societal norms can influence what's considered acceptable. But when it comes to parental control over a 17-year-old, there's a balance between guidance and respecting the child's autonomy. The mom's actions seem to be more about her own expectations and possibly her insecurities rather than the daughter's well-being.\n\nThe author's argument that she's not being disrespectful and that her body is her own seems valid. The mom's pressure might be contributing to body image issues in the daughter, even if unintentionally. The fact that the author is comfortable in her own skin and the bras are unnecessary for her size strengthens her position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have their reasons based on societal norms, the author's choice to not wear a bra is her personal decision and not inherently wrong. The parents' overreaction and lack of respect for her autonomy are more problematic. So the answer should be B.\n"
