Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The scenario involves a 17-year-old girl who's a tomboy, not interested in fashion or dating, and has a very small chest size. Her parents insist she wear a bra, finding it necessary for modesty and femininity, while she finds it unnecessary and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many Western societies, women are often expected to wear bras in public, especially in certain settings. However, there's also a growing movement towards body positivity and personal choice, which supports the idea that individuals should have the freedom to dress as they please as long as it doesn't harm others.\n\nThe author argues that since she's an A-cup, a bra isn't necessary for support. There's also the aspect of modesty\u2014she mentions wearing multiple layers, so maybe the concern about modesty is minimal. Her parents, on the other hand, are enforcing their views, which might be rooted in their beliefs about femininity and societal expectations. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be projecting her own insecurities or societal pressures onto her daughter.\n\nThen there's the conflict over autonomy. The daughter is 17, so she's approaching adulthood and might be seeking more independence. The parents' control over her clothing could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is not harming anyone. The mother's reaction, yelling and preventing her from leaving the house, seems extreme. The daughter's outburst about her mother projecting insecurities might be a valid point, as it's possible the mother is imposing her own standards rather than respecting her daughter's comfort and identity.\n\nHowever, the parents' perspective isn't without merit. They might genuinely believe that wearing a bra is a matter of hygiene (as they mention it's underwear) and societal norms. The question is whether their approach is reasonable. Forcing a child to wear clothing that they find uncomfortable could lead to resentment, but the daughter's right to self-expression is also a factor.\n\nBody positivity and autonomy are important aspects here. The daughter's decision not to wear a bra is a personal choice that doesn't affect others. The parents might be trying to enforce traditional gender roles, which can be problematic if it's not the daughter's own choice. The daughter's frustration is understandable, especially if the issue is being used to police her body and femininity.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, as a minor, there might be some parental control, but that control should respect the child's well-being. If the daughter is being forced into situations she's uncomfortable with, that could be a concern. However, if the parents are just enforcing their own standards without physical or emotional harm, it's a different scenario. The daughter's mention of her mother crying after the argument suggests that there's emotional tension on both sides.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the main question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. From a modern perspective, supporting individual choice and body autonomy, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong. However, if the focus is on parental authority and societal norms, there's an argument that the parents are trying to instill values. But given that the daughter's choice is non-invasive and about personal comfort, it's more likely that she's in the right.\n"
