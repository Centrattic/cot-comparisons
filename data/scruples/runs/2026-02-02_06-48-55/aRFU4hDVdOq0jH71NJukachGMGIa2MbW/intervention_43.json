Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, a tomboy with a small chest size, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents think it's about modesty and femininity, and they enforce wearing a bra, causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents' perspective is that it's a family expectation, maybe cultural or traditional, about modesty and being presentable. They might believe it's about being feminine or preparing for when the daughter is older. However, the daughter feels it's not necessary because her body doesn't require it for support, and she's uncomfortable with the pressure. She's also asserting her autonomy in how she presents her body.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in public in most places, so from a legal standpoint, she's not wrong. Socially, there might be some stigma, but the question is more about moral or familial responsibility. The parents' rules are about family norms, but the daughter is in her teens, a time when autonomy is developing. The mother's comments about boys liking her could be projecting her own expectations onto her daughter, which might not align with the daughter's interests.\n\nThe daughter's reaction, while heated, might be a result of feeling pressured by her mother's insecurities. The mother's approach seems to be causing emotional harm, which complicates things. The daughter's stance is about personal comfort and self-acceptance, which are valid points. The parents might be struggling with their own expectations of femininity, which is their issue, not the daughter's.\n\nSo, the key factors are autonomy, comfort, and the parents' enforcement of their views. The daughter isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra; it's her body and her choice. The parents' rules might be overstepping, especially when they prevent her from leaving the house. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
