Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 17, has a very small bust, and finds bras uncomfortable. Her parents insist she wears one, citing modesty and femininity. They even prevent her from leaving the house without it. The mother makes comments about looking more feminine and the author feels it's a projection of the mother's insecurities. The author snapped, telling her mom to stop projecting, and the mom cried. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, bras are typically expected for modesty and support, especially in public settings. However, the author's situation is unique. She has a very small chest, so support might not be an issue, and modesty could be achieved with other clothing layers. The parents are imposing their views on femininity, which the author resists. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pressuring the author into a standard she doesn't agree with. The author is asserting her autonomy in body choices, which is a valid point. There's also the aspect of parental control vs. personal choice. At 17, the author is still a minor, so parents might feel they have authority over her. But pressuring her on such a personal issue could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing emotional distress.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents can set rules for minors, but there's a line when it comes to mental health and autonomy. However, this isn't a legal question, more about right and wrong. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, and the mother is making personal choices about her daughter's body. The author's defense is about self-acceptance and not conforming to societal expectations, which is a valid stance. On the other hand, the parents are coming from a place of concern for modesty and social norms, which they might see as important.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harmful or disrespectful. Since she's not causing harm and is expressing her identity, it's more about personal choice. The mother's reaction might be overbearing. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra if that's her preference and there's no health or safety issue. The mother's insistence could be more about her own expectations rather than the daughter's needs. So, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
