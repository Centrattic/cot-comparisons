Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation described. The question is whether the answer should be A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup or less), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. They describe their parents, especially their mom, pressuring them to wear a bra, making comments about being more feminine, and even punishing them by not letting them leave the house if they don't wear one. The author feels that this pressure is unwarranted because their body doesn't require support, and they feel their mom is projecting her own insecurities onto them. The author also mentions losing their temper and saying hurtful things, which caused their mom to cry.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are autonomy, body image, and cultural expectations. The author is asserting their right to make personal choices about their body. They feel that their parents are imposing arbitrary standards of femininity and modesty on them, which they don't agree with. The parents, on the other hand, believe that wearing a bra is a necessary part of being feminine and that not doing so is inappropriate.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they wear on their bodies without judgment. The author's choice not to wear a bra, especially given their physical characteristics (small bust), is a personal decision that doesn't harm others. The parents' reaction seems to stem from outdated or culturally ingrained beliefs about femininity, which may not align with the author's personal identity and comfort.\n\nHowever, the situation is also complicated by the power dynamics in a parent-child relationship. The parents are enforcing rules and using punishment (not letting the author leave the house) to control their child's behavior. This raises ethical questions about autonomy and respect for the child's choices as they approach adulthood. The author is at an age where they're developing their own identity, and the pressure from parents to conform to certain standards might be seen as overbearing.\n\nThe author's frustration leading to a heated argument and hurtful comments is a point to consider. While the statement about projecting insecurities might be harsh, it's in the heat of the moment and could be a reaction to long-standing pressure. The mom's emotional response (crying) suggests that the argument was hurtful, but the root issue is the ongoing conflict over body image and autonomy.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law that requires wearing a bra, and personal choice in clothing is a fundamental right. The parents' stance that it's \"gross\" or \"unladylike\" is subjective and doesn't hold objective validity. The author's discomfort with bras and their physical necessity (or lack thereof) is a personal factor that should be respected.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The pressure from the parents is unwarranted, and the author's right to bodily autonomy and personal choice should be upheld. The conflict arises from differing values, but the key factor is the author's right to make decisions about their own body based on their comfort and identity.\n"
