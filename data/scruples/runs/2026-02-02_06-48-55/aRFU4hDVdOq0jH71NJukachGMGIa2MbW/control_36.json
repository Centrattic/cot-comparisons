Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl who's a tomboy with a very small bust size. Her parents, especially her mom, are insisting she wear a bra, making comments about being feminine and boys liking her, and even punishing her by not letting her leave the house without one. The girl finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she doesn't have much to support. She had a recent argument where she snapped back, saying her mom was projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girl's perspective. She's a minor, so her parents have some authority over her. However, the pressure to conform to certain feminine standards is a big issue here. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be trying to push her into a mold she doesn't want to fit. The girl is clear she's not interested in fashion or dating, which adds context. The mom's reactions seem to be more about her own expectations or societal pressures rather than the girl's actual needs or comfort.\n\nFrom the mom's side, she's coming from a place of concern for her daughter's future and societal norms. But the way she's enforcing it\u2014controlling her freedom to leave the house and making personal comments\u2014could be overstepping. The girl is within her rights to feel that her body autonomy is important, especially when the parent's reasons don't align with her own comfort and reality.\n\nThe girl's argument is that since she has a very small bust, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. That's a valid point. Many people with smaller chests don't wear bras for comfort and practicality. The mom's insistence might stem from her own body image issues, as the girl suggested, which complicates things. The punishment (not letting her leave without a bra) is a form of control that might not be justified if the daughter isn't harming anyone.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's been a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that people should be comfortable in their own skin. The pressure to wear a bra is decreasing in many circles, especially for those who don't need it. The girl's stance is about not wanting to be forced into societal expectations that don't fit her lifestyle or physical reality.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether she's violating any social norms or the parent's reasonable authority. Since she's a minor, parents do have some say, but there's a balance between their expectations and the child's autonomy. The mom's approach seems harsh and focused on changing the daughter's identity rather than respecting her comfort and self-perception. The girl isn't hurting anyone by not wearing a bra, and the mom's reactions are more about her own insecurities than the daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her decision is based on her physical needs and comfort, and the parent's reactions are overbearing and based on unrealistic expectations. The girl is asserting her right to her body and identity, which is valid and not in the wrong.\n"
