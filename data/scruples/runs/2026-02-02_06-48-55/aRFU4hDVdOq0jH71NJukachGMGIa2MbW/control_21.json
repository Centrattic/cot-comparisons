Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl who's a small-busted, tomboyish, and studious. Her parents believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and make her wear one, while she finds it uncomfortable and unnecessary. The key points here are the author's body type, her parents' expectations, and the conflict over personal choice versus parental authority.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is often seen as standard for modesty and support, but there's also a growing movement advocating for body positivity and personal choice. The author's argument is that since she's a small-busted, bras are unnecessary for her, which makes sense. If she's in a culture where this is more accepted, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, her parents are enforcing their views, which might be based on traditional values.\n\nNext, the author's perspective: she feels her parents are projecting their own insecurities onto her and that her mother is disappointed in her for not being more conventionally feminine. She also mentions that others don't care about her not wearing a bra, implying that the conflict is primarily within her household. This suggests that the issue is more about her parents' expectations rather than societal judgment.\n\nThe parents' side: They believe bras are necessary as underwear for modesty. Their concern might stem from a desire to prepare her for societal norms, but their approach is authoritarian, not letting her leave the house without one and making hurtful comments. The fact that they yell and punish her could indicate that their methods are overbearing and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In most places, the age of majority is 18, so at 17, the author is still under her parents' care. However, the right to bodily autonomy is a growing topic. While parents have the right to set household rules, there's a line when it comes to mental health and personal choice. The parents might be overstepping by using emotional manipulation and punishment, which could be harmful.\n\nThe author's response in the conflict was to confront her mother, leading to emotional distress. While her words were harsh, they were a reaction to what she perceives as unfair treatment. The question is whether her actions were justified. Since she's asserting her right to make her own choices about her body, especially when others don't judge her, it could be seen as reasonable. However, the way she expressed her frustration might have been inappropriate, but the core issue isn't about her choice to not wear a bra but her parents' enforcement of it.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: The parents are enforcing a rule that's not necessary for the author's comfort or societal norms, using emotional abuse. The author is standing up for her autonomy, which is a valid stance. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
