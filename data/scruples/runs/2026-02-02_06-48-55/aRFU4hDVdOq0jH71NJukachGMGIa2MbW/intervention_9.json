Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is a 17-year-old girl who's very tomboyish, studious, and not interested in fashion or dating. She has a very small bust, like an A-cup or even smaller. Her parents believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and part of the family's rules. They get upset if she doesn't wear one, even using comments about boys liking her and being more feminine. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because she barely has anything to support. She had a recent argument where she said her mom is projecting her own body image issues, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points here. The parents are enforcing a rule about wearing a bra, which is their household's policy. The daughter is resisting because of her own comfort and body image. The parents are using emotional and possibly controlling tactics, like not letting her leave the house without a bra and making comments about her femininity. The daughter feels that the parents are being unreasonable given her small size and her personal preferences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, the parents are trying to enforce their values, which might be about modesty or societal norms. On the other, the daughter is asserting her autonomy and comfort. The key here is whether the daughter is violating any reasonable expectations or if the parents are overstepping.\n\nThe daughter argues that her small size makes bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. There's also a power dynamic here\u2014parents have authority over their children until a certain age. However, the daughter is 17, almost an adult, and the issue is about personal choice and body autonomy. The parents' comments about boys liking her and her being more feminine could be seen as pressuring her to conform to beauty standards, which might not be healthy.\n\nThe daughter's response, while harsh, was in the heat of the moment. She called her mom out for projecting insecurities, which might be justified if the mom is indeed pushing her own ideals. The question is whether the daughter is wrong for not complying with the parents' rule. Since the rule is based on discomfort and the daughter's small size, it's possible that the parents are being unreasonable. Also, the daughter is making a valid point about body acceptance.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, in many places, wearing a bra is optional and depends on personal preference, especially for those with small chests. The parents' insistence could be seen as unnecessary. However, if this is a family rule, the daughter might be in the wrong for not following it, but the parents' approach seems problematic.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the daughter is asserting her autonomy, which is important. The parents are being controlling and pushing gendered expectations. The daughter isn't in the wrong here because she's choosing what's comfortable for her body, especially when there's little need for a bra. The parents' reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
