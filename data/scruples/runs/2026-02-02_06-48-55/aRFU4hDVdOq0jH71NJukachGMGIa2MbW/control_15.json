Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a barely A-cup, identifies as tomboyish, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because their chest is very small. Their parents, especially the mom, believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and even gross, using phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" and \"you should be more feminine.\" The mom also yells and withholds permission to leave the house if the author doesn't wear a bra. There was an incident where the author went out without a bra accidentally, and the mom was upset. The author responded to a video sent by their mom with frustration, leading to a heated argument where the mom cried.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's personal comfort and identity versus the parents' expectations based on traditional views of femininity. The author's mom seems to be pushing for the daughter to conform to certain beauty standards, possibly projecting her own insecurities. The author feels that their mom is being hypocritical or projecting her own issues, and that there's no real reason to wear a bra since their chest is so small. The author is also asserting their autonomy in how they present their body.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, wearing a bra is often seen as a matter of personal choice, especially when it comes to modesty and comfort. For someone with a very small chest, a bra might not be necessary for support, so the author's decision not to wear one could be reasonable. The parents' insistence might stem from traditional gender roles, but the daughter is challenging those by asserting her identity and comfort.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The answer would depend on whether there's a valid reason for the parents' stance. If the parents are enforcing this for reasons of personal comfort or modesty, and the author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if there are cultural or religious reasons that require wearing a bra, that could be different, but the situation doesn't mention that. The parents' arguments seem to be based on societal expectations and their own dissatisfaction, not on the author's well-being.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the mom's video, while perhaps harsh, was in a moment of frustration. The mom's actions of sending the video and making the author feel bad about their body might have contributed to the conflict. The author is standing up for their own body image and autonomy, which is a valid stance.\n\nIn terms of the actual question, the choice is between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author is making a personal choice about their body, especially when their physical need for a bra isn't there, and the parents are imposing their views without valid reasons, the author isn't in the wrong. The focus on the author's small chest and their right to feel comfortable in their own skin seems to support answer B.\n"
