Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mother, are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and femininity, and even punishing her when she doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but this isn't a universal rule. The author's reasoning is that since she's an A-cup, a bra isn't necessary, and she's not interested in conforming to traditional feminine standards. Her mother's reaction seems to stem from her own expectations and maybe insecurities about her daughter's appearance and femininity.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and body image. The author is asserting her right to choose what she wears on her body, especially since she feels the requirement is based on outdated or unnecessary standards. Her mother is enforcing her own views, which may not align with the daughter's comfort or identity. The argument about not wanting to project insecurities onto the daughter is valid; it's a common issue where parents impose their own standards on their children.\n\nHowever, the mother's concern about modesty and societal expectations might be rooted in cultural norms. But when it comes to personal choice, especially for an adolescent, the line between guidance and control is thin. The mother's punishment for not wearing a bra (not letting her leave the house) seems excessive, especially if the daughter isn't causing harm to herself or others.\n\nThe author's frustration with her mother's comments about boys liking her and her own body image suggests that the mother is pressuring her to conform to traditional feminine roles. The author's response, though heated, was a reaction to years of pressure, indicating that the mother's approach might be contributing to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother's actions could be considered overstepping, especially if she's using punishment to enforce her views. The daughter's choice to not wear a bra, based on her physical needs and personal identity, seems valid. However, the daughter's harsh words might have been unkind, but given the context of ongoing pressure, her reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about conflicting values and personal autonomy versus parental expectations. The mother's approach seems controlling and not respecting the daughter's autonomy, which is why the answer is B.\n"
