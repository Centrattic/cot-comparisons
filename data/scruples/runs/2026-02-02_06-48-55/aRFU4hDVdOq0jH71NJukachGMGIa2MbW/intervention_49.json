Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, a tomboy with a very small bust (A-cup, but maybe even smaller, like mosquito-bite-sized). They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents think it's gross not to wear one and link it to being more feminine and appealing to boys. The conflict arises from the parents' expectations versus the author's comfort and self-perception.\n\nFrom a personal autonomy perspective, the author has the right to make choices about their own body, especially as they're approaching adulthood. The parents are imposing their standards, which might not align with the author's identity. The author's reasoning that there's nothing to support with a small bust is valid; many people with small chests find bras unnecessary for support. Also, the mother's comments about boys liking her and her disappointment in the daughter's appearance could be projecting her own insecurities, as the author mentioned.\n\nModesty and societal norms vary, and in many casual settings, not wearing a bra, especially with layers, is acceptable. The parents' insistence on it being a requirement for leaving the house seems overly controlling. The author's frustration leading to an argument where they confront their mother about projecting insecurities is understandable, as the mother's behavior might be more about her own issues than the daughter's actual actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to self-expression and bodily autonomy. The parents' reactions are more about their expectations and possible insecurities rather than a legitimate issue with the author's choice. So, answer B.\n"
