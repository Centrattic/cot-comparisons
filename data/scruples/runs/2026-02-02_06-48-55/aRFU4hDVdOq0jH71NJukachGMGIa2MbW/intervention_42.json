Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small bust size, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wear one for modesty and femininity, leading to conflicts where they won't let her leave the house without it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's young, identifies as tomboyish, and doesn't care about fashion or dating. She argues that since she has a small chest, a bra isn't needed for support or modesty. Her parents' comments about wanting her to be more feminine and their disappointment are adding to her frustration. The author feels her body image is being policed, and she's defending her right to make her own choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are coming from a place of cultural or personal beliefs about modesty and femininity. They might feel they're preparing her for societal expectations. However, their approach of shaming and punishing her for not wearing a bra could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's not causing harm to others.\n\nI should think about autonomy here. The author is an adult in some regions, so she has the right to make decisions about her body. The parents' insistence might be infringing on her autonomy. Also, the mother's comments about wanting boys to like her and projecting her own insecurities could be problematic, as they're not respecting the daughter's self-image.\n\nAnother angle is the discomfort of bras. If they're uncomfortable and unnecessary for her body type, it's reasonable for her to avoid them. The parents' argument about modesty might not hold if her choice to not wear a bra isn't visible to others, as mentioned in the layers of clothing example.\n\nHowever, societal norms often vary. In many cultures, not wearing a bra in public might still be considered inappropriate, but the author argues that since she's not noticeable, it's not a problem. This could be a matter of personal versus societal expectations.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harming anyone. If she's comfortable and it's not affecting others, then her choice is hers. The parents' enforcement through punishment (not letting her leave) could be an issue of control rather than legitimate concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her autonomy over her body and rejecting societal pressures that don't align with her identity. The parents' reactions seem more about their own expectations and insecurities rather than the actual necessity of a bra for the author.\n"
