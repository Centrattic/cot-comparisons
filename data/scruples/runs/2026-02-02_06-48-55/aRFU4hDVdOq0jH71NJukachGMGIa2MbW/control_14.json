Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 17-year-old girl who's barely an A-cup and doesn't wear a bra. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's necessary for modesty and femininity. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since she doesn't have much of a bust. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The author snapped back, accusing her mom of projecting her own insecurities, and now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She's a teenager with a small bust, so she might not need a bra for support. Many people don't wear bras for comfort, especially if they don't need the support. The argument that bras are about modesty\u2014well, if no one can tell she's not wearing one, maybe the modesty aspect isn't an issue. Also, the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) over this, which seems extreme. The mother's comments about boys liking her and her femininity might be pushing a traditional gender role that the author isn't interested in. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might believe that wearing a bra is a standard part of dressing modestly for girls. They might feel that it's about hygiene (underwear as part of being clean) and social norms. But is that a valid reason when their daughter doesn't need it and finds it uncomfortable? The mother's reaction seems to be projecting her own desires onto her daughter, as the author mentioned. The daughter is clear about her body and her choices, which is her right. The parents are not respecting her autonomy here. \n\nAlso, the daughter's outburst was in the heat of the moment. She stood up for herself, which is understandable given the pressure. The mother crying might show that the conversation went too far, but the root of the problem is the mother's insistence on her daughter conforming to expectations she doesn't want to. \n\nSo, considering the arguments, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice that's comfortable for her body, and the parents are overstepping by making it a punishment and enforcing outdated gender norms. The answer should be B.\n"
