Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has an A-cup, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are upset about it and make her wear one, citing modesty and being unladylike. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that her mom is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, especially in Western ones, wearing a bra is considered standard for women, mainly for support and modesty. However, that's changing with more body positivity movements. The author is still young, so there's a generational aspect here. The parents might be enforcing traditional standards, while the daughter is more comfortable with a modern, body-positive view.\n\nBut the key points here are that the author is physically very small, an A-cup, so bras might indeed be unnecessary for support. The discomfort and the fact that her mom's comments are pressuring her to conform to certain beauty standards are significant. The author's response, while maybe harsh, seems to stem from feeling judged and not accepted for who she is. \n\nThe parents might believe they're teaching modesty and preparing her for societal expectations, but the author is asserting her autonomy over her body. The question is whether the author's choice is wrong. Since she's an adolescent, there's a balance between parental guidance and her right to make her own decisions. However, in this case, it seems like the parents are being overbearing, and the author's choice is reasonable given her physical attributes and personal comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong. The parents are enforcing a standard that's not necessary for her body type and are making her feel bad about her natural state, which is not appropriate. The author has the right to choose what she's comfortable with, especially since she's in a stage where she's developing her own identity.\n"
