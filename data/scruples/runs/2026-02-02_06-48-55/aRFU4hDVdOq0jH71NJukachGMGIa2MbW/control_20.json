Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the user is a 17-year-old girl who's very tomboyish, doesn't care about fashion or dating. She's an A-cup, which is very small. Her parents, especially her mom, are strict about her wearing a bra, saying it's underwear and necessary for modesty. They even prevent her from leaving the house if she doesn't wear one. The mom comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine. The daughter finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, given her small size. She lost her temper when her mom sent her a video about exercises to increase breast size, feeling her mom is disappointed in her body.\n\nSo, the core of the conflict is about personal autonomy versus parental expectations. The daughter believes her body and choices should be respected, while the parents see it as a matter of modesty and societal expectations. The parent's argument is based on tradition and possibly their own insecurities, while the daughter is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, in many places, wearing a bra is common for women, especially in certain settings. However, for someone with a very small chest size, it's not uncommon to choose not to wear one. The discomfort and practicality aspect is valid. The parents might be projecting their own standards onto the daughter, which the daughter resists.\n\nThe key points here are about the daughter's autonomy. At 17, she's a minor, but she's also an adolescent forming her own identity. The parents have a responsibility to guide, but there's a line between guidance and overstepping. The daughter's arguments about her body being her choice and the parent's comments being inappropriate suggest that the parents are imposing their views in a way that's causing emotional distress.\n\nThe daughter's outburst might have been harsh, but it came from a place of frustration. The parent's reaction\u2014crying\u2014shows the emotional tension, but it doesn't necessarily validate the parent's stance if their comments are based on unrealistic expectations. The daughter's stance is about self-acceptance and rejecting external pressures, which is a valid perspective, especially for someone with her body type.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to make decisions about her own body, given her physical characteristics and personal comfort. The parents' insistence might stem from their own insecurities or societal norms, but the daughter's choice is a personal one. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
