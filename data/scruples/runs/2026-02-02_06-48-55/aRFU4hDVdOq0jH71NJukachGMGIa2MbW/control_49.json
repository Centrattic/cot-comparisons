Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a 17-year-old girl who barely has an A-cup and doesn't wear a bra. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, especially her mom, who makes comments about being feminine and boys liking her. The daughter feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable for her body type and is upset that her mom is projecting her own insecurities. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, wearing a bra is considered standard for women, especially in public. But the author's situation is specific because she has a very small bust. For someone with minimal curves, a bra might not be necessary for support, which is one of the primary reasons for wearing them. Modesty could be another factor, but if she's not showing any, then it's more about what others might perceive. The layers she wears in winter probably cover her, so maybe the parents are more about the principle.\n\nThen there's the comfort aspect. Bras can be uncomfortable, and if she's choosing not to wear them for that reason, it's a personal choice. The parents' reactions seem extreme, especially not letting her leave the house. That's a bit of overstepping, maybe. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might also be pressuring her to conform to traditional gender roles, which isn't fair if the daughter doesn't identify with those roles.\n\nThe daughter's response, while harsh, comes from frustration. She mentions that her mom started crying, which indicates emotional distress on both sides. The daughter might feel that her mom is being unfair by making her wear a bra when it's not needed and by projecting her own insecurities. The key here is whether the parents have a legitimate concern or if it's their own issues.\n\nIn terms of body autonomy, the daughter is within her rights to decide what she wears on her own body. The parents' insistence could be seen as controlling. However, the daughter's age is a factor. At 17, she's a minor, so there's a balance between parental guidance and autonomy. But the issue is about clothing, which is part of personal choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the daughter isn't hurting anyone by not wearing a bra, especially given her body type. The parents' reactions seem to be based on their own expectations and perhaps insecurities. The daughter's choice is about comfort and self-acceptance. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
