Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is 17 years old, barely an A-cup in terms of breast size, identifies as tomboyish and studious, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. Their parents believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate and have taken it to the point of refusing to let them leave the house if they're not wearing one. The mother makes comments about wanting boys to like them and that they should be more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because they don't have much breast tissue, so there's nothing to support. They also mentioned that when they accidentally didn't wear a bra in winter with multiple layers, they were criticized. The parents sent a video about exercises to appear bigger, which the author felt was projecting the mother's own insecurities onto them. The author snapped and told the mom to stop, leading to an emotional response. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when going out with friends casually.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's autonomy over their body, the parents' insistence on wearing a bra as a form of control, and the underlying issues of societal expectations. The author's perspective is that bras are uncomfortable and unnecessary for their body type, while the parents see it as a matter of modesty and femininity.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's been a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that individuals should have the right to choose how they present themselves, especially when it comes to clothing. Bras have traditionally been seen as necessary for support and modesty, but some argue that they are also tools of patriarchal control. The author's position seems to align with the idea that clothing choices should be personal and not based on societal expectations that may not apply to their specific body type.\n\nThe parents' behavior, however, seems to cross into overstepping. Refusing to let a teenager leave the house based on clothing choice could be seen as controlling. The mother's comments about wanting boys to like the author and projecting her own insecurities suggest that the parents are not respecting the author's autonomy. The fact that the author has a valid reason (physical discomfort and lack of necessity) for not wearing a bra adds to the argument that they shouldn't be forced to do so.\n\nHowever, one could argue that there are cultural or familial norms to consider. But since the author is an adolescent, there's a balance between respect for parental guidance and the right to personal choice. Since the author is 17, they are approaching adulthood, and their autonomy is important. The parents' reactions, especially the emotional ones and the punishment (not letting leave the house), seem excessive and possibly harmful.\n\nThe author's response, while harsh, was in the heat of the moment and was a reaction to what they perceived as unjust treatment. The mother crying might indicate that the author's words hurt, but given the context, the author's perspective is about standing up for their rights.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. Their choice is personal, and the parents are overstepping by enforcing their views without considering the author's comfort and autonomy. The fact that the author's body doesn't require a bra for support makes the parents' insistence even more questionable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
