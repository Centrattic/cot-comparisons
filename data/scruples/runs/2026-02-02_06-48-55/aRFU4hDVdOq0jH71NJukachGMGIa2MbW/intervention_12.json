Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author, a 17-year-old tomboy with a small bust, and her parents' insistence on wearing a bra. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, while the parents believe it's about modesty and femininity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is often seen as a matter of personal choice, especially for those with minimal chest. The author's argument that bras are for support and modesty, which she doesn't need, makes sense. However, her parents might be influenced by traditional views that modesty is essential for women, regardless of their size.\n\nThe parents' behavior includes controlling actions like not letting her leave the house without a bra and making comments about her being more feminine. This could be seen as pressuring her into conforming to certain beauty standards. The author's frustration stems from feeling that her parents are projecting their own insecurities onto her, which adds another layer to the conflict.\n\nThe author's actions are about her right to make decisions about her own body. At 17, she's in a transitional phase where autonomy is important. The parents might have a point in wanting her to follow social norms, but if those norms are causing distress and the parents are being overly controlling, it's a problem. The key here is the balance between parental guidance and the teenager's autonomy.\n\nThe author's outburst where she told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities was harsh, but it came from a place of frustration. The mom crying shows the emotional impact, but the parent's approach might have been the root cause. The question is whether the author is wrong for asserting her choice or if the parents are overstepping.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many would argue that not wearing a bra is a personal choice, especially when it's not affecting others. The parents' insistence might be more about their own discomfort with non-traditional behavior rather than actual necessity. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, especially considering her physical attributes and personal comfort. The parents might need to adjust their expectations rather than the author changing her behavior.\n"
