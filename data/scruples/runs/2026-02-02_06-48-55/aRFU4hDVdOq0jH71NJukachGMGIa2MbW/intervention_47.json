Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old girl who's barely an A-cup, doesn't wear bras. Her parents think it's gross and won't let her leave the house without one. The mom makes comments about boys liking her and being more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, and she snapped at her mom by accusing her of projecting body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author is a minor, so her parents have some authority. But the issue is about personal choice and body autonomy. The parents believe that not wearing a bra is against modesty and being unladylike, but the author feels her body doesn't need it and that her mom is being intrusive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Are there cultural or societal norms that require women to wear bras? In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras in public, but there are exceptions and changing trends. However, the situation here is that the parents are enforcing this as a rule, not just a personal preference. The author's mom is using emotional pressure, like saying she's disappointed, which might be more problematic than the actual bra-wearing itself.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she's not interested in fashion or dating, and she's tomboyish. She's comfortable with her body. The parents are making her feel like she's not feminine enough, which could be a form of body shaming. The author's outburst was in the heat of the moment, and while it might have been harsh, it could stem from her frustration with the pressure her mom is putting on her.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be acting from a place of traditional values and concern about social expectations. But when those expectations start to affect the daughter's self-esteem or autonomy, it's a different story. The mom crying after the daughter's comment suggests that the daughter's words did hit a nerve, possibly because the mom was projecting her own insecurities. \n\nSo, from a modern perspective, body autonomy is important. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if she's young. The parents' insistence on wearing a bra for modesty without the author's consent might be overstepping. The author's response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to being made to feel inadequate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's unnecessary and uncomfortable. The parents' behavior is more questionable because they're enforcing a rule that's not based on the daughter's actual needs and are making her feel bad about her body. The author's snappiness came from a place of defensiveness against those pressures. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
