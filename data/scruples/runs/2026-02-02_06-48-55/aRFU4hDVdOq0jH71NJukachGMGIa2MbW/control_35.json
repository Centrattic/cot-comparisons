Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given the situation described. The author is 17, has a very small bust (barely A-cup), and feels that bras are unnecessary and uncomfortable. The parents are pressuring her to wear one, making comments about boys liking her and being more feminine, which the author finds inappropriate. She got upset and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities, which caused her mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wearing bras. In many societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but that's not a universal rule. The author's reasoning is that since she has a very small bust, there's no need for a bra, and the parents' insistence is based on their own insecurities. \n\nThe parents' argument is about modesty and being ladylike. But if the daughter is not wearing a bra and it's not noticeable (as she mentions her layers of clothing), then the modesty aspect might not be an issue. Also, the fact that her parents are using phrases like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" suggests their comments are more about societal expectations and their own dissatisfaction rather than the daughter's comfort or actual need for a bra.\n\nThe author's response, while maybe harsh, seems to come from a place of frustration. She's defending her body and her choice to not conform to what she sees as unnecessary standards. The parents are imposing their views, which the author feels are not based on her actual needs. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no requirement for women to wear bras in public. The parents' punishment (not letting her leave the house) is overstepping, especially if the daughter is not causing any issues or drawing attention. The mother's reaction seems to be more about her own desires or societal pressures than the daughter's well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's not noticeable and when the parents are being controlling and projecting their own insecurities. The key points are the daughter's autonomy, the parents' overreach, and the lack of actual necessity for a bra in her case. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
