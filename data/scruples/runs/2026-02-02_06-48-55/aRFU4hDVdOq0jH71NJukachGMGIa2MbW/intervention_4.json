Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is between the author and her parents. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents argue that bras are necessary as underwear and that not wearing them is inappropriate. They even prevent her from going out if she doesn't wear one. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is making her feel bad about her body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might believe that wearing a bra is part of modesty and hygiene, so not wearing one is \"gross.\" They might also want their daughter to be more feminine, hence the comments about boys liking her. However, the daughter has a valid point about her body size and comfort. Bras for a very small bust don't provide much support and can be uncomfortable. Also, societal expectations about what is appropriate can vary. In some contexts, not wearing a bra might be more accepted, especially if the person is not wearing tight clothing.\n\nThe key here is the conflict over autonomy. The daughter is an adult in some countries, but at 17, she might still be under her parents' authority. However, the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) over a personal choice that affects the daughter's comfort. The daughter's argument is about bodily autonomy and not wanting to conform to her mother's expectations. The mother's comments about the daughter being like a boy and needing to be more feminine touch on societal pressures and possible body image issues on the mother's part.\n\nLegally, the parents might have some authority, but ethically, it's about the daughter's right to make choices about her own body. The daughter's response, while harsh, might stem from frustration. She's standing up for herself, which is a positive trait, but the way she expressed it could have been more constructive. However, the mother's approach of using emotional manipulation and punishment might be more at fault here.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her autonomy and is within her rights to feel that her body is her own. The parents are imposing their views on her body, which is problematic. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
