Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (mosquito-bite-sized), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, saying it's gross not to and making comments about being more feminine. The mom even sent a video about exercises to make her look bigger, which the author resents. The author stood up for herself, got into an argument, and now is questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's stance is about personal choice and comfort. Since she has a very small chest, she doesn't see the need for a bra for support or modesty. She also feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her. On the other hand, the parents are enforcing what they see as appropriate behavior for a daughter, emphasizing modesty and femininity. They might believe that wearing a bra is a standard social expectation regardless of breast size.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The author's choice to not wear a bra is her personal decision, especially if it's causing her discomfort. However, societal norms often dictate that women should wear bras in certain contexts, even for small chests. But the parents' approach, particularly the mother's, seems overbearing. They are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) and making hurtful comments about her body and gender identity. The author's response was emotional, but it's understandable given the pressure she's under.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author is asserting her right to make decisions about her body, which is a valid point. The parents, while trying to enforce their standards, are not respecting her autonomy and are making her feel bad about her natural body. The mother's comment about projecting her insecurities adds another layer\u2014she might be dealing with her own issues, which is unfair to the daughter.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The conflict here is more about the parents' control and the societal pressure they're trying to impose. The author's stance is about personal comfort and self-acceptance, which should be respected. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
