Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small bust, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are upset and make her wear a bra, with the mother making comments about femininity and boys liking her. The author lost her temper and told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's body type is a key factor here. She's an A-cup at most, so maybe a bra isn't necessary for support. The parents might be enforcing societal norms or their own expectations, but is that reasonable? The author's discomfort is valid. Bras can be uncomfortable, especially if they don't provide necessary support. \n\nThe parents are using emotional manipulation by not letting her leave the house without a bra. That seems controlling. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being feminine might be trying to push the daughter into a certain gender role, which could be problematic. The author's response, while harsh, might stem from feeling pressured. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's making a personal choice about her body. Since she's a minor, parents do have some authority, but there's a line between guidance and control. The mother's approach seems more about her own expectations rather than the daughter's well-being. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially if it's not necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might believe they're teaching modesty or preparing her for societal expectations. However, the daughter's autonomy is important. Since she's a teenager, she's developing her identity. The mother's comments about body image and projecting her insecurities are harmful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her comfort and autonomy, which is valid. The parents are overstepping by making a big deal about something that's not necessary for her body type. The answer should be B.\n"
