Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, describes herself as plain-looking and tomboyish, with a very small bust (A-cup). Her parents insist she wear a bra, considering it underwear and necessary for modesty. They even prevent her from leaving the house without one, and the mother makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially given her size, and feels that her mother is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many Western cultures, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but there's also a growing movement towards body positivity and the idea that women should have the choice to wear what they're comfortable with. The author's perspective is that since she has a very small bust, bras are unnecessary for her, which makes sense physically. Comfort is a big factor here\u2014wearing a bra when it's uncomfortable without a good reason might be reasonable to avoid.\n\nThe parents' stance is that not wearing a bra is \"gross\" and \"unladylike,\" which could reflect traditional or conservative views on modesty. However, the author's refusal to wear a bra isn't about rebellion for the sake of it but rather about her own comfort and self-acceptance. The mother's comments about wanting her daughter to be more feminine and for boys to like her might be contributing to the conflict, suggesting possible unrealistic expectations or pressure on the daughter to conform to certain beauty standards.\n\nLegally and ethically, a 17-year-old is a minor, so her parents have some authority over her appearance until she turns 18. However, the question is whether the parents are in the right to enforce wearing a bra in this context. The daughter's argument is that the requirement is unnecessary and based on the mother's insecurities rather than her own needs or societal norms. The author is asserting her autonomy, which is a valid point, especially as she's approaching adulthood.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, comfort, and the parents' role in enforcing certain standards. While parents have a role in guiding their children, they also need to respect their child's autonomy and individuality, especially as they grow older. The mother's reaction seems to stem from her own dissatisfaction with the daughter not meeting her expectations, which could be a form of projection. The daughter's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to what she perceives as unfair pressure.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, there's a shift towards valuing personal choice and body positivity. Many people would argue that the daughter is within her rights to choose not to wear a bra if it's comfortable and appropriate. The parents' insistence could be seen as outdated or not considering the daughter's personal preferences and physical needs.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of modesty and cultural expectations. If the daughter is in a society where not wearing a bra in public is considered inappropriate, there might be some validity to the parents' concerns. But given her small size and the fact that she's wearing multiple layers, the practicality of the parents' worries might be questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision not to wear a bra is a personal choice based on her comfort and self-acceptance. The parents' enforcement of this rule seems more about their own insecurities and traditional views rather than the daughter's well-being. The daughter's anger stems from feeling pressured to conform to expectations that don't align with her identity. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
