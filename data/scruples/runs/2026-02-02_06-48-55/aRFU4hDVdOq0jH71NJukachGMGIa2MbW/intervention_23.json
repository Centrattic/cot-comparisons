Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size, and she finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, think it's important for her to wear one for modesty and femininity reasons. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the pressure is unwarranted given her small size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't causing harm to others; she's making a personal choice about her own body. Her parents are enforcing their views, which might be rooted in cultural or personal beliefs about modesty and femininity. However, the author is asserting her autonomy over her body, which is a valid stance. The key here is whether the author has a right to make this choice and if the parents overstepped by not allowing her to leave without a bra and making derogatory comments.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, individuals do have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The parents might be trying to instill certain societal norms, but if those norms are causing distress and the child is of an age where she can make informed decisions, the parents' approach could be problematic. The author's discomfort and the parents' insistence might be a clash between autonomy and parental control.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she's not interested in fashion or dating and is tomboyish. Her parents' comments like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" might be pressuring her to conform to traditional feminine ideals, which could be seen as invalidating her identity. The author's argument that she's as good as a boy in terms of not needing a bra is a point about how societal expectations don't apply equally to everyone, especially those who don't fit the typical feminine stereotypes.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we go purely by societal norms, some might argue that not wearing a bra is inappropriate in public. However, given her physical characteristics and the lack of visibility or support needed, it's a personal choice. The key issue here is parental overreach. The parents are enforcing their views in a way that's controlling and possibly harmful, while the author is defending her right to be comfortable and authentic.\n\nIn many cases, decisions about clothing, especially regarding one's own body, are considered personal. Unless there's a specific societal rule or law being broken, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents' behavior seems more about their own expectations and dissatisfaction rather than the author's actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
