Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves a 17-year-old with a very small chest size who finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without it. The mother makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and appeals to boys liking her. The daughter lashes out, feeling her mom is projecting insecurities, and the mother cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter's physical situation: she's barely an A-cup, so a bra might not serve the purpose of support. If there's nothing to support, the argument for wearing a bra for support is weak. Also, the daughter's autonomy is a factor. She's an adolescent, so there's a balance between parental authority and her right to make her own choices, especially regarding her body. The mother's actions\u2014refusing to let her leave the house and making derogatory comments\u2014seem over the top. The daughter's response, while heated, was in reaction to what she perceives as invalid pressure and judgment. \n\nFrom a societal standpoint, there's been more acceptance in recent years of personal choice regarding clothing, especially when it comes to comfort and body autonomy. The mother's insistence might be rooted in traditional gender norms, but the daughter is pushing back against those norms. The mother's comment about boys liking her implies that the daughter's worth is tied to her appearance, which is a problematic view. \n\nThe daughter's statement about her mom being disappointed in her body type suggests that the mother has her own insecurities, which the daughter is resisting. The daughter's right to feel comfortable in her own skin without societal or parental pressure is important here. Also, the mother's punishment of not letting her leave the house is a form of control that might be crossing a line. \n\nLegally, parents have some authority over their minor children, but when it comes to personal choices, especially non-harmful ones like clothing, that authority isn't absolute. The daughter's choice not to wear a bra doesn't harm others, so the mother's reaction seems excessive. The daughter's outburst, while perhaps harsh, was in self-defense against what she sees as invalid criticism. \n\nSo putting it all together: the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. The mother's actions are more problematic because they involve control and invalidating the daughter's comfort and autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
