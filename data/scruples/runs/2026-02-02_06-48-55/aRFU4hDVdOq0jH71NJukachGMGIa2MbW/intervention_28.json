Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old girl with a very small bust size. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially since there's not much to support. Her parents, particularly her mom, are pushing her to wear a bra, saying it's about modesty and femininity. The mom even comments things like \"don't you want boys to like you?\" which the author finds inappropriate. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her, and she's standing her ground by refusing to wear a bra.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms here. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is often seen as a standard part of dressing modestly, especially in public. But the author's case is complicated because her body doesn't require one for support. The mom's insistence might stem from traditional views on femininity, which the author rejects because she's tomboyish and not interested in those ideals.\n\nThe key points here are bodily autonomy and the right to make personal choices about one's own body. The author argues that it's her decision, while the parents believe they have authority over her choices. The mom's behavior, especially the punishment (not letting her leave the house) and the emotional comments, might be overstepping. The author's response\u2014losing her temper and calling her mom out for projecting insecurities\u2014shows tension and possible emotional harm from the mom's side.\n\nI should also consider the health aspect. Bras are primarily for support and comfort, but if they're causing discomfort and aren't necessary due to small size, then not wearing them isn't harmful. The mom's focus on appearance and societal expectations might be more about her own standards than the daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong if she's making a choice based on her comfort and the lack of necessity. The parents, however, might be enforcing outdated or unrealistic standards. The mom's behavior, including emotional manipulation and punishment, is questionable. The author standing up for herself, despite the conflict, seems justified in this context.\n"
