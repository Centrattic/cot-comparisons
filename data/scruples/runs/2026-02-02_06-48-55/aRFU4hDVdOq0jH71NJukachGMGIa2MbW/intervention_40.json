Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents, especially the mother, being very strict about it and making comments about the author's body and femininity. The author is 17, describes herself as plain-looking and tomboyish, with a very small bust. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, given her size. The parents, on the other hand, believe it's a form of underwear and that not wearing one is gross. They also make comments about wanting her to be more feminine and appeal to boys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around wearing bras. In many societies, bras are considered standard undergarments for women, even for small busts, because they're part of the expected modesty. However, the author is very small, an A-cup, which means the necessity for support might be minimal. There's also the aspect of personal choice and body autonomy. The author is asserting her right to decide how she feels about her body, which is a valid point.\n\nThe parents' perspective is rooted in their beliefs about modesty and femininity. They might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto their daughter. The mother's comments about boys liking her and the author being more feminine could be signs of the mother's own insecurities or societal pressures. The author feels that her mother is disappointed in her for not fitting traditional feminine norms. The conflict here is between the parental expectations and the daughter's personal autonomy.\n\nThe author's outburst was in response to her mother sending a video about exercises to increase breast size, which she didn't ask for. Her reaction, while harsh, might be a result of built-up frustration. She's defending her body and her choice not to conform to her mother's standards. However, the mother's emotional reaction (crying) indicates the depth of the hurt caused by the daughter's words.\n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra, so the author isn't breaking any rules. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents are trying to enforce their values, but the daughter is asserting her autonomy. The key issue is whether the parents are overstepping by enforcing their views and using punishment (not letting her leave the house) to control her choices. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is a minor, so her parents have some authority in raising her, but they also need to respect her autonomy and individuality. The mother's comments about the daughter's body and femininity could be harmful, promoting body image issues that the author is trying to resist. The author's argument that she's small and the bra is unnecessary is reasonable. The discomfort and bulkiness she mentions are real issues for some people.\n\nThe mother's disappointment might stem from her own expectations, but it's not fair to project that onto her daughter. The author's stance on body autonomy is valid. However, the way she expressed her frustration (calling her mother out in a harsh way) was inconsiderate, even if the mother was wrong. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, but her reaction could have been handled better.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given her physical situation and the parents' overreach. The parents are enforcing their views in a way that's controlling and possibly harmful. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
