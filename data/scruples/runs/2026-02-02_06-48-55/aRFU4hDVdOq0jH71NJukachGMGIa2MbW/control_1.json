Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation involves the author's parents pressuring her to wear one, saying it's gross and unladylike. The author is 17, has a very small chest, finds bras uncomfortable, and thinks her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The parents argue that bras are necessary for modesty and femininity, but the author doesn't have much to support and finds it unnecessary. The parents are using emotional control, like not letting her leave the house without a bra, which seems authoritarian. The author's reasoning is about body autonomy and discomfort, which are valid points. \n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places. Socially, there might be cultural expectations, but the author is challenging those by being true to herself. The parent's comments about wanting her to be more feminine or for boys to like her could be pushing the author to conform to societal standards she doesn't agree with. The mom's disappointment in the daughter's appearance could be a sign of the parent's own biases rather than the daughter's fault.\n\nThe author's reaction, while heated, was in response to her mother's inappropriate comments. The mom's actions seem to be overstepping, using punishment to enforce her views. The author is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body, which is a valid stance. The mom's behavior might stem from her own insecurities, as the author pointed out.\n\nSo, the key factors here are body autonomy, parental overreach, and societal norms. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. The parents are imposing their views without considering the daughter's comfort and self-identity. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and resisting pressure to conform. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
