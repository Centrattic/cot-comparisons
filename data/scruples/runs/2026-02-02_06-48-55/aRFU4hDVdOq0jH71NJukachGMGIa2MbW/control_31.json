Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given her situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a barely A-cup, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear one, citing modesty and being feminine. The mom compares her to a boy and comments on wanting boys to like her. The author feels her mom is projecting her own issues onto her.\n\nSo, the main points are personal comfort and autonomy versus parental expectations. The author isn't causing harm to others by not wearing a bra; she's choosing what she's comfortable with. The parents are enforcing a norm that the author doesn't agree with, and the mom's comments seem to be based on societal standards rather than the author's needs.\n\nConsidering body autonomy and the fact that the author isn't hurting anyone, it's about her right to make decisions about her own body. The parents might believe in certain social norms, but the author has the right to her own preferences. The mom's reaction seems more about her own insecurities and societal expectations rather than the author's actual well-being.\n\nThe author's outburst was in the heat of the moment, and while it's understandable she was upset, it's not the core of whether she's in the wrong. The key issue is her choice not to wear a bra. Since there's no harm involved and it's about personal comfort, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
