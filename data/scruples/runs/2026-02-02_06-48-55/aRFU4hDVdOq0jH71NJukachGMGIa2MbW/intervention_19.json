Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra based on the given situation. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are upset, saying it's \"gross\" and \"unladylike,\" and they don't let her leave the house without one. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the mom's comments about wanting her to be more feminine or popular are inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a minor, so parental authority might be relevant. However, the parents are enforcing a rule that the daughter feels is unnecessary and possibly harmful to her self-esteem. The mom is using emotional pressure, like implying the daughter should be more feminine to attract boys, which could be problematic. The daughter is standing up for her body autonomy, which is a valid point. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe they think the daughter is being disrespectful, or that parents have the right to set certain standards. But I need to evaluate both sides. The parents might believe they're teaching modesty or grooming her for societal expectations. However, the daughter's comfort and autonomy are also important, especially if the physical discomfort is real. Plus, the mom's comments about her being \"unladylike\" and the daughter's mosquito-bite-titted comment could be seen as body-shaming. \n\nThe daughter's outburst was about her mom projecting insecurities, which might be true or not, but in the heat of the moment, it's a common reaction. The key points are the parents' enforcement of a rule that's unnecessary for the daughter's body type and their emotional manipulation. Is there a right or wrong here? It's a clash between parental authority and a teenager's autonomy. The daughter is in a position where she's trying to assert her identity, which is normal. If the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) for a non-harmful action, that's possibly overstepping. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reasoning is logical: if she's not wearing a bra, and it's not noticeable, then the rule is unnecessary. The parents might not realize that their pressure is causing emotional distress. In terms of societal norms, in many places, not wearing a bra is a personal choice, even for women with small chests. However, there's a cultural aspect where some families enforce such norms strictly. \n\nSo, considering all this, the daughter is not in the wrong for choosing to not wear a bra if it's comfortable for her and not causing actual harm. The parents' actions might be more in the wrong for enforcing a rule that's unnecessary and causing emotional distress. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
