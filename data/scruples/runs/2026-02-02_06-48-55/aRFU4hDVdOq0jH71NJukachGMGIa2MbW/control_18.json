Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 17-year-old girl with a very small chest size (barely A-cup). She identifies as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating. She doesn't find bras necessary because she's not getting much support from them and finds them uncomfortable. Her parents argue that bras are underwear, so not wearing one is gross. They pressure her to wear one for modesty and femininity reasons. There's some conflict here, especially when the mother sends her a video about exercises to make her look bigger, which the author found as projecting insecurities onto her.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, comfort, and societal expectations. The author is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body. She's not causing harm to others, just choosing not to wear a bra when it's uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. The parents are enforcing their views, possibly rooted in traditional gender norms, but the daughter is resisting that pressure.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for comfort and support, but there's a growing movement towards body positivity and personal choice. Since the author's body doesn't require a bra for support, forcing her to wear one could be seen as unnecessary. Also, the mother's comments about wanting her to be more feminine and get boys to like her might be contributing to body image issues the author is trying to stand up against.\n\nThe author is standing up for her self-image, which is important, especially during adolescence. The conflict arises from parental control versus personal autonomy. Since the author isn't going against any laws or widely accepted social norms that would justify punishment, her choice is more about personal comfort and self-acceptance. \n\nHowever, there's a line between personal choice and respecting parental concerns. But in this case, the parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) over a personal choice, which might be overstepping. The author's response, while heated, seems to be a defense of her autonomy, which is reasonable given the context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra. Her reasoning is based on personal comfort and rejecting societal pressures to conform to certain beauty standards. The parents' insistence might stem from their own biases, and the author is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body.\n"
