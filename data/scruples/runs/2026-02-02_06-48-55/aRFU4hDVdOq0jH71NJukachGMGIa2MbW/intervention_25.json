Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size, around an A-cup, and identifies as tomboyish. Her parents insist she wears a bra, considering it necessary for modesty and femininity, and they use that as a reason to control her leaving the house. The author finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially since she doesn't have much to support, and she's frustrated that her mother projects her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents' argument is rooted in societal norms and expectations about modesty and femininity. They might believe that wearing a bra is a standard part of being a girl, and they're trying to prepare her for social expectations. However, the author's perspective is about personal autonomy and comfort. She feels that her body doesn't require a bra, and she's not interested in conforming to traditional gender roles. \n\nThe author mentions that her mother's comments are inappropriate and that she's being punished (not allowed to leave the house) for not wearing a bra. That raises questions about parental control and the right to make personal decisions about one's body. The author's stance is that her mother is imposing her own standards and body image issues onto her, which the author is resisting. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places, so from a legal standpoint, she isn't in the wrong. Socially, it's a bit more complex. In many cultures, there are expectations about clothing, but these can vary. The key issue here is the parent's attempt to enforce these norms through punishment, which could be seen as overstepping. The author is asserting her autonomy, which is a valid aspect of personal rights. \n\nHowever, the author did lose her temper and made a hurtful comment about her mother's insecurities. That part of the situation is problematic because it's disrespectful and could have been handled more calmly. But the core issue of not wearing a bra is about personal choice and comfort. \n\nThe parents' behavior might be influenced by their own expectations and societal pressures, but that doesn't justify controlling their daughter's decisions, especially regarding her own body. The author's right to choose how she dresses, particularly when it's comfortable and appropriate for her body type, is a significant factor here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's outburst was inappropriate, the main issue of not wearing a bra isn't something she's in the wrong for. The parents are enforcing norms that may not be relevant to the author's individual needs and body. The key is the balance between respecting parental guidance and individual autonomy. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
