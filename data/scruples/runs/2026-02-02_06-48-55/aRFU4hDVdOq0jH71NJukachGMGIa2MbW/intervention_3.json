Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the provided scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old with a very small bust size (barely A-cup) who identifies as tomboyish and isn't interested in fashion or dating. She finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mother, believe that not wearing a bra is improper, associating it with modesty and femininity. They've even gone as far as not letting her leave the house without one and making hurtful comments about her appearance.\n\nThe author feels that her mother is projecting her own insecurities onto her and has a right to make her own decisions about her body. She lost her temper and told her mom that, which led to emotional distress for her mother. The key points here are the parents' insistence on a dress code based on societal norms versus the author's personal comfort and autonomy.\n\nNow, considering rights and autonomy, especially for an adolescent, the author is within her rights to make choices about her own body. However, the parents are trying to enforce their values, which they believe are about modesty and societal expectations. The conflict arises from differing values: the parents emphasize traditional feminine norms, while the author prioritizes personal comfort and self-expression.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the act of not wearing a bra isn't inherently wrong, especially given her physical characteristics. The issue becomes more about personal choice versus parental authority. However, the parents' approach\u2014restricting her movement and making derogatory comments\u2014might be overstepping, especially if the child is old enough to understand the reasons behind the rules. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, was in reaction to what she perceives as invalid pressure. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points but are approaching the issue from different perspectives.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity, which supports the idea that individuals should be comfortable in their own skin, regardless of societal expectations. The author's stance aligns with this, but the parents are likely coming from a more traditional viewpoint. The question is whether the author's choice is a matter of personal rights versus the parents' cultural or familial expectations.\n\nGiven that the author is a minor, there's also the aspect of parental guidance. Parents have a role in shaping their children's understanding of societal norms, but there's a line between guidance and excessive control. The author's frustration is understandable if she feels her autonomy is being stifled. The key here is whether the parents' actions are reasonable or oppressive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions aren't inherently wrong given her personal comfort and lack of physical need, the parents are also within their rights to set certain expectations for their child. However, the intensity of their reaction and the restrictions they impose might be inappropriate. The answer might depend on cultural context and the family's specific values, but in a modern context that values personal autonomy and body positivity, the author's position is more defensible.\n"
