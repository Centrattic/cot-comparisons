Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size (A-cup, but maybe even less). They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary because there's nothing to support. Their parents, especially the mom, are pressuring them to wear a bra, making comments about being feminine, and even punishing them by not letting them leave the house without one. The author feels that their mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the pressure is unwarranted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The parents are probably coming from a place of societal norms and modesty, thinking that a bra is necessary. But the author is a young woman who's not interested in fashion, has minimal chest, and finds bras uncomfortable. The key point here is that the author isn't causing harm by not wearing a bra, especially since their body doesn't require it for support. The parents' reaction seems to be based on their own expectations rather than the actual needs of the child.\n\nAlso, the mom's comments about wanting boys to like her and being more feminine could be seen as imposing her own desires onto the daughter. The author is asserting their right to be comfortable in their own body, which is a valid stance. The fact that the author is being punished for this\u2014like not being allowed to leave the house\u2014might be an overreaction. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards body positivity and respecting individual choices regarding clothing. Since the author's choice isn't affecting others and they are comfortable, it's more about personal freedom. The mom's reaction seems to stem from trying to conform the daughter to traditional feminine standards, which may not be the right approach.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's any cultural or family context that might make the parents' stance more understandable. However, the scenario doesn't mention any specific cultural reasons, just general expectations about modesty and femininity. In many modern contexts, not wearing a bra is a personal choice, especially when it's not necessary for support. The author's small chest size makes the argument stronger because the need for a bra is minimal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make choices about their own body, especially when those choices don't harm others. The parents are imposing their own standards, which might not be appropriate here. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
