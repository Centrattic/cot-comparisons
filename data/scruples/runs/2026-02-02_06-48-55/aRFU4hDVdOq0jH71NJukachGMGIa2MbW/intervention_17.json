Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), identifies as tomboyish, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. She doesn't wear a bra because she finds it uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, insist she wears one, calling it a form of underwear and being upset when she doesn't. The mom makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine and likes boys, which the author finds inappropriate. The author got angry, said her mom was projecting insecurities, and the mom cried. The author now wonders if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents' perspective is that a bra is underwear necessary for modesty and as part of being a lady. But the author has no need for support, given her small size, and finds bras uncomfortable. She doesn't see the point. The conflict is between parental expectations and the daughter's comfort and personal choice.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, in many cultures, wearing a bra is expected for women, but there's a growing movement arguing that it's a personal choice and not necessary for everyone. The author's parents are enforcing their views, which the daughter feels is projecting their own insecurities onto her. The daughter's argument is that she's comfortable in her body and that her parents are overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, body image, and parental authority. The daughter is at an age where she's forming her own identity, and her parents are trying to enforce their standards. The author's actions are about her own comfort and self-expression. The parents, on the other hand, might be trying to prepare her for societal expectations.\n\nBut the author is also 17, so her autonomy is a factor. Should she have the right to decide what she wears, especially when it's not affecting others? The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially given the daughter's small size. The argument about support and modesty might not apply here since there's nothing to support. The mom's comments about wanting boys to like her might be problematic, implying that the daughter's worth is tied to her appearance or attractiveness, which is a common criticism of such parental pressures.\n\nThe daughter's response, while heated, was in reaction to what she perceives as unfair treatment. She's standing up for her body and her choices, which is a positive aspect of self-advocacy. However, the way she expressed it might have been hurtful, especially causing her mom to cry. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice based on her comfort and body type. The parents' insistence on wearing a bra doesn't align with her needs and may reflect their own insecurities or traditional views rather than practicality. The daughter's right to autonomy in such a personal matter is important, especially when the issue is as trivial as bra size and comfort. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
