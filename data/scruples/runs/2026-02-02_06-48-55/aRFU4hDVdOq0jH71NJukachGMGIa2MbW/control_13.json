Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra as described in the situation. Let me start by breaking down the details. The author is 17 years old, with a barely A-cup, identifies as tomboyish, and isn't interested in fashion or dating. Their parents believe bras are necessary underwear and get upset when she doesn't wear one. The mother comments on wanting her to be more feminine and seems disappointed, leading to a conflict where the author lashes out.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy versus parental expectations. The author feels that not wearing a bra is comfortable and appropriate for her body type, while the parents see it as a matter of modesty and femininity. The author argues that her small chest doesn't require support, so a bra is unnecessary. She also feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities onto her daughter. The parents are enforcing a rule that the author finds illogical and uncomfortable.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around undergarments. In many societies, wearing a bra is considered standard, especially in public. However, there's a growing movement advocating for body positivity and personal choice regarding clothing. The author's parents might be coming from a place of traditional expectations, whereas the author is asserting her right to choose what's comfortable for her body.\n\nAnother angle is parental authority versus a teenager's independence. At 17, the author is approaching adulthood and may feel entitled to make her own decisions, especially regarding personal attire. However, parents often have the authority to set household rules until the child is independent. The conflict here is about the parents using punishment (not letting her leave the house) for a choice that the author sees as a personal preference.\n\nThe author's comment about her mother being disappointed in her for not being \"popular\" or \"gorgeous\" adds another layer. It suggests that the mother's expectations may be influenced by her own desires rather than the daughter's well-being. The author's frustration leading to an outburst is understandable, especially if she feels her mother is being unfair.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is wrong, it's important to note that there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, the author isn't violating any laws or societal norms that would universally deem her wrong. Her choice is about personal comfort and rejecting societal pressures about femininity. The parents' reaction might be based on their own values, but enforcing those without considering the daughter's perspective could be seen as overstepping.\n\nI should also consider the health aspect. The author mentions discomfort with bras, which is a valid concern. If a bra isn't necessary for support, then the discomfort is a legitimate issue. However, some might argue that even a small amount of coverage is about modesty, but again, that's subjective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, especially given her small chest size and personal comfort. The real issue lies in the parents' insistence on enforcing a rule that doesn't align with the daughter's needs and body type. The author's response, while heated, was a reaction to what she perceives as unfair treatment and projection from her mother. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
