Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are upset about it, saying it's unladylike and that she should wear one. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many societies, wearing a bra is seen as standard for modesty, especially in public. However, the author's body type is a key factor here. If she's a very small chest, the necessity for support might be minimal. The discomfort aspect is also valid; if bras are causing her physical discomfort without providing actual benefit, that's a point in her favor.\n\nThen there's the aspect of parental authority versus personal autonomy. The parents are enforcing their views, which might be based on their cultural or personal beliefs. However, the daughter is an adolescent, developing her own identity. The argument here is about whether the parents have the right to enforce such a personal choice.\n\nThe mother's comments about wanting her daughter to be more feminine or liked by boys could be seen as pressuring the daughter to conform to traditional gender roles, which the daughter is rejecting. The daughter's outburst suggests she feels misunderstood and that her mom is projecting her own desires onto her. The mom's reaction (crying) indicates emotional distress, but the daughter's frustration might be justified if she's being forced into something she doesn't want.\n\nLegally, in many places, personal dress is a matter of individual choice. However, parents do have some authority over their children's appearances until they're adults. But when it comes to something as personal as undergarments, especially when it's causing conflict and not affecting others, the line between reasonable concern and overstepping might be thin.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that no one else cares about her not wearing a bra, except her mom. This implies that the issue isn't about public decency but rather the mother's personal views. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and not conforming to societal expectations. \n\nConsidering all these points, the core issue is about respecting personal choice versus parental expectations. Since the author is not causing harm to others and her choice is based on her own comfort and body acceptance, it's possible she's not in the wrong. On the other hand, the parents might feel they're instilling values of modesty and appropriateness. However, forcing a child into uncomfortable clothing without valid health or safety reasons could be seen as overbearing.\n\nI need to balance cultural norms with individual rights. In this case, the daughter's right to her own comfort and identity versus the mother's traditional views. Given that the daughter is 17, she's approaching adulthood and may need to assert her autonomy. The mother's behavior seems to stem from personal insecurities and societal pressures, which doesn't make her right. The author's actions are a form of self-expression and self-acceptance, which are positive traits.\n"
