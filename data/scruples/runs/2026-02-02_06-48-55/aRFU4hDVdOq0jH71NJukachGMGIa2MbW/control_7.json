Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup or even smaller and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents, especially her mom, are upset about this, saying it's gross and unladylike, and they won't let her leave the house without one. The author is defensive, feeling like her mom has body image issues and is projecting them onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms. In many places, it's common to wear a bra as part of dressing modestly, especially when going out in public. But the author is saying that she physically doesn't have anything to support, so the necessity for a bra is questionable. Since she's a minor, her parents have the authority to set some rules, but there's a line when it comes to respecting her body autonomy.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is that bras are underwear and thus necessary for modesty. But if the author's body doesn't require a bra for support or coverage, then maybe the parents are overstepping. The author does have the right to make personal decisions about her body, especially if there's no health or safety issue involved. The parent's comments about boys liking her or being more feminine seem to push traditional gender expectations, which the author resists. That could be part of the conflict here.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's physical need for a bra (which she says is minimal), 2) the parents' control over her decisions, 3) the emotional pressure and punishment (not letting her leave), and 4) the author's right to self-expression and body autonomy.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, as a teenager, she's supposed to develop her identity. If the parents are forcing her to conform to their standards without considering her comfort or autonomy, that's problematic. However, since she's a minor, parents do have some say in their child's upbringing, but it shouldn't be authoritarian or harmful.\n\nThe author's outburst where she told her mom to stop projecting her insecurities is intense, but it's in response to what she perceives as unfair treatment. The mom's reaction of crying shows how sensitive the issue is, but it also highlights the lack of mutual understanding.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if she's not causing harm to herself or others and is making a personal choice about her body, then she's not in the wrong. The parents, on the other hand, might be imposing their views without considering her individuality. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
