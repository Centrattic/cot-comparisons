Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras unnecessary and uncomfortable. Her parents enforce wearing a bra, arguing it's about modesty and femininity, and they even prevent her from leaving the house if she doesn't. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities onto her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might believe that wearing a bra is a standard of modesty and appropriate dressing, especially for a teenage girl. Their concern could stem from societal norms they were raised with. However, the daughter's physical reality\u2014being a mosquito-bite flat A-cup\u2014makes a bra largely unnecessary for support. The discomfort and lack of necessity are valid points here.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal autonomy. At 17, the daughter is developing her own identity. The parents are imposing their views about femininity and dress, which might be seen as controlling. The daughter's response, while heated, seems to be about self-acceptance and rejecting unrealistic expectations. The mother's reaction, including comments about boys and femininity, could be pushing the daughter to conform to standards that don't align with her self-image.\n\nThe key here is whether the daughter's choice infringes on others' rights or violates a reasonable societal norm. Since the daughter is in a small chest size, not wearing a bra under regular clothing isn't likely to be noticeable, so the modesty argument is weak. The parents' enforcement through punishment (not letting her leave) seems extreme. The daughter's stance is about bodily autonomy and rejecting her mother's projected insecurities.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, not wearing a bra might be more controversial, but in others, it's more accepted, especially for small chests. The daughter's tomboyish nature and lack of interest in fashion suggest that this is a personal choice rooted in comfort and self-identity, not rebellion for the sake of it.\n\nThe mother's emotional reaction and the daughter's response indicate a deeper conflict. The daughter's comment about her mom projecting insecurities is a strong point, suggesting the mother's actions aren't just about modesty but about personal dissatisfaction. The daughter's outburst, while harsh, was in a heated moment and points to the stress of being forced to conform.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a significant factor. The daughter's right to make decisions about her own body should be respected, especially when the choice doesn't harm anyone else. The parents' insistence might be overstepping, particularly if they're using punishment to enforce their views without considering the daughter's physical comfort and personal beliefs.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. Her choice is about personal comfort and identity, and the parents' insistence is more about their own expectations and societal norms. The daughter's response, while emotional, is a reaction to being forced to conform to standards that don't fit her reality. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
