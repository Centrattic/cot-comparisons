Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, has a very small chest (barely A-cup), and identifies as tomboyish with no interest in fashion or dating. They find bras uncomfortable and unnecessary since they don't have much to support. The parents are pushing for them to wear a bra, citing modesty and societal expectations, even going so far as not letting them leave the house without one. The mom is making comments about wanting boys to like the daughter, which the daughter finds inappropriate. The daughter snapped at the mom, leading to the mom crying, and now the daughter is questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's perspective: she's a minor, and her parents are enforcing a rule that she finds uncomfortable and unnecessary. The daughter is asserting her autonomy over her own body. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) to enforce their views. The daughter's argument is that since she has a very small chest, bras aren't needed for support or modesty. Additionally, the mom's comments about the daughter's body image and projecting her own insecurities are problematic. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the daughter might have the right to make decisions about her own body, even if she's a minor. However, parents do have the authority to set household rules. But if those rules are causing harm or are based on inappropriate pressures (like the mom's comments about boys liking her), that could be an issue. \n\nThe daughter's reaction (telling the mom to stop projecting her insecurities) was harsh, but it came from a place of frustration. The mom's behavior might have been the root cause of the conflict. The daughter isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially if it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. The parents are enforcing social norms that might not apply to the daughter's specific situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like the parents are overstepping by using punishment and making inappropriate comments. The daughter is standing up for her autonomy. While the parents have a right to set some rules, enforcing something that's unnecessary and causing emotional distress could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
