Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who doesn't wear a bra because she's a very small chested (A-cup) and finds bras uncomfortable. Her parents, especially her mom, are upset about it, using terms like \"gross\" and \"unladylike,\" and even threatening to not let her leave the house. The mom also makes comments about wanting her to be more feminine or attractive to boys. The author gets frustrated and confronts her mom, leading to an argument where the mom cries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's reasoning is that she doesn't have a large bust, so a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty. She's also a tomboy and not interested in fashion or dating. The parents are enforcing a norm that might not fit the author's body or personal preferences. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra, given her situation.\n\nFrom a rights and autonomy perspective, the author is making a personal choice about her body. She's of age where she's developing her own identity, and the parents are imposing their expectations. The parents' comments about wanting her to be more like a \"popular\" girl suggest possible body image issues or societal pressure being projected onto the daughter. The daughter's frustration stems from feeling like her parents are trying to make her conform to standards that don't apply to her due to her body type.\n\nHowever, societal norms might traditionally view wearing a bra as part of being feminine or modest. But the author's case is unique because she doesn't have the physical need for one. If she's comfortable and the issue is merely about parental pressure, then her stance could be justified. On the other hand, if there are cultural or family values that prioritize modesty regardless of body size, that's another angle.\n\nBut the problem here is the parents' reaction. They're making her feel bad about her body, which is a form of emotional pressure. The author's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to that pressure. The mom's comments about boys liking her and her disappointment in having a flat-chested daughter point to deeper issues than just bra-wearing. It's about self-image and maybe the mom's own insecurities.\n\nIn terms of the actual wrongdoing, the author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra. The parents are enforcing a rule that's unnecessary for the author's comfort and body type. The real issue is the parents' behavior, not the author's choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her right to make personal choices about her body without undue pressure from her parents.\n"
