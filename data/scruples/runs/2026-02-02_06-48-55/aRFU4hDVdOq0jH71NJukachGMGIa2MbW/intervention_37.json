Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small chest (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents insist she wear one for modesty and femininity, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty, but personal choice is also valued. However, the author's case is different because her body size makes bras seem unnecessary. The parents might be projecting their own expectations or societal pressures onto her.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to bodily autonomy versus the parents' concerns about societal norms. The author argues that her small size means bras aren't needed and that her parents are being judgmental. The parents are enforcing a rule that may not be practical for her. \n\nLegally, in many places, there's no law requiring women to wear bras in public. So the author isn't breaking any laws. The conflict is more about personal choice versus parental control. Since the author is a minor, parental guidance is expected, but there's a balance between parental authority and the child's autonomy. The author's maturity in understanding her body and preferences is clear. \n\nThe parents' comments about her being \"like a boy\" and their disappointment suggest deeper issues, possibly their own insecurities or societal pressures. The author's stance is about self-acceptance, which is valid. The punishment of not letting her leave the house without a bra seems excessive, especially when the author's choice doesn't affect others. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not in the wrong because she's making a personal choice about her body. The parents need to respect her autonomy, especially since the author's choice isn't harmful. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
