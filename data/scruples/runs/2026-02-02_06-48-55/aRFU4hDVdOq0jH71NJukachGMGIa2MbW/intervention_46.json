Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old who's flat-chested and doesn't find bras necessary. She's tomboyish and doesn't care about fashion or dating. Her parents, especially her mom, are pressuring her to wear a bra, using comments about wanting boys to like her and being feminine. The author feels the pressure is inappropriate and even lashes out when her mom sends her a video about increasing bust size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial context. In many societies, especially in certain conservative ones, there's an expectation for women to wear bras as part of modesty or being ladylike. The parents might be enforcing norms they grew up with, thinking it's about respectability. However, the author's reasoning is that since she's so small, there's no need for support or modesty, and the pressure comes from her mom's own insecurities. She also mentions that the mom is projecting her desires onto her daughter, which is a common issue in parent-child dynamics where parents have unmet expectations.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus parental authority. The author is of an age where she's seeking independence, and her parents are trying to enforce their standards. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asserting her own choice. Legally, there's no law against not wearing a bra in most places, so the author isn't violating any rules. Morally, it's about personal choice and body autonomy. The parents are using emotional pressure and punishment (not letting her leave the house), which is more problematic. The author's anger towards the mom seems justified if the mom is being inconsiderate of her daughter's comfort and body image.\n\nAlso, the author's body type is a factor. Since she's an A-cup and barely has a chest, the argument that a bra is necessary for support is weak. The parents might be enforcing a norm without considering the individual's needs. The mom's comments about boys liking her or being more feminine could be pushing a traditional gender role that the daughter doesn't want to conform to. The daughter's identity as a tomboy and her disinterest in fashion suggest that the pressure to wear a bra is conflicting with her self-expression.\n\nThe daughter's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to the mom's emotional manipulation. She accuses her mom of projecting her own insecurities, which could be a valid point. The mom's crying after the daughter's outburst might indicate that the daughter's words struck a nerve, but the daughter's frustration is understandable given the ongoing pressure.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, body autonomy is a significant factor. The daughter has the right to make decisions about her own body, especially when it doesn't harm others. The parents' arguments are more about societal expectations and their own desires rather than the daughter's well-being. Therefore, the parents might be in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy and using punitive measures. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her choice, even if it goes against traditional norms.\n"
