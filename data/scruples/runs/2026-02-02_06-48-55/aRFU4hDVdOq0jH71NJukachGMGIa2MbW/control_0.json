Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is a 17-year-old who's barely an A-cup, describes herself as tomboyish and studious, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are insisting she wear a bra, making comments about femininity and boys liking her, and even punishing her by not letting her leave the house without one. The author feels that her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that the mom's reactions are inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The parents' perspective is that a bra is underwear and not wearing one is gross. They might be trying to instill societal norms about modesty and femininity. However, the author is very clear that she's not interested in conforming to these expectations and that she's comfortable with her body. The key points here are autonomy, body image, and parental overreach.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal choice and comfort. She has a small chest, so she doesn't see the necessity of a bra for support or modesty. The parents' concern might stem from traditional views on how girls should present themselves, possibly influenced by their own values or societal pressures. The conflict arises from differing values: the parents want their daughter to adhere to certain standards, while the daughter is asserting her right to make her own decisions about her body.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many Western societies, not wearing a bra is becoming more accepted, especially among younger generations who prioritize comfort and personal choice. However, in some contexts, especially more conservative ones, there might still be stigma. The author's parents might be coming from a place where these norms are strict, but the daughter is pushing back against what she perceives as unnecessary pressure.\n\nThe parents' actions\u2014yelling, punishing, making disparaging comments\u2014could be seen as overbearing. They're using emotional manipulation (like saying she should want boys to like her) and control (not letting her leave the house) to enforce their views. This could be harmful, especially for a teenager who is developing her own identity.\n\nThe author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to this pressure. She's standing up for herself, which is important. The fact that she's 17 means she's in a transitional phase where asserting independence is typical. The mom's reaction to the author's outburst\u2014crying\u2014might indicate deeper issues, perhaps her own insecurities about not meeting societal expectations as a parent or about her daughter's nonconformity.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is in her right to make choices about her own body. The parents have a duty to respect her autonomy as she grows into adulthood. However, there's also the aspect of teaching social norms. The question is whether the parents are just trying to prepare her for societal expectations or if they're being overbearing.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the user is asking for a judgment. The key factors are the parents' overreaction versus the daughter's right to personal choice. Since the author isn't causing harm to others and is making a personal choice about her body, especially given her small chest size where a bra isn't necessary for support, it's more likely that the parents are in the wrong for enforcing their views in a harmful way. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her own comfort and autonomy.\n"
