Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds bras uncomfortable. Her parents are upset and think it's inappropriate, even going as far as not letting her leave the house without one. The girl feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities and being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl's perspective: she's young, not interested in fashion, has a small chest, and finds bras unnecessary. She's asserting her body autonomy and rejecting her mother's expectations. The parents' side: they believe that a bra is underwear and necessary for modesty, comparing it to other forms of underwear. They might be trying to prepare her for societal norms where dressing a certain way is expected.\n\nLegally, in many places, there's no law requiring wearing a bra. It's a personal choice. However, societal norms can vary. In some contexts, like formal settings, going without a bra might be seen as inappropriate. But the girl is talking about casual settings with friends and at home, which is different.\n\nThe parents' concern might stem from wanting to prepare her for the real world where others might judge. But the girl is in her teens, still developing her identity. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine could be imposing her own values on the daughter, which the daughter is resisting.\n\nThe daughter's outburst about her mother's projections is strong, but given the context, she's standing up for herself against pressure. The mother's reaction (crying) shows emotional distress, but the daughter feels justified in her stance.\n\nConsidering all this, the conflict is between personal autonomy and parental expectations. The girl isn't harming anyone by choosing not to wear a bra in casual situations. The parents' strict enforcement, especially punishing her, could be seen as overbearing. The girl's right to make her own decisions about her body, especially as a teenager, is important. However, there's a balance between autonomy and respecting parental guidance. But in this case, the parents seem to be using shame and punishment, which might be excessive.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's her body and her choice, especially in informal contexts. The parents are being unreasonable by making it a big issue.\n"
