Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to wear a bra. The author is 17, a minor, with a very small chest size (barely an A-cup). She's described as tomboyish, not interested in fashion or dating, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents believe bras are essential undergarments and get upset when she doesn't wear one, using remarks about femininity and boys liking her. The author feels the pressure is unwarranted and confronted her mom, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms regarding wearing bras. In many Western cultures, especially in certain contexts like work or formal settings, bras are considered standard for modesty and support. However, for someone with a very small chest, the necessity is questionable. The author's argument is that since she has minimal chest size, a bra isn't needed for support or modesty, making it a personal choice.\n\nNext, the parents' stance is rooted in their belief that bras are essential, possibly influenced by their own values or societal expectations. They may be trying to prepare her for social norms or their perception of how women should present themselves. However, their approach includes controlling behavior (not letting her leave the house without a bra) and making her feel ashamed about her body, which can be harmful.\n\nThe author's reaction to her mother sending a video about exercises to enhance her appearance might indicate feeling pressured to conform to beauty standards. Her outburst could stem from frustration with these pressures, especially if she feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFrom a rights and autonomy perspective, especially since the author is a teenager, there's a balance between parental guidance and personal freedom. Parents have a responsibility to guide minors, but they also need to respect the child's autonomy as they develop their own identity. The author's choice not to wear a bra is a personal one, and the parents' punishment (not letting her leave without one) could be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is not being harmed and the choice is about personal comfort and identity.\n\nAdditionally, body positivity and self-acceptance are important factors. The author is asserting her right to be comfortable in her own skin, which is a valid stance. The mother's comments about femininity and boys liking her might be perpetuating harmful stereotypes about what a woman should look like to be accepted.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respecting parental authority. As a minor, the author is expected to follow certain household rules. The conflict here is between her autonomy and her parents' rules. But the parents' methods (punishment, criticism) might be contributing to a toxic environment rather than a healthy discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have a right to set rules, their approach here seems to infringe on the author's autonomy and self-expression. The author's choice not to wear a bra, given her body type and personal comfort, isn't inherently wrong. The parents' reaction, however, might be the issue.\n"
