Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The situation is that the author is a 17-year-old with a very small bust size (A-cup) and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents think it's improper and won't let her leave the house without one. The parents also make comments about wanting her to be more feminine and be liked by boys. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, it's common to wear a bra for support and modesty, but this varies. The author's situation is that her size is so small that bras are bulky and uncomfortable. There's a debate here between personal comfort and parental expectations.\n\nThen there's the parental behavior. The parents are enforcing this rule strictly, not allowing her to leave without a bra, and making comments that imply she's not feminine enough. The mom sent a video about exercises to make breasts look bigger, which the author finds intrusive. The parent's approach seems controlling and possibly using body image issues to push their own ideals onto the daughter.\n\nThe author is asserting her autonomy, which is a key point. She's a teenager forming her own identity, and her parents are trying to dictate her choices in a way that's causing conflict. The mom's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be contributing to the pressure. The author's outburst was in the heat of the moment, but she acknowledges that the mom was out of line. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, parents have the right to set household rules, but they also need to respect their child's autonomy as they mature. However, the mom's behavior seems to cross into body-shaming and using emotional manipulation. The author's small size makes the bra issue less about support and more about societal expectations, which the author is rejecting.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mental health. The parent's criticism could be affecting the author's self-esteem. She's stating she's okay with her body, and the mom is trying to make her feel bad about it. The author's refusal to wear a bra is a form of self-acceptance, while the mom is pushing her to conform to certain beauty standards.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about personal choice and parental overreach. The author isn't harming anyone by not wearing a bra, especially with her small size. The parents are enforcing a rule that's causing emotional distress. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's her body and her choice, especially when the parents are being overly controlling and body-shaming.\n"
