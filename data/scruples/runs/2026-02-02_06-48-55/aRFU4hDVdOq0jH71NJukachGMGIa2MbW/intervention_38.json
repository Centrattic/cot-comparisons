Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she's an A-cup and finds them uncomfortable. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, giving comments about being feminine and how boys should like her. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that it's unnecessary since she has a small chest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she's a young woman with a small chest size, so a bra might not be necessary for support. She finds it uncomfortable and doesn't see the point in wearing one. She also resents her mom's comments about her body and the pressure to conform to certain feminine standards. Her argument is that her choice to not wear a bra is a personal decision, especially since others don't seem to care. She even stood up to her mom when she received unwanted advice about exercises, which she felt was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents believe that a bra is underwear, so not wearing one is considered gross. They might be concerned about modesty and societal norms. The mother's comments about being more feminine and wanting boys to like her could stem from traditional expectations about women's appearance. They might feel that not wearing a bra is a sign of being lazy or not taking care of oneself. The parent's reaction, like not letting her leave the house without a bra, shows they see it as a rule to be followed.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, wearing a bra is seen as a standard undergarment for support and modesty, but if the garment isn't necessary due to body size, that could be a valid reason not to wear it. The author is asserting her autonomy over her body, which is a significant point. However, the parents are enforcing their standards, possibly due to their own beliefs about femininity and propriety.\n\nThe key factors here are personal autonomy versus parental authority. The author is at an age where she's developing her own identity, and her parents might feel they need to guide her. But is not wearing a bra inherently wrong? If it's comfortable and appropriate for the situation, maybe not. The author's small size means there's minimal support needed, and if she's not causing harm to herself or others, it's more of a personal choice. The parents might not be considering her comfort and personal beliefs, instead imposing their standards.\n\nThe author's outburst about her mom projecting insecurities could be a reaction to feeling misunderstood or judged. Her mom's comment about boys liking her might also tie into societal pressures the mother feels. The daughter is resisting these pressures, which could be seen as a positive aspect of self-acceptance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't hurting anyone by not wearing a bra if she's physically able and it's appropriate for her body. The parents are trying to enforce their values, which might not be the best approach if they're causing emotional distress. However, parents do have a role in guiding their children, but the line is crossed when it's done in a way that's harmful or controlling. The mother's reaction of crying shows the emotional weight, but the daughter's right to make her own decisions is also important.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her body and comfort, and the parents are overstepping by using that as a reason to restrict her movements. The mother's comments about femininity and boys could be contributing to the daughter's discomfort and lack of interest in those aspects. The author's stance on her own body image seems healthy, whereas the mother's approach might be projecting her own issues. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
