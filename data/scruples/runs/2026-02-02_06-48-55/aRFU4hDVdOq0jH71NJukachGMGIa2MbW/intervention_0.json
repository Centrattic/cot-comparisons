Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't wear a bra because she has a very small chest (A-cup, but she says she's barely that). Her parents are upset and make her wear one, threatening to not let her leave the house if she doesn't. The daughter feels the rules are unnecessary and that her mom is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms. In many Western societies, wearing a bra is common for women, especially in public. But there's also a growing movement where some women choose not to wear them for comfort or personal choice. However, the key here is the age and the parent's involvement. The parents are enforcing this as a rule, not just a suggestion.\n\nThe daughter is 17, which means she's approaching adulthood. At this age, there's a balance between parental guidance and personal autonomy. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave) for not following their rules. The daughter argues that the rules are illogical because her chest size is so small that a bra isn't necessary. There's also the emotional aspect where the daughter feels her mom is disappointed in her for not being more feminine or popular.\n\nI should think about the reasoning on both sides. The parents might be trying to instill modesty or prepare her for societal expectations. The daughter is asserting her right to body autonomy and personal comfort. The mother's comments about boys liking her or wanting her to be more feminine could be problematic, as it's pressuring the daughter to conform to certain beauty standards, which the daughter resents.\n\nThe daughter's response of telling her mom to stop projecting her insecurities might come off as harsh, but it's in response to what she perceives as unfair pressure. The question is whether the daughter is wrong for not wearing a bra. If the parents are using excessive control or emotional manipulation, then the daughter's resistance could be justified. However, the daughter is also a teenager, so there's a point where respecting parental rules is expected, unless those rules are harmful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, not wearing a bra isn't illegal or inherently wrong, but it can be a matter of personal choice and cultural expectations. If the parents are enforcing this without considering the daughter's comfort and body type, they might be overstepping. The daughter's argument that there's nothing to support and that the rule is unnecessary adds weight to her side.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? If the parents are being unreasonable and the daughter's choice is based on her body type and comfort, then maybe not. However, if the daughter's refusal leads to conflict and disregard for parental guidance, there's a case for her being in the wrong. But given the context of the mother's comments and the daughter's valid reasons, the answer might lean towards the daughter not being in the wrong.\n"
