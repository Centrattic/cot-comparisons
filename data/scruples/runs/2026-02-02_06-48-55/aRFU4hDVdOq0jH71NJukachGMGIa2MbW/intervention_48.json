Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra when her parents insist she should. The author is 17, has a very small chest, and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents, especially her mom, are pushing her to wear one, linking it to being feminine and being liked by boys. The author feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, especially in Western contexts, it's common for women to wear bras for modesty and support. However, the author's case is unique because she has a very small chest size. Bras might not be necessary for support, and the societal expectation might not apply as strictly here. The parent's insistence could be based on traditional views on modesty, but the author's perspective is about personal comfort and autonomy.\n\nNext, the parent's perspective: they might believe they're preparing her for societal expectations. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine suggest she's projecting her own ideals onto her daughter. The parent's behavior of not letting her leave the house unless she wears a bra is overstepping, as it's a form of control based on what the parent believes is right, not considering the daughter's comfort and autonomy.\n\nThe author's response, though heated, seems to come from frustration. She's asserting her right to body autonomy and rejecting her mother's expectations. While she could have handled the argument more calmly, her stance on self-determination is valid. The key issue here is the balance between parental guidance and personal freedom. At 17, the author is approaching adulthood and should have more say in her body choices.\n\nAlso, the parent's reaction to the author's small chest size, implying disappointment in not having a \"popular\" daughter, points to the parent's own insecurities and unrealistic expectations. The author is standing up for herself against these pressures, which is a positive step towards self-acceptance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is a bit subjective. However, the parent is enforcing a norm that doesn't apply to the author's physical reality and personal preferences. The author isn't violating any laws or social norms that significantly impact others; it's her body and her choice. The parent's insistence is more about their own values conflicting with the daughter's autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra, especially when it's not necessary for her and she's standing up for her own comfort and identity.\n"
