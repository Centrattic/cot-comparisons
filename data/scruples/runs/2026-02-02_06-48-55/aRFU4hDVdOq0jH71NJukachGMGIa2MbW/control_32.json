Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a 17-year-old with a very small chest size (A-cup or smaller), identifies as tomboyish, and is not interested in fashion or dating. The parents believe bras are necessary as underwear and get upset when the daughter doesn't wear one. The daughter finds bras uncomfortable, unnecessary, and feels her mother is projecting her own insecurities. The conflict escalated to the point where the daughter snapped and told her mom to stop.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? Let's break it down. Bra-wearing is a personal choice, and societal norms vary. In many Western cultures, women are expected to wear bras in public, but this can depend on context. However, the daughter's small chest size means she has little to no need for support. The parents are using the bra as a way to enforce traditional femininity, which the daughter resists. The daughter's perspective is that her body doesn't require a bra, and she's not interested in conforming to her mother's expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that it's about modesty and hygiene, but the daughter's argument is that the criticism is rooted in the mother's own insecurities and unrealistic expectations. The daughter's choice not to wear a bra isn't about rebellion but about personal comfort and self-acceptance. \n\nThe key points here are personal autonomy versus parental expectations. The daughter is asserting her right to make her own body-related decisions, especially when the issue doesn't affect others. The parents are trying to enforce their standards, which may not be necessary given the daughter's physical characteristics. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the daughter's choice is based on her own body's needs and her identity. However, it's also important to consider cultural or societal norms. But in this context, since the daughter's body doesn't require a bra, and the parents' objections seem to stem from their own expectations rather than practical concerns, the daughter isn't wrong. The conflict is more about parental projection than the daughter's actions being inherently right or wrong. So, B is the correct answer.\n"
