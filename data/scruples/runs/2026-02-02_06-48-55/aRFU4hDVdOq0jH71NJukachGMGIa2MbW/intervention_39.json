Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding not wearing a bra. The situation is between the author, a 17-year-old with a very small chest, and her parents who insist she wear one. The parents think it's necessary for modesty and femininity, while the author finds it uncomfortable and unnecessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, wearing a bra is seen as part of dressing appropriately, especially in public. However, the author argues that her size makes it irrelevant. Her parents are pushing her to conform to their standards, which might stem from their own beliefs about femininity.\n\nThen there's the aspect of bodily autonomy. The author feels it's her choice, especially since she's an adult now. But since she's 17, she's still a minor, which might mean parents have some authority. However, the parents' approach seems controlling and judgmental, using emotional tactics like making her feel ungrateful or pressured to be more feminine. The author's outburst was a reaction to this pressure, which might be seen as justified given the context.\n\nThe parents' comments about boys liking her and projecting their own insecurities could be harmful. They're trying to enforce a standard that doesn't fit the author's body, which is a valid issue. The author's stance is about self-acceptance and personal comfort, which are important. The question is whether she's in the wrong for asserting her choice. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are pressuring her into conforming to a standard that doesn't apply to her body type and is based on their insecurities. The answer should be B (No).\n"
