Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 17-year-old girl who doesn't want to wear a bra because she has a very small chest size (A-cup) and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are pressuring her to wear one, saying it's gross not to, and they bring up things like wanting to be more feminine and for boys to like her. The girl feels her mom is projecting her own insecurities and that it's not a big deal since she's flat-chested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and societal norms around wearing bras. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, it's common for women to wear bras for support and modesty. However, the appropriateness can vary based on context, clothing, and personal preference. Since the girl is very small-chested, a bra might not be necessary for her. If she's not wearing revealing clothes and is covered by layers, not wearing a bra might not be an issue for others.\n\nThe parents' stance is that it's a form of underwear and not wearing it is \"gross.\" But underwear typically refers to undergarments that cover the torso and groin area. A bra is part of that, but if the bra isn't providing coverage that's necessary (because she's a small size), maybe the necessity is questionable. The parents are also pushing her to be more feminine, which could be about societal expectations of women. However, the girl identifies as tomboyish and doesn't care about fashion or dating. It's important to respect individual identity and autonomy.\n\nThe girl's argument is about her comfort and her right to make decisions about her body. She's not causing harm to others by not wearing a bra, and her parents are trying to enforce their views, which might be based on their own insecurities or societal pressures. The mom's comments about boys liking her and her disappointment in her daughter's body image could be projecting their own desires onto the child.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's body, the relevance of societal norms, and the parents' overreach in enforcing their views. The girl is of age where she's developing her own identity, and her parents are restricting her freedom based on their opinions. The girl isn't violating any laws or causing direct harm, so the argument is more about personal choice versus parental control.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girl isn't in the wrong for choosing not to wear a bra if she's comfortable and it's appropriate for her body type. The parents, on the other hand, might be enforcing outdated or unrealistic standards. The girl's right to make decisions about her own body, especially as she's approaching adulthood, is a significant factor here. The parents' punishment for not wearing a bra (not letting her leave the house) is more about control than a valid reason. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
