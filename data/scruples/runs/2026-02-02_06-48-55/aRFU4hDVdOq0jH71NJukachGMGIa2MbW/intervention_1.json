Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wearing a bra. The author is 17, has a very small bust (barely an A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable and unnecessary. Her parents are upset, saying it's gross not to wear one and make comments about femininity. The mother even sent a video about exercises to make her look more prominent, which the author found intrusive.\n\nFirst, the author is a minor, so her parents have some authority in guiding her. However, the parents' approach seems harsh. They're making the author feel ashamed for her body, which is a concern. The mother's comments about boys liking her and projecting her own insecurities are problematic. The author is asserting her right to her body and how she wants to present herself, which is valid. \n\nLegally, there's no law against not wearing a bra. The parents are using punishment (not letting her leave the house) over a personal choice. The author's stance is about comfort and self-acceptance, which are important, especially during adolescence. However, the author did lose her temper and accused the mother of projecting insecurities, which might be a bit harsh. But considering the mother's actions, it's understandable. \n\nThe core issue is autonomy vs. parental control. The parents might be trying to enforce traditional norms, but the author is resisting. Since the author is an adult in many places (17 is almost 18), her autonomy is a significant factor. The parents' methods here are overbearing and could be harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself.\n"
