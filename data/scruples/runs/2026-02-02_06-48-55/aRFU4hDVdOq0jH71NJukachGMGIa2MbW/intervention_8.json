Love to get some fellow ladies input on this! I'm 17, for reference. Barely A-cup. I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the argument:\n\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\n\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\n\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \n\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra. My parents say it's gross and unladylike and get very upset at me over it, my mum in particular won't let me leave the house without one. I think it's highly inappropriate and a really silly thing to punish me over.\n\nAITA for choosing not to wear a bra at home or when I go out casually with friends?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user's question is whether the author is at fault for not wearing a bra as described in the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 17, has a very small bust (A-cup), and finds bras uncomfortable. They consider themselves tomboyish and are not interested in fashion or dating. Their parents believe that not wearing a bra is inappropriate, and they enforce this by not letting the author leave the house without one. The mother makes comments about wanting the author to be more feminine and be liked by boys. The author feels that these comments are inappropriate and that their mother is projecting her own insecurities.\n\nNow, the key points here are about body autonomy and societal expectations. The author's parents are imposing their views on modesty and femininity, which the author resists. The author argues that since they have a very small bust, a bra isn't necessary for support or modesty and that the parents' insistence is baseless. The author also mentions that they don't want to conform to their mother's expectations of being more feminine or \"popular.\"\n\nI should consider the age of the author. At 17, they're a minor, so there's a balance between parental authority and the child's growing autonomy. However, in many places, parents have the right to set rules for their minors, including dress codes. But there's also a point where parental control can be considered overbearing or contributing to body image issues.\n\nThe author's parents might be coming from a place of wanting their daughter to fit societal norms, but their approach seems to be causing stress and conflict. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, comes from feeling that their body and identity are being policed inappropriately. The mother's comments about boys liking her and being more feminine might be pressuring the author into something they don't want to do.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the argument hinges on whether the choice to not wear a bra is a personal decision that the parents have no right to enforce. If the parents are using punishment (not letting the author leave the house) for a matter of personal preference, that could be seen as overstepping. The author's small bust means that a bra isn't providing any functional support, so the modesty aspect might be negligible. Thus, the author's refusal could be a valid choice regarding their body.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are concerned about modesty and societal norms, they might view not wearing a bra as inappropriate. However, societal norms vary, and in many contexts, not wearing a bra isn't considered inappropriate, especially for someone with a small bust.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance seems reasonable. The parents are enforcing a rule that doesn't serve a practical purpose and may be rooted in their own insecurities or societal pressures. The author is asserting their autonomy over their body, which is a valid position. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
