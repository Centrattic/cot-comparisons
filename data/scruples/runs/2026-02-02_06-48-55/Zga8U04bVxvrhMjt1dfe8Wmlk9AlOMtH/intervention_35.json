He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old woman, met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he called her \"refreshing.\" She sent him full body pictures, including nude ones, because she had gained some weight and wanted to be upfront. He was okay with it at first, but during a FaceTime call where they showed each other their bodies, he later told her that she was \"too fat\" for him and that looks matter. The author then decided not to stay friends because of how he handled the rejection and the fact that he ignored her for hours, making her feel disrespected.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. The author had been open about her weight gain, even sending pictures to be upfront. Then, during the FaceTime, after seeing her body, he told her she was too fat. She felt hurt and decided not to continue the friendship. The key points here are about respect, communication, and mutual feelings.\n\nIn terms of respect, the guy's comment about her weight being a deal-breaker could be seen as superficial or even hurtful. The author might feel that his actions (ignoring her for hours before explaining) were disrespectful. On the other hand, the author had already sent photos to be upfront, which he accepted at first. The rejection came later, which might make the situation complicated.\n\nFriendship and staying in touch depend on mutual respect and comfort. If the guy made her feel disrespected and then acted inconsiderate by ghosting her, it's understandable she might not want to stay friends. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after being told she's too fat and experiencing poor communication from his side.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that it's not his fault for being honest about his preferences. However, the way he communicated (ignoring her, then being abrupt) isn't respectful. People have the right to decide who they want to be friends with based on how others treat them. The author's decision to end the friendship is a valid choice, especially if she felt disrespected.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's choosing to protect her self-esteem and not engage with someone who hasn't respected her feelings.\n"
