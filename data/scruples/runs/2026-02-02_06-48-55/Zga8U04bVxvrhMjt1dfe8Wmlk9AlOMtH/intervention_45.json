He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old female who met a guy on Tinder. They hit it off, talked a lot, and he was into her personality. She even sent him full body and nude pictures to be upfront about her weight gain. The guy then asked her to show her body during a FaceTime call, and when she did, he responded by saying that she's a bigger girl, implying that her weight was an issue. He ignored her for hours before finally telling her he wasn't into her because she was too fat. The author then decided not to stay friends with him because of how he handled the situation\u2014ignoring her for hours, not being respectful, and rejecting her based on her size. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I should consider the guy's actions. He made a comment about her weight being an issue and ignored her for hours before responding. That's pretty rude and hurtful. The author felt disrespected and upset, which is understandable. People have the right to set boundaries, especially after being treated poorly. The guy's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship with someone who disrespects her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as cutting off a potential conversation or giving him a chance to explain. But given the context\u2014being rejected for her weight and his poor communication\u2014many might agree she's justified in not wanting to stay friends. Also, the guy admitted that looks matter to him and rejected her, which is a personal choice, but his handling of it was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. She's protecting her feelings after being treated with disrespect. The guy's actions were the problematic ones here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
