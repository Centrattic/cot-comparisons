He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy they met on Tinder who initially seemed to like her personality. They had a good connection and even talked on the phone until late. Then, during a FaceTime call, the guy wanted to see her body. She had sent him full-body and nude pictures already, so maybe that's part of the context. She gained some weight but was upfront about it, and they both mentioned being in the process of losing weight.\n\nWhen she showed her body during FaceTime, she left abruptly, which made him say she was insecure because she's a bigger girl. Then he ignored her for hours before finally texting that he's into looks and she was too fat. She decided not to continue the friendship, and he was upset about that. The author feels the guy was rude and didn't respect her after rejecting her, leading her to not want to stay friends.\n\nFirst, the guy's behavior: he rejected her for her body and ignored her for hours before finally explaining. That's pretty bad because ignoring someone after a rejection can be hurtful. The author sent him her photos upfront, so she was honest. When he saw her in person (or via FaceTime), he made a comment about her size. She was already working on losing weight, which shows she's trying. The guy could have been more respectful in his rejection. \n\nThe author's reaction: she left the conversation and then, when he finally responded, she decided it's over. He wanted to continue talking, but she didn't. The question is if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. \n\nFrom a friendship standpoint, after such a rejection and the way he handled it (ignoring her, making a comment about her weight), it's understandable that she feels hurt and doesn't want to continue the relationship. People have the right to end a friendship if they feel disrespected. The guy's actions (ignoring, then being blunt about looks) were unkind. The author isn't obligated to remain friends with someone who made her feel bad. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that since he clarified it was a matter of preference, not a personal attack, she should still be friends. However, the way he handled it was poor. The author's feelings are valid here. She prioritized her self-respect after being hurt, which is reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
