He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, and she even sent him explicit photos to be upfront about her weight gain. They face-timed, he saw her body, and then he rejected her by saying she's too fat. She felt hurt, especially because he ignored her for hours before finally texting that looks matter for him. She decided to cut off contact, and now she's wondering if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy initially seemed into her, right? They had a good connection, talked a lot. She was upfront about her weight gain, which shows she was honest and transparent. That's a good move because it's important to be clear about expectations and physical appearance if that's a factor. He saw her body, so he couldn't have been surprised. But then, when he rejected her, he didn't communicate it directly. Instead, he ignored her for hours. That's a bit shady. Ghosting or stonewalling is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging and not knowing what's going on. So, his behavior here is questionable.\n\nThe author felt disrespected because he didn't just come out and say it. She gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they could continue talking, but when he finally did respond, it was about her weight. She then decided to end the contact, which is her right. People can choose who they want to interact with, especially after such a rejection. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. Well, he rejected her based on her body, which is a personal and sensitive issue. She's already dealing with stress and weight concerns, so this must have been hurtful. Ending contact because of how he handled the rejection seems reasonable. There's no obligation to stay friends after being rejected, especially when the rejection is based on appearance. \n\nAlso, his handling of the situation\u2014ignoring her for hours instead of being upfront\u2014probably made her feel worse. She didn't wrong him; he was the one who dismissed her after a connection. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's justified in her decision to cut ties. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the guy had a right to his opinion, but the way he communicated it was poor. The author isn't at fault for standing up for herself and prioritizing her feelings. So, the answer should be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
