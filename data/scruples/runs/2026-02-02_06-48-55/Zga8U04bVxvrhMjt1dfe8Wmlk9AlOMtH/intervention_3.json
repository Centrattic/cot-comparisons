He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who initially liked her personality but later rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" The author was upfront about her weight gain, sent pictures, and even a nude photo. During a FaceTime call, he asked her to show her body, and after she did, he told her he was upset, ignored her for hours, and then said looks matter for him. She then decided not to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy was attracted to her personality at first and showed interest. But when it came to physical appearance, he rejected her. The author was honest about her weight gain, which is a big point in her favor. She even took the initiative to be transparent by sending full-body photos, which is a responsible approach. \n\nThen, during the FaceTime, after she showed her body, he made a comment about her being a \"bigger girl.\" That's pretty direct and could be hurtful. The fact that he ignored her for hours before finally expressing his feelings about her weight is problematic. People often say that communication is key in relationships, and his lack of immediate response might have made her feel devalued or confused. \n\nThe author's reaction is to not want to stay friends because of how he handled the rejection. That's a personal choice, but is it justified? Well, if he was rude and didn't communicate properly, it's reasonable for her to feel disrespected and choose to cut ties, even if it's a friend situation. Also, considering the emotional toll and how his actions made her feel worse about herself, it might be a valid decision to protect her own well-being. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's the case. The guy's rejection based on weight could be seen as shallow, but people have different priorities. However, his method of handling the rejection by ignoring her and then making a comment might be more about how he communicated rather than the content itself. \n\nThe author was already in the process of losing weight and was open about it. His comment about her size after she was honest might not be the issue as much as the way he delivered it and the delay in communication. People can have different views on body image, but the way he treated her during the interaction is important. \n\nIn relationships, respect is crucial. If someone feels that their partner or potential partner is being disrespectful or not communicative, it's understandable to step back. The author's choice to not continue a friendship after such treatment is her right. So, from this perspective, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The guy's behavior\u2014ignoring her and then expressing his feelings after a long time\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She acted to protect her self-esteem after a disrespectful interaction, and it's valid to prioritize one's mental health in such situations.\n"
