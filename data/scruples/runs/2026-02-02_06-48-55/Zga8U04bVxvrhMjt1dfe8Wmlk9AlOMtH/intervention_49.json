He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a guy who rejected the woman because she was \"too fat,\" and the woman is now considering whether she's at fault for not wanting to stay friends.\n\nFirst, the guy initially seemed into her personality and they had a good connection. She was upfront about her weight gain and even sent pictures. When they face-timed, he wanted to see her body and then criticized her for it. He also ignored her for hours before finally admitting that looks matter to him and she's too fat. The woman is upset because of the way he handled the rejection\u2014being rude and leaving her hanging. She decided not to stay friends because of how he treated her.\n\nThe woman is asking if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her based on her body. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nI think the key points here are about respect and how the guy handled the rejection. The guy didn't communicate his feelings directly, ignored her, and then blamed her insecurities. The woman's decision to not stay friends is a reaction to his disrespectful behavior. She's prioritizing her self-esteem and mental health by cutting ties with someone who devalued her. It's important to consider that people have the right to set boundaries after being treated poorly. So, she's not in the wrong for choosing not to maintain a friendship where she felt disrespected.\n"
