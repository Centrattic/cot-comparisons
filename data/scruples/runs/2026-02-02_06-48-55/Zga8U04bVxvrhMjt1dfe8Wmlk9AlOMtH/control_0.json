He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman who met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he called her refreshing. She had gained some weight (from 150 to 180 lbs) and was upfront about it by sending full body pics, even nude ones. The guy was into her initially. Then during a facetime, he asked her to show her body again. She did, but she said goodbye abruptly. He responded by saying she was \"a bigger girl,\" leading her to ask if he wanted to keep talking. He ignored her for hours, and she took that as a rejection. Later, he admitted he thought she was too fat and that looks mattered. She decided not to stay friends because of his handling of the situation, including ignoring her and then being upset when she distanced herself.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The guy rejected her based on her weight, even though she was upfront. He ignored her for hours, then explained his reasons. The author felt disrespected and didn't want to remain friends. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if someone rejects you for superficial reasons and treats you poorly, it's reasonable to cut ties. The guy was honest, but his actions (ignoring her, leading her on) were rude. The author's reaction seems justified. She's not obligated to stay friends with someone who belittled her and acted disrespectfully. \n\nAlso, the author took steps to be honest about her body upfront, which shows she tried to set clear expectations. The guy's response was his choice, but handling it poorly doesn't make her wrong for walking away. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong). The guy's behavior was the issue here, not hers.\n"
