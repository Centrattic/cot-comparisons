He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a 21-year-old woman who met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and even had a phone call that went late into the night. The guy called her \"refreshing,\" which seems positive. The user has gained weight over the past year due to stress, and she was upfront with him, sending body pictures, including nude ones, so he could decide if he was physically attracted to her. He was, until a face-time session where he saw her body and then later told her he found her too fat. The key points here are that she was honest about her appearance, he had shown interest initially, and after seeing her, he rejected her based on her weight. \n\nShe then decided not to stay friends because of how he handled the rejection\u2014ignoring her for hours and then being upset when she didn't want to continue talking. She felt he didn't respect her anymore because of her size, which led to her decision to cut ties.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The guy rejected her because of her weight, which is a common issue, but it's also a personal preference. However, the way he handled the rejection\u2014ignoring her for hours and then being upset when she moved on\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author was upfront about her weight, which is important. She gave him the chance to accept her as she is, and he chose not to. If someone is rejected for a reason that's not about behavior but about appearance, it's reasonable for the person to feel hurt, but it's also valid to not want to continue a relationship where the other person prioritizes looks over personality. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for cutting ties. Friendships or relationships are mutual, and if one person's self-worth is contingent on the other person's approval, but when that approval is withdrawn, it's okay to distance oneself. The guy's actions (ignoring, then being upset) show poor communication, which can justify her decision. She's not obligated to maintain a friendship if the other person's behavior was hurtful. \n\nAlso, considering that the rejection was based on appearance, which the author was already aware of and had communicated openly, there's no deception here. The guy's issue is with his own preferences, but the way he handled the situation is problematic. The author's reaction is a valid response to being treated disrespectfully. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for choosing to end the connection.\n"
