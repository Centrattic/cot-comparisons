He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP met a guy on Tinder, they connected, and he seemed into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain and even sent him photos. They faced each other via video call, and he ended up being overweight too, but she accepted it. Then, when she showed her body, he commented that she was too fat, ignored her for hours, and later regretted cutting off communication.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and how each person handled the situation. The guy rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. He ignored her for hours, which can be seen as inconsiderate. The OP then decided not to continue the friendship, which is her right. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The guy's behavior was dismissive and hurtful. However, the OP sent her photos upfront and tried to be honest. The guy's rejection was based on physical appearance, which isn't uncommon in dating, but his handling of the rejection (ignoring for hours, being rude) is problematic. \n\nThe OP's reaction is understandable. She felt disrespected and upset. Choosing not to stay friends after such treatment isn't unreasonable. Friendships require mutual respect, and if one party is disrespectful, it's fair to distance oneself. So, the answer here would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
