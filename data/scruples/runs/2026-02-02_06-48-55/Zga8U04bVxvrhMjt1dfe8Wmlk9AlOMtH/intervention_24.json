He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

They connected, talked a lot, and he called her \"refreshing.\" She had gained some weight (from 150 to 180 lbs at 5'7\") and was upfront about it by sending full-body pictures, even nude ones. The guy was initially okay with that, then they faced-timed. She showed him her body, and he showed his. He was overweight, but she accepted that. They talked about wanting to lose weight together. \n\nAfter she showed him her body, he said she was a \"bigger girl,\" which made her insecure. She asked if he wanted to keep talking, and he ignored her for hours. She told him to take her silence as an answer. Later, he told her he thought looks mattered and she was too fat. She decided to leave him alone, but he was upset when she didn't want to stay friends. \n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with him after he rejected her for her weight. The user thinks she is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The guy initially seemed into her personality and their connection. He was okay with her weight when she was upfront about it. Then, after seeing her in person, he made a comment about her being a \"bigger girl,\" which she found hurtful. When she confronted him, he ignored her for hours. She interpreted that as rejection and then he told her she was too fat. She ended the conversation and didn't want to stay friends, which upset him.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The guy rejected her based on her weight, which is a common issue in relationships. He was initially fine with her weight but after seeing her, changed his stance. His behavior of ignoring her for hours and then making that comment could be seen as disrespectful. The author felt disrespected and hurt, which led her to cut off contact.\n\nIs she in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her for her body? Well, if someone rejects you for a superficial reason like weight, it's reasonable to feel hurt and not want to maintain a relationship. The guy's actions were dismissive and disrespectful, so the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nAlso, she was upfront about her weight from the start, so the rejection was after he saw her in person. The fact that he ignored her instead of being honest shows poor communication. The author is not in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who treated her that way. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when someone is disrespectful. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
