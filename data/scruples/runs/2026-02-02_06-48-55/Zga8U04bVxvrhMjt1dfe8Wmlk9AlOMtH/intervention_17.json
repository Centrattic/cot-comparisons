He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat,\" and she doesn't want to stay friends with him. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, and he was into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain, sent full-body pics, including nude, to be honest. During a FaceTime call, he asked her to show her body. She showed it and left abruptly. He then said she was \"too fat\" and ignored her for hours before finally texting to say looks matter. She felt hurt because he was rude, left her hanging, and then was upset when she didn't want to continue the relationship or be friends.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The guy rejected her based on her weight, which is problematic. He ignored her for hours, which could be seen as disrespectful. The woman felt disrespected and decided to end the interaction. From an ethical standpoint, if someone treats you badly and then you decide not to maintain a relationship with them, that's generally acceptable. People have the right to set boundaries and end relationships that are harmful or make them feel bad.\n\nHowever, maybe some would argue that he was just being honest about his preferences and she shouldn't punish him for that. But the issue here isn't just about him finding her too fat, but how he handled the rejection. He ignored her, leading to emotional distress, and then was upset when she reciprocated the rejection. That behavior is not respectful, and it's reasonable for her to not want to continue a friendship with someone who treated her that way.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people might say they want a friend, but if the other person is hurt and doesn't want to continue, it's not the hurt person's fault. The guy's actions were hurtful, so the woman isn't in the wrong for cutting off contact.\n\nI think the key here is the respect and the way he handled the rejection. While it's true that people have their preferences, the way he communicated and acted was toxic. The woman is justified in ending the relationship on her terms. Therefore, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
