He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe scenario involves a woman who met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he was into her personality. She shared her full body pictures, including nude, to be upfront about her weight gain. When they faced timed, he showed his body, which she found overweight but accepted because of their connection. Then, when she showed her body, he responded by saying she was too fat and ignored her for hours before finally breaking up. She decided not to stay friends because of how he handled it\u2014ignoring her, being rude, and rejecting her based on her weight. The key points here are his behavior after the rejection and her decision to cut ties.\n\nSo, the question is if she's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, she was honest about her weight gain, which is a responsible action. She gave him the chance to decide if he was comfortable. Then, when he rejected her, he did so poorly\u2014ignoring her for hours and being blunt. She felt disrespected and decided not to continue the friendship because of the way he treated her. \n\nIn terms of the rejection, it's his choice to end things based on her appearance, but the way he did it was rude. She's not obligated to stay friends with someone who treated her poorly. Also, considering the emotional impact, it's valid for her to set boundaries. \n\nHe was the one who initiated the relationship, then mishandled the rejection. Her response is about self-respect and protecting her feelings. There's no indication she did anything wrong here. She was upfront, and his behavior was the issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
