He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her for being \"too fat.\" I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. The author, a 21-year-old woman, met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he called her \"refreshing.\" She had gained weight (from 150 to 180 lbs) due to stress but was upfront about it by sending full-body pictures, including nude ones. The guy seemed okay with that initially. Then, during a video call where they both showed each other their bodies, the guy later told her he's a \"looks person\" and she's too fat. He ignored her for hours after she abruptly left the call, and when she said she'd leave him alone, he became upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was honest about her weight gain, the guy initially showed interest despite her weight, then later rejected her based on her size. He ignored her for hours, leading to her feeling disrespected. She decided not to stay friends with him after his behavior. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The question is about whether she is justified in cutting off contact. The guy's rejection based on her weight and his handling of the situation (ignoring her, then being upset when she distances herself) are central. The author's decision is based on feeling disrespected and hurt. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and respect. The guy's comment about her being too fat and his behavior of ignoring her could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response is a valid reaction to being treated poorly. She was upfront, and the guy changed his stance, which is his issue. Her choice to not stay friends is about self-respect in this case. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's responding to someone who disrespected her, and it's reasonable to cut ties with someone who is judgmental and inconsiderate.\n"
