He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected them because they were \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The woman met someone on Tinder, they connected well, and she was upfront about her weight gain. She sent full-body pics, including nude, to be honest about her appearance. When they face-timed, he asked her to show her body. She did, then left abruptly. He later told her he found her too fat, and during that time, he ignored her for hours before finally texting his feelings. She felt he was being rude and disrespectful, so she decided not to stay friends.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The guy admitted that looks matter and found her too fat, which is a common but hurtful reason to reject someone. The woman was honest about her appearance and even showed him, so there was no deception. The guy's response was to ignore her for hours instead of being upfront, which is inconsiderate and could be seen as disrespectful. The woman felt he treated her poorly, especially after she was vulnerable. \n\nWhen someone is rejected, especially based on physical appearance, and the other person handles it poorly (like ghosting for hours), it's understandable for the person to not want to maintain a friendship. The woman's decision to cut ties is about her self-respect and emotional well-being. The question is whether she's in the wrong for prioritizing her feelings over staying friends with someone who was dismissive and contributed to her feeling bad about herself.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who acted inconsiderately. Here, the guy's behavior (ignoring, then dismissing her feelings) is problematic. The woman's response is a reaction to his actions, so she's not the one at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
