He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is a 21-year-old woman who met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he even called her \"refreshing.\" She was upfront about gaining weight and sent him full-body pics, including nude, so he could decide if he was attracted to her. He was, until their face-time where he saw her body and then later commented that she's too fat. \n\nSo, the guy initially seemed into her, even after seeing her body. But after their face-time, he ignored her for hours before finally saying he values looks a lot and she's too fat. The author then decided not to stay friends because of how he handled it\u2014ignoring her, being rude, and then getting upset when she didn't want to continue the conversation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with him. \n\nFirst, the guy's behavior: he sent her full-body pics and showed his own body. He then said she's too fat, which is a classic body-shaming comment. Ignoring her for hours is inconsiderate and disrespectful. The author felt disrespected and upset because he only valued her when she met his physical standards. \n\nThe author was honest about her weight gain and even mentioned she's losing weight. His rejection based on her size and his poor communication (ignoring her) made her feel bad. Deciding not to stay friends because of his treatment is a personal choice. She's not obligated to maintain a friendship, especially after such a hurtful experience. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The guy didn't respect her feelings by being dismissive and body-shaming. The author's response is justified. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
