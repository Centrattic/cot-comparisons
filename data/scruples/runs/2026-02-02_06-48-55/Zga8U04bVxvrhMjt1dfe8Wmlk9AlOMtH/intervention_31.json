He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: She met a guy on Tinder, they connected on a personal level. She was upfront about her weight gain, sent full-body pictures, including nude ones. They discussed their weight and goals. When they video-called and she showed her body, he later told her he found her too fat. He ignored her for hours before finally texting his feelings, which upset her.\n\nShe decided not to stay friends, feeling he was rude and didn't respect her. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The guy was clear about his preferences\u2014looks matter to him, and he found her too fat. He didn't communicate this upfront, which is a problem. The way he handled it\u2014ignoring her, then coming back with his decision\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The woman, feeling disrespected and hurt, decided to cut ties. \n\nIs she wrong for doing so? Well, if someone is rejected for their body and the person does it disrespectfully, it's reasonable to feel hurt. Wanting to end the friendship isn't wrong. The guy had a right to his preferences, but the way he communicated it was poor. She's not obligated to stay friends with someone who treats her poorly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
