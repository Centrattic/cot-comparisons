He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman met a guy on Tinder and they connected well. She was upfront about her weight gain and sent photos, including nude ones, to be transparent. The guy seemed into her initially, even calling her \"refreshing.\" Then they had a video call where she showed her body and left abruptly. He responded by saying she was too fat and then ignored her for hours before finally messaging her about looks mattering. She decided not to stay friends, and he was upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here: She was honest about her weight. He rejected her based on her size after ignoring her for hours. She felt disrespected because he left her hanging and then was rude. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to continue the friendship.\n\nWell, when someone is rejected, especially in a way that's hurtful, it's natural to want to distance oneself. The guy's behavior was pretty poor\u2014he ignored her for hours after she was vulnerable, then dismissed her because of her weight. She was upfront, which is good, and he didn't handle it well. The fact that he wanted to meet up that same night while ignoring her shows he wasn't being honest about his availability. Also, using her weight as a reason to reject her after she was honest is not cool. \n\nShe's not obligated to stay friends with someone who treated her poorly. People have the right to set boundaries, especially after being disrespected. The guy's actions were inconsiderate and maybe even hurtful. So, she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
