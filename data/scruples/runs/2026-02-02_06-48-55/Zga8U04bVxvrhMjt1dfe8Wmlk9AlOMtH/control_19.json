He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her due to her weight. \n\nFirst, the context: They met on Tinder, connected well, and she was upfront about her weight gain. He initially seemed into her. Then during a video call, he rejected her by saying she was too fat. He also ignored her for hours before explaining his stance. She felt disrespected because he didn't communicate properly, leading to her feeling worse about herself. She decided to cut off contact.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guy's rejection based on her weight is a red flag. Weight-based rejection can be hurtful and often reflects the other person's issues with body image or values. The guy didn't handle the situation well\u2014he ignored her instead of having an honest conversation. That lack of communication is inconsiderate and could make the author feel undervalued.\n\nThe author's decision to stop being friends is about her emotional well-being. If someone treats you poorly or makes you feel bad about yourself, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The fact that he was upset she didn't want to stay friends suggests he might not respect her boundaries. \n\nBut wait, is it wrong to cut someone off after a rejection? Well, relationships (even potential ones) are mutual. If one person is disrespectful or inconsiderate, the other isn't obligated to maintain contact. The author's action is about self-respect and prioritizing her feelings over the other person's. \n\nAlso, the guy's behavior post-rejection\u2014ignoring her for hours and then being upset she ended the conversation\u2014shows immaturity in handling rejection. The author isn't at fault for not wanting to deal with that anymore. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her self-respect and boundaries, which is valid. The guy's actions were the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
