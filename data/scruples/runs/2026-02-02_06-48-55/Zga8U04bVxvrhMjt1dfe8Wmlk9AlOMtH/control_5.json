He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The woman met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and even exchanged photos, including full-body and nude ones. She was upfront about her weight gain, and he initially seemed okay with it. Then during a video call, he had her show her body again. He was overweight, but she accepted that because they both were working on losing weight.\n\nWhen she showed him her body, she felt anxious and left abruptly. He later told her she was \"too fat,\" leading to him ignoring her for hours before finally sending a message about how looks matter. She felt he didn't respect her by leading her on and then being rude, so she decided not to stay friends. Now, he's upset she doesn't want to continue talking.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, communication, and mutual respect. The guy saw her photos, engaged with her, and then changed his mind about her attractiveness. He didn't communicate his feelings clearly, instead ignoring her for hours. That's a form of ghosting, which is generally considered disrespectful. The woman felt disrespected, especially because he had initially shown interest and then acted out when she ended the interaction. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for cutting ties. The guy's behavior seems to have been disrespectful and inconsistent. By the standards of relationships and communication, it's common to feel that if someone isn't honest about their preferences, especially when it comes to attraction, it's reasonable to end the connection. The woman was upfront about her body, and the man's rejection based on appearance after a period of engagement can be seen as invalidating. \n\nMoreover, the man's actions of ignoring her for hours and then expressing his feelings can be seen as emotionally manipulative or inconsiderate. The woman's response\u2014deciding not to stay friends\u2014would be a valid choice in this context. She's not obligated to maintain a relationship where she feels disrespected or where the other person has shown inconsistency in their values (e.g., saying they're okay with weight gain but then rejecting based on it).\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were the issue here\u2014lack of clear communication, invalidating her, and not respecting her feelings. The woman's decision to cut ties is justified.\n"
