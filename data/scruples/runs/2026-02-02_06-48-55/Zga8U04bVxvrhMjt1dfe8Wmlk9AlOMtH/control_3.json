He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with the guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met on Tinder, talked a lot, and he was into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain, even sent full body pics and a nude, so there was no deception. They FaceTimed, and he asked her to show herself, which she did. Then he said she's insecure because she's bigger and later texted that he wanted to meet that night. She left him a message saying she'd take his silence as an answer. He ignored her for hours, then told her he wanted to continue talking, but she didn't want to stay friends.\n\nSo, from what I read, the guy's behavior was pretty hurtful. He rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue, and then ignored her for hours instead of being honest. The author felt disrespected because he changed his behavior after the rejection, going from non-stop communication to silence, which she found cruel. She also mentions that he was upset when she didn't want to stay friends, but she felt justified because of how he treated her.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, she wasn't deceptive. She told him about her weight gain and was even showing him pictures. His issue was with her appearance, not her personality. Then he handled the rejection badly by ghosting her for hours. She responded by cutting off contact, which is her right. People can choose their friends and how they want to interact, especially after being treated disrespectfully. The guy's behavior was inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for distancing herself. He might have wanted to continue the relationship, but after his actions, it's reasonable for her to not want to stay friends. The key points here are honesty from her side and his disrespectful response. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
