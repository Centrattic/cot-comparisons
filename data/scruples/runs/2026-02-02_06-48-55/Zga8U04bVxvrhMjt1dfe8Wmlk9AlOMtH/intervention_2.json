He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected through phone calls and FaceTime. She told him upfront about her weight gain, even sent pictures and was open about her insecurities. Then, during a FaceTime, after showing her body, he told her she was too fat and that looks matter to him. He also ignored her for hours before finally responding. She then decided not to stay friends, and he got upset.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The initial thought of the user is that she's in the wrong, but they want to know my take.\n\nFirst, the man rejected her based on her weight, which is a sensitive issue. The woman had been upfront about her weight gain and even sent photos, so the rejection wasn't a lie or a surprise. The man's response was hurtful, especially the comment about her being a \"bigger girl\" and that she was insecure because of that. That seems like a judgmental statement, which could be hurtful. Also, his behavior of ignoring her for hours and then getting upset when she decided to cut contact seems inconsiderate.\n\nThe woman's reaction is to not want to stay friends. Is that reasonable? If someone rejected you for your body and treated you disrespectfully (ignoring you, not being upfront), it's understandable to want to cut ties. The man's actions included both emotional neglect (ignoring her) and making a comment that could be seen as invalidating her feelings. The woman's decision to end the friendship seems like a self-respecting choice, especially given the man's behavior. \n\nThe key points here are: the man's rejection was based on appearance, his communication was poor (ignoring her), and he made a hurtful comment. The woman had been honest from the start. She's allowed to feel hurt and to not want to maintain a relationship with someone who treats her that way. \n\nSo, in this case, the woman is not in the wrong. The man's actions were the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
