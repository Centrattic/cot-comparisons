He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author (21/F) met a guy on Tinder and they had a good connection. They talked a lot, and he was initially into her personality. She was upfront about her weight gain, even sending full body pics to be honest. He seemed okay with it at first. Then they faced a FaceTime where he asked her to show her body. After that, he told her she was \"too fat,\" leading to her cutting off contact. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends.\n\nSo, the key points here: the guy rejected her based on her weight after initially being attracted. He ignored her for hours, then explained his feelings, and she decided to end the friendship. The author is questioning if she was wrong to do so.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was honest about her appearance. She even sent pictures to be upfront. The guy was okay with her weight at first but later changed his mind. The problem is how he handled the rejection\u2014ignoring her for hours, which made her feel disrespected. She felt that he was being rude, so she cut off contact.\n\nThe guy, on the other hand, might argue that he was just being honest about his preferences. He said he values looks, which is his choice. However, the way he communicated it\u2014by ghosting her for hours before explaining\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after their initial strong connection.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to stay friends. He rejected her in a hurtful way, and she felt disrespected. People have the right to set boundaries and walk away from relationships, especially when the other person behaves disrespectfully. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring her and then being upset when she ended things\u2014don't make her the one at fault. She was honest, and his reaction was the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
