He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected well. She was upfront about her weight gain and sent pictures. They FaceTimed, he asked her to show her body. After she did, he told her she's too fat and ignored her for hours before texting that looks matter. She felt disrespected and decided not to stay friends.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are consent, respect, and mutual boundaries. The guy rejected her based on her weight, which is a physical attribute she had already disclosed. By ignoring her for hours and then being abrupt, he didn't respect her feelings. She felt it was mutual respect when they were connecting, but once he rejected her, he didn't handle it gracefully. \n\nIn such cases, people often feel hurt when someone uses their physical appearance as a deal-breaker after building a connection. The woman being insecure isn't her fault, especially since she had already been transparent. The guy's behavior of ghosting and then being upset when she pulls away seems inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's decision not to stay friends could be seen as self-respect. Why would she want to continue a friendship if the person values her less once they've seen her body? The guy's actions showed that he couldn't handle the situation respectfully, so she's not at fault for cutting ties. \n\nAlso, societal context: Body image issues are real, and being rejected for weight can be hurtful. The man's focus on looks over the connection they had might be problematic. The author's response is about protecting her self-esteem, not being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. She handled it as a way to protect her self-worth after being rejected disrespectfully.\n"
